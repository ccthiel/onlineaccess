MIGRATE DEPRECATED EFFECTS

Deprecated change state tags can be auto migrated for a campaign with the Effects Migrator. A popup box will appear when the table is
started such as below. 

It is highly recommended the campaign is backed up before performing migration.

Preview will produce a story entry of the migration changes without writing those changes to the database. Review these changes prior
to migration. Some changes may be suggested to effects that do not change state and those changes are likely cleanup of extra
whitespace or ;

If the suggested changes are acceptable, use Migrate to migrate effects to the new change state cycyler. This will also create a story
entry detailing the changes made to the database. You may want to delete these story entries after the migration, especially if you are
creating a module for distribution.

You can also bring up the migrate effects popup with the slash command: /migrate_effects

SAVE VS CONDITION

Saves against conditions will automatically be granted adv/dis based on the traits of the Actor making the saving throw. The parser will
match traits with the following verbiage: words ... {advantage,disadvantage} ... words ... {saves,saving throws} ... words ... {condition(s)}
... words. Make up your own homebrew traits and have them process automagiclly.

REPLACE [] WITH ()

When writing NPC effects, the CT doesn't process tags such as [CLASS] [PRF] [LVL]. BCE Gold will allow those tags to be written as
(CLASS) (PRF) (LVL) which enables them to be processed by FG. In addition the BCE tag of [SDC] can also be written as (SDC)

ADD EFFECT ON DAMAGE MODIFIERS

Effects can be automatically added to the source or the target on the damage by either the source of the damage or the target of the
damage. For this to work we need two different effects. Example:

Shadow; SDMGADDT: Strength Drain

The Shadow has strength drain so we put the above effect on the shadow. When the shadow deals damage, it will apply the effect
"Strength Drain" to the target of the damage. The effect "Strength Drain" needs to be an effect listed in our custom effects list or
conditions table. The effect looks like this:

Strength Drain; STR: -1d4; STACK; RESTL

wounds), that reduction is not considered damage
