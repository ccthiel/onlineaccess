Pine Remaka is a character in the campaign.
Had a human best friend Eamon Highridge, liked to explore together. His friend thought the weapons in the shop were cool. He and his friend and found a cave that led to the underdark. They were separated when they encountered a really big spider. He fled to discover a bunch of orcs attacked and plundered his town on the southeastern edge of the High Forest. All were killed or captured. Those that were captured were sold into slavery. Escaped with an older human druid named Alistair Wolfsbane and hid. Grew up as hermits in the ruins of his village. Pine finally felt confident enough to set out on his own in search of his friend and the survivors from his village. He was caught while preparing a ritual spell, overpowered and sold into slavery.

Drawn to the Staff of Valthrax The Wise in the Underdark. He knows it is an artifact of some significance, but doesn't know exactly what it is.
