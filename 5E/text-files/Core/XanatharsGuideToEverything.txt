lb INTRODUCTION 

ENEATH THE BUSTLI NG  CITY OF WATERDEEP, 
a beholder crime  lord keeps tabs on everyone 
and everything-or so the beholder thinks. 
Known as Xanathar, this  bizarre being be 
lieves it can gather information o n everything 
in the DU NGEONS & DRAGONS  multiverse. 
The  be holde r desires to know it a ll! But no 
matter what the  beholder learns and what treasures it 
acquires, its  most prized  possession in a ll  the multi 
verse re ma ins  its goldfis h, Sylgar. 

The firs t major ru les expans ion to the fifth  edition  of 
D&D, Xanathar's Guide to Everything provides a  wealth 
of new optio ns  for the game. Xanathar might not be able 
to realize its  dream to know everything,  but th is  book 
does delve into every major part of the game: adventur 
ers, their adventures, a nd the magic they wield. 

USING THIS BOOK 
Written for both players and Dungeon Masters, this 
book offers options  to enhance campaigns  in any world, 
whether you're adventuring in  the Forgotten Realms, 
anothe r official D&D setti ng, or a world of your own 
creation. T he options here build on  the officia l rules 
contained within the Player's Handbook, the Monster 
Manual, a nd the Dungeon Master's Guide. Think of this 
book as the companion to those volumes. It builds on 
their foundation , exploring pathways first laid in  those 
publications. Nothing herein is required for a D&D cam 
paig n-this  is  not a fourth core  rulebook- but we hope it 
will  provide you new ways to enjoy the game. 

Chapter 1 offers character options  that expand on 
those offered in the Player's Handbook . Chapter 2  is a 
toolkit for the DM that provides new resources for run 
ning the game and designing adventures, a ll  of it build 
ing on the Monster Manual and the Dungeon Master's 
Guide. Chapter 3 presents new spells  for player charac 
ters and spellcasting monsters to unleash. 

Appendix A provides g uidance on running a shared 
campa ign, similar to the activities s taged  by the D&D 
Adventurers  League, and appendix B conta ins  a  host of 
tables that a llow you to quickly generate na mes fo r the 
cha racters  in your D&D stories. 

As you pe ruse the m any options herein , you' ll  come 

across observatio ns  from Xanathar itself.  Like the 
beholder's roving mind, your reading will take you to 
places in the game fa miliar and new. May you enjoy 
the journey! 

U NEART H ED  A RCA NA 
Much of the material in  this book originally appea red in 
Unearthed Arcana, a  series of online articles we publish 
to explore rules that might officially become part of the 
game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end  up 
resonating with  fans and are set aside fo r the time being. 
The Unearthed Arcana m aterial that inspired the options 
in  the following chapters was well  received a nd , thanks to 
feedba ck from  thousands of you,  has been refined  into the 
official  forms presented  here. 

INTRODUCTION 

THE  C O RE  RULES 
This  book relies on the ru les in the  three core  ru le 
books . T he game  especia lly ma kes  freque nt use  of 
the  rules  in chapters 7- 10 of the Player's Handbook: 
"Using Ability S cores," "Adve ntur ing," "Combat," a nd 
"Spellcasting." That book's  a ppendix A is  als o crucial; 
it contains  defini tions  of conditio ns, like  invisible a nd 
prone . Yo u don't need  to k now the  ru les by heart, but it's 
helpfuJ  to know w he re  to find  them whe n you need  the m . 
If you'r e a  DM, you s ho uld a lso k now where  to  look 
things  up in the Dungeon Mas ter's Guide , especia lly the 
ru les on how  magic ite ms  work (see chapte r 7 of th a t 
book).  T he  introduction of the Mons ter Manual is your 
guide on how to use a  mons te r's  stat block. 

THE DM ADJUDICATES  THE RULE S 
One  ruJe  ove rr ides a ll  othe rs : the DM is  the fina l a uthor 
ity on bow the  rules work in play. 

Rules a re  part of w ha t makes D&D a  game , rathe r 
tha n j ust improvised s torytelling. The ga me's  ru les are 
meant to he lp orga ni ze, a nd even  ins pire , the action of a 
D&D campa ign. The  rules a re a  tool , a nd  we wa nt our 
tools  to  be  as effective as p ossible . No  ma tte r how  good 
those  too ls  m ight be , they need a  group of playe rs  to 
br ing the m  to life  a nd a DM to guide  their use. 

The DM is  key. Ma ny unexpected eve nts  can occur in 
a  D&D  campaig n, a nd no set of ru les could  reasona bly 
account for every contingency. If the  ru les  tried  to do s o, 
the ga me  would  become a s log. An alte rnat ive wo uld  be 
for the  rules to sever ely lim it w ha t cha racte rs  can do, 
which would  be contra ry to the open-endedness of D&D . 
He re's the  path th e ga me ta kes: it lays a fou ndatio n of 
ru les that a  DM can build on, a nd  it embraces the  DM's 
role as the  bridge  be tween the  things  the  r ules  address 
and the  things  they don't. 

TEN R ULES T O  REMEMBER 

A few  r ules in the core  rulebooks  some times trip up a 
new  player  or DM. Here are  te n of those ru les . Keep 
ing them  in mi nd will help you  inter pre t the optio ns in 
this book. 

EXCEPTIONS  SUPERSEDE  GENERAL RULES 
Gener al ru les  govern each pa rt of the  game . F or exam 
ple,  the combat ru les tell you tha t melee weapon attacks 
use Streng th a nd ra nge d weapon attacks  use Dex terity. 
T ha t's  a ge neral ru le, a nd a ge ne ra l ru le is  in effect as 
long as somethi ng  in  the ga m e doesn't explicitly s ay 
otherwise. 

T he ga me  also includes ele me nts - class features , 
s pells , magic item s , monster a bilities, a nd the  li ke- that 
sometimes  contrad ic t a gene ra l rule. When a n exception 
a nd a  genera l ru le d is agree, the exception wins . For ex 
ample, if a  feature s ays you can  m ake  melee weapon at 
tacks  us ing yo ur Charisma, you can do so, eve n  though 
tha t s tateme nt disagrees with the general ru le. 

ROUND  DOWN 
W he neve r you  divide  or multiply a  n umbe r in  the gam e, 
round down if you e nd up with a  fraction, even  if the 
fraction is one-half or greater. 

ADVANTAGE  AND  DISADVA NTA GE 
Even  if more  than one  factor gives you adva ntage  or 
d is advantage on a  roll, yo u have it only once, a nd if you 
have adva ntage and d is adva ntage on the same  roll , they 
ca ncel each other. 

C OMBINI NG  D I FFERE NT EFFECTS 
Diffe re nt gam e effects  can affect a  ta rge t at the same 
time. For example, two di ffe re nt be nefits  can give you 
a  bonus  to your Armor Class. But w hen  two or mo re 
e ffects  have the s ame  proper  name, o nly one of the m 
(the  most powe rful one  if their be ne fits a re n't identical) 
applies while  the d urations  of the  effects  overlap. For ex 
a mple, if bless is cast o n yo u w hen you're s till  unde r the 
e ffect of an earl ie r bless, yo u gain the  benefit of o nly o ne 
casti ng. S imila rly, if yo u're  in  the  radius of m ore than 
one  Aura of P rotectio n, yo u benefit only from  the one 
that grants the  highest bonus. 

R E ACTION  TIMIN G 
Certa in ga me  fea tu res let you take  a s pecial action, 
called a  reaction, in respo nse to s ome event. Making 
opportunity attacks  a nd casting  the shield s pell  ar e  two 
ty pical uses of reactio ns . If yo u're  uns u re when a  reac 
tio n occurs  in re la tio n  to its  trigger, here's the  rule : the 
reaction  ha ppens  a fter its  trigger completes, unless  the 
descr iption of the  reaction explicitly says  otherwise. 

Once you ta ke a  reaction, you can't ta ke a nothe r one 

until the s ta rt of your next turn . 

RESISTANCE AND VULN ERABILITY 
He re's t he order that you apply m odifiers  to damage: (1) 
a ny r elevant da m age immunity, (2) any add ition or s ub 
traction to the damage, (3) o ne  relevant damage resis  
tance, a nd (4) one  releva nt damage  vulne rability. 

Even if multiple sources give you  resis ta nce to a  ty pe 
of da mage you're  ta king, you can apply resis tance to it 
o nly o nce. T he same  is  true of vulne rability. 

PROFICIENCY  BONUS 
If your proficie ncy bonus  a pplies to a  roll, you can add 
the  bonus  o nly o nce to  the  ro ll, even  if m ultiple  th ings in 
the  game s ay your bonus  a pplies. Moreover, if mor e  than 
one  th ing te lls you to doub le or ha lve yo ur bo n us, you 
double it only once or ha lve it only once before apply-
ing it. Whethe r m ultiplie d, d ivided, or left at its normal 
value,  the  bonus  can  be  used  only once per roll. 

BONUS ACTIQN SPELLS 
If you wa nt to cast a s pell that ha s a cas ting time of 1 
bonus  action, re membe r that you can't cas t any othe r 
s pe lls  before or a fte r it o n  the same  turn, except for can 
trips  with a casting time of 1 action . 

CONCENTRATIO N 
As  soon as you s ta rt casting a s pell  or us ing a s pecia l 
ability that req ui res co ncentration, you r concentration 
on a nother effect e nds instantly. 

( 

'TEMPORARY H I T  POI N TS 
Tempora ry hit poi nts a ren't cumulative. If you have  tem  
porary hit points  a nd receive  more of them , you don't 
add them  toge ther, unle ss  a gam e  feature says you can. 
Ins te ad, yo u decide  which  te mporary hit points to keep.

CHARACTER OPTIONS 

H E  MAI N  FIGURES I N  ANY D &D CAMPA I GN 
a re t he  c ha racters  c reate d  by the  players. 
The  heroics, folly,  righteous ness, and po 
tential villainy of your cha racters  are at the 
heart of the story. This c ha pte r  provides a 
variety of new options for t he m , foc usi ng 
on additiona l subclasses for each of the 

classes in  the Player's Handbook. 

Each class offers a  cha racter-de fining choice at 1st, 

2nd, or 3rd level that un locks a  series of special fea 
tures, n ot available to the class as a  whole. That c h oice 
is called a  subclass. Each class has a  collective  term 
that describes its  subclasses; in the fighter, for  instance, 
the s ubcl asses are called martial arch etypes, a nd in the 
palad in, they're sacred  oaths. The  table  below ide ntifies 

SUB C LASSES 

each o f the s ubclasses in  this  book. In addition, the sec 
tion for druids presents  details  on how  the Wild Shape 
feat ure w orks, and th e warlock receives a collectio n of 
new choices for the class's  E ld ritch Invocations  feature. 
Each of the class presentations leads off with advice 
on how to add d epth a nd detail to your c haracte r's pe r 
son ality.  You can use the  tables in these sections as a 
source of inspi ration, or  roll a  die to randomly deter 
m in e a  result if desi red. 

Following the  subclasses, the section called "This Is 
Your Life" presents  a  series o f tables for adding deta il  to 
your character's backstory. 

The c h apter concludes with a  selection of feats for  the 

races in the Player's Handbook, offering ways to delve 
deeper into a  c h a racter's racial ide ntity.

Totem 
A tuft of fur from a solitary wolf that you be 
friended during a  hunt 
Three eagle feathers given to you  by a wise sha-
man, who told you they would  play a role in  deter 
mining your fate 
A necklace made from the claws of a young cave 
bear that you slew singlehandedly as a child 
A small leathe r pouch holding three s tones that 
represent your ancestors 
A few  small  bones from  the first beast you  killed, 
tied together with colored wool 
An  egg-sized stone in the shape of your spirit ani  
mal that appeared one day in your belt pouch 

TATTOOS 

The members of ma ny barbarian clans decorate their 
bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a s ignif 
icant moment in the life  of the bearer or the bearer 's 
a ncestors , or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. 
As with personal tote ms, a  ba rba ria n's ta ttoos might or 
mig ht not be re lated to an a nimal s pirit. 

Each tattoo a  barbaria n displays contributes to that in 
dividual's  identity. If your character wears tattoos, what 
do they look like, and what do they represent?

Images of your s pirit an imal are tattooed along 
your weapon arm and  hand. 
The eyes of a wolf are ma rked on your back to help 
you see and ward off evil spirits . 

SUPERSTITIONS 

Barba rians va ry widely in how they unders tand life. 
Some follow gods and look for guidance from those 
deities in  the cycles of nature a nd the a nimals  they en 
counter. These barbarians  believe that s pirits  inhabit 
the plants and a nimals  of the world, a nd the barbarians 
look to them  for ome ns  a nd  power. 

Other barba rians trust only in  the blood that runs in 
thei r veins a nd the steel they hold in their ha nds. They 
have  no use for the invisible world, ins tead relying on 
their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts 
they emulate. 

BARBARIAN 

I  HAVE WITNESSED THE I NDOMITABLE PERFORMANCE OF 
barbarians on the.field of battle, and it makes me wonder 
what force lies at the heart of their rage. 

-Seret, archwizard 

The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of 
a  barbarian in  the same way that a gentle breeze is  akin 
to a  furious  thunders torm. The barbarian's driving force 
comes from a  place that transcends mere e motion, mak 
ing its  manifestation a ll  the mo re terrible. Whether the 
impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from 
forging a  Link with a s pirit animal, a  ragi ng barbarian 
becomes  able to per form s upernatural feats of s treng th 
a nd endurance. The outburst is  tempora ry, but while it 
lasts, it ta kes over body a nd mind, driving the barbarian 
on despite  peril and injury, until the last enemy falls. 

It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that 

is a straightforward application of the classic arche 
type- a  brute, and us ually a dimwitted one at that, who 
rus hes  in where others  fear to tread. But not all the 
barbarians in the world are cut from  that cloth, so you 
can certainly put your own spin on things. Eithe r way, 
cons ide r adding som e f:lourishes to make your barbaria n 
s tand out from a ll  others; see the following sections for 
some ideas. 

PERSONAL TOTEMS 

Barbarians  tend to  travel light, carrying little  in the way 
of personal e ffects or other unnecessary gear. The few 
possessions  they do ca rry often  include s ma ll  items that 
have s pecial s ignificance. A personal totem is s ignificant 
because it has a mys tical origin or is  tied to an import 
ant moment in the character 's  life- perhaps  a remem 
brance from the barbarian's  past or a ha rbinge r of what 
lies ahead. 

A personal totem of this sort might be associated with 

a  barbarian's spirit a nimal, or mig ht actually be the to 
tem object for the a nimal, but s uch a connection is  not 
essential. One who has a  bear totem spi rit, for ins tance, 
could still carry a n eagle's feather as a  personal totem. 
Cons ider creating one or more  personal totems for 
your character- objects that hold a specia l link to your 
character's pas t or future. Think about how a totem 
might affect your cha racter's  actions.

Both of these attitudes can give rise  to s upersti 
tions. These beliefs are often passed down within a 
family or shared among the  me mbers of a clan or a 
hunting group. 

If your barbarian character has a ny superstitions, 
were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they 
the result of personal experience? 

SUPERSTITIO N S

Superstition 

If you disturb the bones of the dead, you  inherit all 
the troubles that plagued them in  life. 
Never trust a  wizard. They 're all  devils  in  disgui se, 
especially the friendly ones. 
Dwarves have lost t heir spirits, and are  almost like 
the undead . That's why they live underground. 
Magical things  bring trouble. Never s lee p with a 
magic object within ten feet of you . 
When you walk through  a graveyard,  be sure to 
wear silver, or a ghost might jump into your body. 
If an elf looks you  in  the eyes , she's trying to read 
your thoughts.

PRIMAL PATHS 
At 3rd level, a  barbarian gains  the Primal Path feature. 
The following options are available to a  barbarian, in 
addition to those offe red in the Player's Handbook: the 
Path of the Ancestral Guardian, the Path of the Storm 
Herald, and the Path of the Zealot.

PATH  OF THE ANCESTRAL  GUARDIAN 

Some barbarians ha il from cultures  that revere their an 
cestors. These tribes teach  that the warriors of the  past 
linger in  the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and 
protect the living. When a  barbarian who follows this 
path rages, the  barbaria n contacts the spirit world and 
calls  on these guardian s pirits for aid. 

Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians 
can bette r fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In 
order to ceme nt ties to their ancestral guardians, bar 
barians  who follow this path cover themselves in elabo 
rate tattoos  that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These 
tattoos  tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters 
and other fearsome rivals.

ANCESTRAL PROTECTORS 
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, s pectral 
warriors  appear when you enter your rage. While you're 
raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your 
turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder 
its  attacks. Until the s ta rt of your next turn, that target 
has disadvantage on a ny attack roll  that isn't against 
you, and when the target hits a creature othe r than you 
with a n attack, that creature has resistance to the da m 
age dealt by  the attack. The effect on the target e nds 
early if your rage ends. 

SPIRIT SHIELD 
Beginn ing at 6th level, the guardia n spirits  that a id you 
can provide s upernatural protection to those you de 
fe nd. If you a re  raging a nd a nother creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. 

Whe n you reach certa in levels  in  this class, you can 
reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level a nd  by 
4d6 at 14th level. 

CONSULT THE SPIRITS 
At 10th level, you gain the a bility to cons ult with your 
ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury  or 
clairvoyance spell, without using a s pe ll  s lot or material 
components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, 
this use of clairvoyance invisibly s ummons o ne of your 
a ncestra l spirits  to the chosen location. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for these spells. 

After you cast e ither spell in thjs  way, you can't use 
this feature again  until you finish a s hort or long rest. 

VENGEFUL ANCESTORS 
At 14th level, your ancestra l spirits g row powerful 
enough to reta liate. When you use your Spirit Shield to 
reduce the damage of a n attack, the attacker takes an 
amount of force damage equa l to the damage that your 
Spirit Shield prevents. 

PATH  OF THE  STORM HERALD 

All  barba rians ha rbor a fury within. Their rage g ra nts 
them s uperior stre ngth, durability, and speed. Ba rba r 
ia ns who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn 
to trans form  tha t rage into a  m antle of primal magic, 
which swirls around them. When in a  fury, a  barbar ia n 
of this  path taps  into the  forces of nature to create pow 
erful magical effects. 

Storm heralds  a re typically elite champions who train 

alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect 
nature. Other storm heralds  hone  their cra ft  in lodges in 
regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the 
world's end, o r deep in the hottest deserts.

STOR M  AURA 
Starting at 3rd level, you ema nate a s tormy, m agical 
aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you 
in every direction , but not throug h total cover. 

Your a ura has an effect that activates when you enter 
your rage, and you can activate  the effect again on each 
of your turns as a  bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or 
tundra. Your aura's effect depe nds on tha t chosen envi 
ronment, as d~ta iled below. You  can cha nge your envi 
ronment choice whenever you gain a level in this class. 
If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC 

equa ls 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitu 
tion modifier. 

D esert. When this effect is  activated, all other crea 
tures in your aura take 2 fire damage each. The damage 
increases when you reach certa in  levels in  this class, in 
creasi ng to 3 a t 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, 
and 6 at 20th level. 

Sea. When this  effect is  activated , yo u can choose one 
other creature you ca n see in your aura. The  target must 
ma ke a Dexte rity saving throw. The target takes l d6 
lightning da mage on a  failed save, or half as much dam 
age on a s uccessful one. The da mage increases when 
you reach certain levels  in  this class, increasing to  2d6 
at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, a nd 4d6 a t 20th level. 

Tundra. When this effect is activated, each creature of 
your choice in you r aura gains  2 temporary hit points, as 
icy spirits inure  it to s uffering. The temporary hit points 
increase when you reach certa in levels  in this class, in 
creasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, 
and 6 at 20th level. 

STORM  SOUL 
At 6th level, the storm g ra nts you benefits even when 
your aura isn't active. The bene fits are based on the en 
viro nment you chose for your Storm Aura. 

Deser t. You gain resistance to fire da mage, a nd you 
don't s uffer the effects of extrem e heat, as descr ibed in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, 
you can touch a  fla mmable object that isn't being worn 
or carried by a nyone else a nd set it on fire. 

Sea. You gain resistance to  lightning damage, and 
you can breathe  underwater. You  a lso gain a swimming 
s peed of 30 feet. 

Tundra. You  gain resistance to cold da mage, a nd you 
don't s uffe r the effects of extreme cold, as described in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide. Moreover, as an action, 
you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, 
which melts after 1 minute. This action fai ls if a creature 
is in the cube. 

SHIELDING STORM 
At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm 
to  protect others. Each creature of your choice has the 
damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul  fea 
ture while the creature is  in your Storm Aura. 

RAGING STORM 
At 14th level, the power of the storm you c hanne l grows 
mightie r, lashing out at your foes. T he  effect is  based on 
the e nvironment you c hose for your Storm Aura. 

Desert. Immed ia te ly after a c reatu re  in your a ura nits 

you with a n a ttack, you can use you r  reactio n to for ce 
that c reature  to make a  Dex te rity saving  throw. On a 
fa iled save, the creature  takes fire d amage equal to half 
your b a rbarian level. 

Sea. When you hi t a  c reature in your a ura with an 
a ttack, you can use your reaction to fo rce that creature 
to make a  Strength saving throw. On a  fa iled save, the 
creature  is  knocked prone, as if struck by a wave. 

Tundra. Wheneve r  t he  effect of your Storm Aura is  ac 
tivated, you can choose one  c reature you can see in th e 
aura. That creature mus t s ucceed on a  Strengt h saving 
throw, or its speed is reduced  to 0  until t he s tart of your 
next turn , as magical frost covers it. 

PATH  OF THE  ZEALOT 
Some deities inspire  th eir followers  to pitc h  the m selves 
into a  fe rocious battle  fury. T hese barbarians  are zea l 
ots- warriors wh o cha nne l their rage into powerful dis 
plays of divine  power. 

A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D  inspire 
their followers to e mbrace this path. Tempus from the 
Forgotte n  Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Grey 
hawk a re  a ll  prime examples. In gene ral, t he  gods who 
inspire zealots a re d eities o f combat, d estruction, and 
viole nce. Not all are e vil, but few are good.

DIVINE FURY 
Starting when you c hoose this path at 3 rd  level, you can

you're  raging, the first creature you hit on each o f your 
turns with a  weapon attack takes extra damage equa l 
to 1d6 + h alf your barbar ian level.  The extra d amage is 
necrotic  or radiant; you choose the  type of damage w hen 
you gain  this feature. 

WARRIOR OF THE  Goos 
At 3rd level, your soul is  marked for e ndless battle. If a 
spell, s uc h as raise d ead , has the sole effect of restoring 
you to life  (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need ma 
te ri a l components to cast the spell on you. 

FANATI CAL Focus 
Starting at 6th level, t he  divine power that fuels your 
rage can protect you. If you fa il  a  saving t hrow w hile 
you're raging, you can re roll it, and you must use the 
new ro ll.  You can use th is  ability only once per rage.

Beginning a t 14t h level, t he  divine  power t hat fuels your

While you're raging, having 0  hit points doesn't knock 

you unconscious. You still must make death saving 
throws, and you s uffe r  the normal effects of taking 
damage while  at 0  hit points. However, if you would die 
due  to failing death saving throws, you do n't die until 
your rage ends, and you die  then only if you still  have 0 
hit points.

INSTRUMENT 

In a bard's quest for  the ultimate performance and the 
highest acclaim, one's instrument is at least as import 
ant as one's voca l ability. The instrument's quality of 
m anufactu re is a critica l  factor, of course; the best ones 
m ake the best music, and some bards are continually 
on the lookout for an improvem ent. Perhaps just as im 
portant, though, is the instrument's own entertainment 
value; those that ar e bizarrely constructed or made of 
exotic mater ials are likely to leave a l asting impression 
on an audience. 

You might have an "off th e rack"  instrument, perhaps 

because it's all you can afford  right now. Or, if your 
first instrument was gifted to you , it might be of a more 
elaborate sor t. Are you satisfied with the in strument you 
have, or do you aspire to replace it with something truly 
distinctive?

EMBARRASSMENT 

A l most every bard  has suffered at least one bad experi 
ence in front of an audience, and cha nces are you're no 
exception. No one becomes famous right away, after all; 
perhaps you had a few small difficulties early in your ca 
reer, or maybe it took you a while to restore your reputa 
tion a fter one agonizing night when t he fates conspired 
to bring about your t heatrica l ruin . 

BARD 

MUSIC I S THE FRU IT  OF THE DJVI NE TREE THAT V IBRATES 
with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, 
can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the 
source of that power? Ah.  then what manner of music they 
would bring to this world! 

- fletcher Danairia, master bard 

Bards bring levity dur i ng grave times; they impa rt wis 
dom to offset igno rance; and  they make the rid ic ulous 
seem subl ime. Bards are preser vers of ancient histo ry, 
their songs and tal es perpetuati ng the memory of g reat 
events down  through time-knowledge so important 
that it is memor ized and passed along as oral history,  to 
survive even w hen no written record remains. 

It is also the bard's role to chronicle sma ller  and more 

contemporary events- the stories of today's heroes, 
including their feats of valor as well as their less than 
impressive failures. 

Of course, the world has many people who ca n carry 
a tune or tell a good story, and there's much more to any 
adventuring bard than a glib tongue and a melodious 
voice. Yet what truly sets bards apart from other s- and 
from one another-are the style and substance o f their 
perform ances. 

To grab and hold the attention of an audience, bards 

are typically  fl amboyant a nd outgoing when they p er 
form . The most  fa mous of them are essentially  the D & D 
world's equ ivalent of pop stars. If you're play ing a bard, 
consider using one of you r  favor ite musicians as a role 
model  for your character. 

You can add some unique aspects to your bard charac 

ter by considering the suggestions that follow. 

DEFINING WORK 

Every successfu l bard is ren owned for at least one piece 
of performance art, typically a song or a poem that 
is popular  with everyone who hears it. These perfor 
mances are spoken abou t for years by those w ho view 
them, and some spectators have h ad  their lives forever 
cha nged because of the experience. 

If your character is just star ting out, your ultimate de 
fining work is likely in the future. But in order to m ake 
any sort of living at your professi on, chances are you 
already have a piece or two in your r epertoire that have 
proven to be aud ience pleasers.

on w ith the show (if possible) or  promising to com e back 
tomorrow w ith a new performa nce that's guara nteed

A  BARD'S  MUSE 
Natura lly,  ever y  bard has a r epertoire o f songs and sto 
ries. Some bards are general ists w ho can draw from 
a wide range of topics for each per formance, a nd w ho 
take pride in their versatility. Others adopt a more per  
sonal approach  to thei r a r t, driven by  th eir attachment to 

a muse- a p ar t icular concept t hat inspires much o f w h at 
those bards do in front o f an audience. 

A  bard  who follows a muse generally does so to gain a 
d eeper  understanding of w h at that muse represents and 
how to best convey that understand ing to other s t h roug h 
per for mance. 

If your bard cha racter  has a m use, it could be one of 
the three d escribed here, or one o f your own devising. 

Nature. You  feel a k inship w ith the natural  world, a nd 

its beauty and mystery inspire you . For you , a tree is 
deeply symbolic, its roots delving into t he da rk  unknown 
to draw forth  t he power of the earth , wh ile its branches

nature share their  secrets with druids and sages, open

Love. You  ar e o n  a quest to identify  the essence o f 
true love. Though you  do not disdain the superficial 
love of flesh and form, the deeper  form of love that ca n

CHAPTER  I  I CHARACTER OPTIONS 

Confiict. Dra ma embodies conflict, a nd the best 
s tories have conflict as a  key elem ent.  From the morn

battle, from a love r's s pat to a rift between powerful 
dynasties, conflict is what ins pires ta le-te llers like you to 
create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in 
some  people , caus ing their heroic na ture to s hine  forth

BARD  COLLEGES 
At 3rd  level, a  ba rd gains  the Ba rd College feature. The 
following optio ns  are availa ble  to a  bard, in addition 
to those offered in  the Player's Handbook : the College 
of G la mour, the College of Swords , and the College 
of Whis pe rs. 

COLLEGE  OF  GLAMOUR 
The College of Gla mour is  the  home of bards who mas 
te red the ir craft in the vibra nt realm of the Feywild or 
under the tutelage of someone who dwelled the re . Tu 
to red by satyrs , eladrin, a nd other fey, these ba rds  learn 
to use their magic to delight and captivate othe rs. 

The ba rds of this college are  regarded with a mixture 
of awe and fear. Their performances are the s tuff of leg 
end. Thes e ba rds  a re so eloquent that a speech or song 
that one of them  performs can cause captors  to release 
the ba rd unharmed and can  luU  a furio us  dragon into 
complacency. T he same magic that allows them to quell 
beasts can a lso bend minds. Villainous  bards of this 
college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing 
their magic to turn their hosts  into thra lls. Heroic ba rds 
of this  college ins tead use this  power to gladde n the 
downtrodden a nd  undermine oppressors.

Whe n a creature gains  these te mpora ry hit points , it 
can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, 
without provoking opportunity attacks. 

T he number of temporary hit points  increases when 
you r each certain levels  in  this class, increasing to 8 at

CHAPTER 1  I CHARACTER OPTIONS 

ENTHRALLING PERFORMANCE 
S tarting at 3r9 level, you can cha rge your performa nce 
with seductive, fey  magic. 

If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt 
to ins pire wonder in your audience by s inging,  reciting 
a  poem , o r dancing. At the end of the  per formance, 
choose a  number of humanoids w ithin 60  feet of you 
who watched and lis tened to a ll  of it, up to a number 
equa l to your Cha ris ma  modifier (minimum of o ne). 
Each  target mus t s ucceed on a Wis dom s aving throw 
agains t your s pell save DC o r be cha rmed by you. While 
charmed in this way, the ta rget idolizes you, it s peaks 
glowingly of you to a nyone who ta lks  to it, and it hinders 
anyone who opposes you, a lthough it avoids violence 
unless it was already inclined  to fight on your behalf. 
This  effect ends  on a target a fter  1 ho ur, if it ta kes any 
damage, if you a ttack it, or if it witnesses you attacking 
or dam aging a ny of its a llies. 

If a ta rget s ucceeds  on  its saving throw, the ta rget has

action , you cast command, without expending a s pell 
slot, and yo u take on a n appeara nce of unearthly beauty 
for 1 minute or until your concentration ends  (as if you 
were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you 
can cast command as a  bonus  action on each of your 
turns, without expending a spell s lot. 

Any creature charmed by you automa tically fails 
its saving throw aga ins t the command you cast with 
this  feature. 

Once you use this  feature , you can't use it again until 

you finis h a  long rest. 

UN BREAKA BLE  M AJ ESTY

otherwo rldly aspect that m akes you look more lovely 
a nd fierce. 

In addition, as a  bo nus action, you can assume a mag 

ically majestic presence for 1 minute or until you are 
incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature 
tr ies to attack you for the firs t time on a  turn, the at 
tacker mus t make a  Charis ma saving throw agains t your 
spell save DC. On a failed save , it can't attack you on this 
turn , and it must choose a new  ta rget for its  attack or the 
attack is wasted. On a s uccessful s ave, it can attack you 

on this turn, but it h as disadva ntage on a ny saving throw 
it makes aga ins t your spells  on your next turn. 

Once you assume  this  m ajestic  presence, you can't do 

so again until you  finis h a s ho r t or lo ng  rest. 

COLLEGE  OF  SWORDS 

~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Bards  o f the  College of Swords are called  blad es, a nd 
they e ntertain t hrough da ring feats of weapon  prowess. 
Blades perfor m  s tunts s uch as sword swallowing, knife 
t hrowing and juggling, a nd mock combats. Though they 
use  their  weapons to e nte r tai n, t hey a re a ls o  hig h ly 
tra ined  a nd s killed warriors  in  their ow n right. 

Their tale nt w ith weapons  inspires m a ny blades to 
lead double lives. One blade might use a  circ us  troupe 
as cover  for nefar ious  deeds s uc h as assassi na tion, ro b 
b e ry, a nd blackmai l.  Othe r  blades s trike  at the wicked, 
bringing justice to  bea r against the  c ruel a nd powerful. 
Most troupes are happy to accept a  blade's  talent for the 
exci teme nt it adds to a p e rformance, but few e ntertain 
ers fully trus t a  blade  in  the ir ranks. 

Blades who abandon their lives as e nte r tainers  have 

ofte n  run into trouble  that m akes maintainin g their 
secret activities impossib le. A  bla de  ca ug ht stealing or 
e ngaging in vigila nte jus tice is  too great a  liabili ty for 
mos t troupes. Wit h their weapon skills  a nd mag ic,  these 
b lades eithe r take  up work as e n forcers for thie ves' 
guilds or s trike  ou t on the ir own as ad venturers.

Once you use this feat ure, you can't use it again until 

you finish a s hort or long rest. 

MANTLE OF WHISPERS 
At 6th level, you gain the ability to adopt a  huma noid's 
persona. When a  huma noid dies within 3 0 feet of you, 
you can m agically capture its  shadow using your reac 
tion. You  retain this s hadow until you use it or you finis h

You can use the s hadow as a n action. When you do so, 

it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that 
appears on you. You  now look like  the dead person, but 
healthy a nd a'live. This disguise lasts  for 1 hour or until 
you end  it as a bonus action. 

While you're in the disguise, you gain access to a ll 
information that the humanoid would freely s hare with 
a casua l acquainta nce. Such information includes gen 
eral details  on its background a nd personal life, but 
doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that 
you can pass yourself off as the  person by drawing on 
its  memories. 

Another creature can see through this disguise by 
s ucceeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by 
your Cha risma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus

can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw 
against your s pell save DC. It automatically succeeds 
if it doesn't s hare a lang uage with you or ii it can't hear 
you.  On a successful saving throw, your w hisper sounds 
like unintelligible mumbling a nd  has no effect. 

On a fai led saving throw,  the target is cha rmed by you 

for the next 8 hours or until you or your a llies attack it, 
da mage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It inter 
prets the whispers as a description of its mos t mortify 
ing secret.  You gain no k nowledge of this secret, but the 
target is  convinced you know it. 

The cha rm ed creature obeys your commands  for fear 

that you will reveal its secret. It won't ris k its life  for 
you or fight for you,  unless it was already inclined to 
do so. It grants you favors and gifts  it would offer to a 
close friend. 

When the effect ends, the creature  has no understand 

ing of why it held you in such fear. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again  until 

you finis h a long rest. 

MASTER'S  FLOURISH 
Starting at 14th level, whenever you use a Blade Flour 
ish option, you can roll a d6 a nd  use it instead of expend 
ing a Bardic Inspiration die. 

COLLEGE  OF WHISPERS 

Most folk are  happy to welcome a ba rd into their midst. 
Bards of the College of Whispers use this  to the ir ad 
vantage. They appear to be li ke other ba rds , s haring 
news, singing songs, a nd telling tales to the audiences 
they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its 
students that they are wolves among s heep. These  ba rds 
use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets  and 
turn them against others through extortion and threats . 

Many other ba rds  hate the College of Whispers, 

viewing it as a parasite  that uses a  bard's reputation to 
acquire wealth a nd power. For this  reason, members 
of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typ 
icalJy claim to follow some other college, or they keep 
their actual calling secret in order to  infiltrate and ex 
ploit royal courts a nd other settings  of power.

CHAPTER 1  J  CHARACTER  O PTIONS 

CLERIC 

TO BECOME A  CLERJC  IS TO BECOME A  MESSENGER OF 
the gods.  The power the divine offers is great,  but it always 
comes with tremendous responsibility. 

-Riggby the p a tria r ch 

KEEPSAKE 
Many clerics have items a mo ng their personal gear that 
symbo lize their fa ith , re mind the m  of the ir vows, or oth  
e rwise he lp to keep them on the ir chosen  p a ths. Even 
though s uc h a n item is  not imbued w ith divine power, 
it is  vita lly importa nt to its  owner  because of what it 
re presents. 

Almost a ll  the folk in the world who  revere a  deity live 
the ir lives witho ut ever being directly touched by a  di 
vine  be ing. As s uch , they ca n  never  know what it  feels 
like  to be a  cleric- som eone who is  not only a  devout 
wors hiper, but who has a lso been invested with a  mea 
s ure  of a  de ity's power. 

The question has lo ng  been debate d : Does a  m o rta l 
become a  cleric as a conseque nce of deep devotion to 
one's deity, thereby attracting  the god's favor? Or is  it the 
de ity who sees the potential in a  pe rson a nd calls  that 
individual into service? U ltimately, perhaps, the  answer 
does n't m atte r. However cle rics com e  into bein g,  the 
world  need s clerics as much as clerics a nd de ities need 
each othe r. 

If you 're  playing a  cleric c haracter, the  following sec

their god with the qualities needed to become a  cleric. 
To prepare for th is  new duty, candida tes typica lly  re 
ceive ins truction from a cleric of a  te mple  or  another 
p lace of study devoted to their deity.

The following domain options are avai lable to a cleric,

FORGE  DOMAIN 

The gods of the forge are  patrons of a rtisans who work 
with metal, from a  humble blacksmith who keeps a 
village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf 
artisa n whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have 
felled demon lords. The gods of the fo rge teach that, 
with patience a nd hard work, eve n the most intractable 
meta l can be transformed from a  lump of ore  to a beau 
tifu lly wrought object. Clerics of these deities search 
for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines 
overrun by ores, and  uncover rare and wondrous mate 
r ia ls  necessary to create potent magic items. Followers 
of these gods take great pride in their work, and they 
are willing to craft and use heavy armor and power-
ful  weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain 
include Gond , Reorx, Ona tar, Morad in, Hephaestus, 
and Goibhn iu.

CL.E R IC.  OF  THE  F ORGE 

SERVING  A  PA NTHEON ,  PHILOSOPH Y,  OR  FORCE 

The typical cleric is an ordained  servant of a particular god 
and chooses a Divine  Domain associated with that deity. 
The cleric's magic flows from the god  or the god's sacred 
realm , and often the cleric bears a holy symbol that rep 
resents that divinity. 

Some clerics,  especially in a world like Eberron, serve a 
whole pantheon, rather than  a single deity. In certain cam 
paigns, a cleric might instead serve a cosmic force, such 
as  life or death, or a philosophy or concept, such as love, 
peace,  or one of the  nine alignments. Chapter 1 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide explores options like these, in the 
section "Gods ofYour World ." 

Talk with your DM about the divine option s available in 
your campaign, whether they're gods, pantheons, philos 
ophies, or cosmic forces. Whatever being or thing your 
cleric ends up serving, choose a Divine Domain that is ap 
propriate for it, and  if it doesn 't have a holy symbol, work 
with your DM to design one. 

The cleric's class  features often refer to your deity. If you 

are devoted to a pantheon, cosmic force, or philosophy, 
your cleric features still work for you as  written. Thi nk of 
the  references to a god as  references to the divine thing 
you  serve that gives you your magic.

DRUID 

EVEN  IN  DEATH,  EACH CREATURE PLAYS  ITS  PART IN 
maintainingthe Great Balance.  But now an imbalance 
grows,  a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is 
the destructive behavior of the mortal races.  The farther 
away from nature their actions take them, the more cor 
rupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly 
to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but 
there are times when we must rise up against danger and 
eradicate it.

A rattle made from  a  dried gourd and holly berries 
A miniature golden sickle handed down to you  by 
you r mentor 

GUIDING ASPECT 

Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the 
natural world, such as a  body of water, an animal, a  type 
of tree, or some other sort of plant. You  ide ntify with 
your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it 
sets an example  that you seek to e mulate. 

GUIDING  ASPECTS 

-Safhran , archdruid 

d6 

Druids are the caretakers  of the  natural world, and it is 
said  that in time a dru id  becomes the voice of nature, 
s pea king the truth that is too subtle  for the general pop 
ulace to hear. Many who become druids  find  that they 
natura lly gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and 
movements  fill  their minds and spirits with wonder and 
insight. Many sages and wise folk have stud ied nature, 
writing volumes about its  mystery and power, but druids 
are a special kind of being: at som e  point, they begin 
to embody these natural forces,  producing magical 
phenomena that lin k the m  to  the spirit of nature and 
the flow of life.  Because of their strange and mysterious 
power, druids are often revered, s hunned, or considered 
dange rous  by the people a round them. 

Your d ruid character might be a  true worsh iper of na 
ture, one who has a lways  scorned civi lization and found 
solace in  the wild. Or your character could  be a child of 
the city who now strives  to bring the civilized world  into 
harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections 
that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how 
your character came to the profession. 

TREASURED  ITEM 

Some druids  carry one or more items  that are sacred 
to them or have deep personal s ignificance. S uch  items 
are not necessarily  mag ical, but every one is  a n object 
whose mea ning connects the druid's mind and heart to 
a  profound concept or spiritual outlook. 

When you decide what your character's treasured 

item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you 
come by the ite m, and why is it important to you? 

Guidi ng Aspect 
Yew trees remind you of renewing your m ind and 
spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth. 
Oak trees  represent strength and vitality.  Medi 
tating under an oak fills  your body and  mind with 
resolve and fortitude. 
The river's endless flow  remi nds you of the great 
span of the world. You  seek to act with the long 
term interests of nature in  mind. 
The sea is a constant, churning cauldron of power 
and chaos. It reminds you that accepting change is 
necessary to sustain yourself in  the world. 
The birds in  the sky are evidence that even the 
smallest creatures can survive if they remain above 
the fray. 
As  demonstrated by the actions of the wolf,  an 
individual's strength is  nothing compared to the 
powet of the pack.

MENTOR 

It's  not unusual for would-be druids to s eek out (or be 
sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the 
basics of their magical arts. Most druids who lea rn from 
a  mentor begin their training at a young age, and the 
mentor has  a vital role in shaping a stude nt's attitudes 
a nd beliefs. 

If your character received training from someone 

else, who or what was that individual, and what was the 
nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you 
with a  particular outlook or otherwise influence your 
approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path? 

CHAPTER  I  f CHARACTER OPTIONS 

CIRCLE  OF DREAMS 

Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail 
from  regions  that have strong ties to the Feywild a nd 
its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardians hip of the 
natural world makes for a  natural alliance between 
them and good-aligned fey.  These druids seek to fill  the 
world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds 
and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they 
protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and 
reality blur together and where the weary can find  rest.

BALM  OF THE  SUMMER COURT 
At 2nd level, you become imbued with the  blessings of 
the Summer Court. You  are a font of energy that offers 
respite from injuries. You  have a  pool of fey energy rep 
resented by a number of d6s equal to your druid level. 
As a  bonus action, you can choose one creature you 
can see within  120 feet of you and spend a  number of 
those dice equal to half your druid leve l or less. Roll the 
spent dice and add them together. The target regains a 
number of hit points equal to the total. The target also 
gains 1  temporary hit point per die spent. 

You regain all expended dice when you finish a 

Jong rest. 

HEARTH  OF MOONLIGHT AND  SHADOW 
At  6th level, home can be w herever you are. During a 
s hort or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of 
the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the 
start of the rest, you touch a  point in space, and an invis 
ible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered 
on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. 

While within the sphere, you and your a llies gain a +5 

bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) 
checks, and any light from open Hames in the sphere (a 
campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it. 

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you 

leave the sphere.

Your mentor was a wise treant who taught you to 
think in  terms of years and decades rather than 
days or months. 
You  were tutored by a dryad who watched over 
a slumbering portal to the Abyss. During your 
training, you were tasked with watching for hidden 
threats to the world. 
Your tutor always interacted with you  in the form of 
a falcon. You  never saw the tutor's humanoid form. 
You  were one of several youngsters who were 
mentored by an old druid , until one of your fellow 
pupils  betrayed your group and killed your master. 
Your mentor has appeared to you  only in visions. 
You  have yet to meet this person, and you  are not 
sure such a  person exists  in  mortal form. 
Your mentor was a werebear who taught you  to 
treat all living things with equal regard . 

DRUID  CIRCLES 
At 2nd level, a druid gains the Druid Circle feature. The 
following options are available to a druid, in addition 
to  those offered in  the Player's Handbook: the Circle of 
Dreams and the Circle of the Shepherd. 

HIDDEN  PATHS 
Starting at 10th level, you can use the hidden, magical 
pathways that some fey  use to traverse space in the 
blink of an eye. As a  bonus action o n your turn, you can 
teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can 
see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport

WALKER IN  D REAMS 
At 14th level, the magic of the  Feywild grants you 
the a bility to travel me nta lly o r phys ically through 
dreamlands. 

W he n you finis h a  s hort rest, you ca n cast one of the 

following spells, without expending a  spell  s lot or re 
quiring mate ria l compo ne nts: dream  (with you as the 
messenge r), scrying, or te/eportation circle. 

T his  use  of teleportation circle is specia l.  Ra ther tha n

Once you use this feature, you ca n't use  it again 

until you finis h a  long rest. 

CIRCLE  O F  THE  SHEPHERD 

Druids  of the Circle of th e Shepherd commune 
with the spirits of nature, especially the s pirits 
of beasts  a nd the fey, and call to  those s p irits  for 
aid . These druids  recognize tha t all living things 
play a  role  in  the  natura l world, yet t hey foc us o n

Members of this circle  become  adventurers to oppose

You learn to s peak, read, a nd write Sylvan. In addi

the  a bility to deciphe r their noises a nd motions. Most

as you wou ld  with a ny nonplayer character. 

SPIRIT TOTEM 
Starting at 2nd level, you can call fo rth nature spirits  to 
influe nce the  world around you. As a  bonus  action, you 
can magica lly s ummon a n incorporeal spirit to a  point 
you can see within 60 fee t of you. The spirit c reates  a n 
aura in a  30 -foot radius a round that point. It counts as 
neither a  c reature nor an object, though it has the spec 
tra l a ppea rance of the c reature  it re p resents. 

As a  bonus actio n, you can  move  the s pirit up to 60 

feet to a  point you can see. 

The s pirit pe rsists  for 1 minute o r until you're  incapac 

itated. Once you use this  fea ture , you can't use  it again 
until you finish  a s hort or long rest. 

The effect of.the s pirit's a ura depe nds  on the  type of 

spirit you summon from the  options below. 

Bear Spirit. T he  bear s pirit g rants you and your allies 

its  might a nd e ndura nce. Each creature of your choice 
in  the a ura  when t he  spirit a ppears gains  temporary 
hit points equal to 5 +your druid level. In addition, you 
a nd your allies gain advantage on Strength c hecks and 
Strength saving throws while in the  a ura. 

Hawk Spirit. The hawk s pirit is a  consummate 
hunter, aiding you and your allies with  its  keen sight. 
Whe n a c reature  makes a n attack r oll  against a  target 
in the  spirit's a ura, you cao  use your reaction to grant 
advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your 
a !Ues have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) c hecks 
w hile  in the aura. 

CHAPTER  l  I CHARACTER OPTlONS 

Unicorn Spirit. The unicorn spirit lends its protection 

to those nearby. You and your a llies gain advantage on 
all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's 
aura. In addition, if you cast a spell  using a spell slot 
that restores hjt points to any creature inside or outside 
the aura, each  creature of your choice  in  the aura also 
regains hit points equal to your druid level. 

MIGHTY SUMMONER 
Starting at 6th level, beasts and fey  that you conjure are 
more resilient than normal. Any beast or fey summoned 
or created by a spell that you cast gains the follow-
ing benefits: 

The creature appears with more hit points than nor 
mal: 2 extra hit points per Hit Die it  has. 

•  The damage from its  natural weapons is considered 

magical for the purpose of overcoming immuruty a nd 
resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage. 

GUARDIAN SPIRIT 
Beginning at 10th level, your Spirit Totem safeguards 
the beasts and fey  that you call  forth with your magic. 
When a beast or fey that you summoned or created with 
a spell  ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura, that crea 
ture regains a  numbe r of hit points equal to half your 
druid level. 

FAITHFUL SUMMONS 
Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune 
with protect you when you are the most defenseless. 
If you a re reduced to  0 hit points or are incapacitated 
against you r will , you can immediately gain the benefits 
of conjure animals as if it were cast using a 9th-level 
spell s lot. It summons four beasts of your cho ice that are 
challenge rating 2 or lower. The conjured beasts appear 
within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from 
you,  they protect you from harm a nd attack your foes. 
The spell lasts for 1  hour, requiring no concentration, or 
until you dismiss it (no action required). 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 

you finish a long rest. 

LEARNING BEAST SHAPES 
The Wild Shape feature in the Player's Handbook lets 
you transform into a  beast that you've seen. That rule 
gives you a  tremendous amount of flexibility, making it 
easy to amass an array of beast form options for your 
self, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast 
Shapes table in that book. 

When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you 

might wonder which beasts you've a lready seen. The 
following tables organize beasts from the Monster Man 
ual according to the beasts' most likely environments. 
Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then 
consult the appropriate table for a list of an imals that 
your druid has probably seen by 2nd level. 

These tables can also help you and your DM deter 

mine which animals you might see on your travels. 
In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge 
rating and note whether a  beast has a  flyi ng or swim 
ming s peed. This information will help you determine 
whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.

CHAPTER 1  I CHARACTER  OPTIONS 

FIGHTER 

LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ALL DONE TALKING. 

-Tordek 

Of all the adventurers  in the worlds of D&D, the fighter 
is perh aps the greatest paradox. On the one ha nd, a s in 
gular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their 
cr aft in quite the same way;  their weapons, armor, and 
tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand , 
regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the 
heart of every fighter's  motivation lies the same basic 
truth: it is better to wound than to  be wounded. 

Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives 
fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily con 
cerned with the welfare of others. They put more value 
on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group 
than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the off 
ing, the true reward for most fighters comes from send 
ing enemies to their doom. 

The sections  below offer ways to add a little depth a nd 

a few personal touches to your fighter character. 

HERALDIC  SIGN -------
Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on 
behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others 
quest only for personal glory. In either case, a  fighter 
often displays a  heraldic s ign that represents that cause, 
either adopting the symbol of a nation or a  royal line, or 
creating a crest to represent one's  self-interest. 

Your character could be affiliated with a n organization 
or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner 
of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a 
heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature 
or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.

INSTRUCTOR 
Some fighters a re  natural-born combatants who have 
a  talent for surviving in  battle. Others learned the ba 
s ics of their combat prowess in their formative years 
from spending time in a  military or some other martial 
organization, when they were taught by the leaders of 
the group. 

A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those 

who received one-on-one instruction from an accom 
plished veteran of the cra ft. That instructor was, or 
perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat 
that relates to the student's background. 

If you decide that your character had an individual 

instructor, what is that person's specialty? Do you 
emulate your instructor in how you fight, or did you 
take the instructor's teachings and adapt them to your 
own purposes?

Instructor 
Gladiator. Your instructor was a slave who fought 
for freedom in  the arena, or one who willingly 
chose the gladiator's life to earn money and fame.

diers and knows much about working as a team. 
City Watch. Crowd control and peacekeeping are 
your instructor's specialties. 
Tribal Warrior. Your instructor grew up in a  tribe, 
where fighting for one's life was practically an 
everyday occurrence. 
Street Fighter. You r trainer excels at urban combat, 
combining close-quarters work with silence and 
efficiency. 
Weapon  Master. Your mentor helped you to be 
come one with your chosen weapon, by  imparting 
highly specialized knowledge of how to wield it 
most effectively.

SIGNATURE STYLE 

Many fighters  dis tinguish themselves from their peers 
by ado pting and perfectin g a  par ticula r style or method 
of wagi ng combat. Although th is style  migh t be a  natural 
outg rowth of a fighter's personality, that's not a lways the 
case- someone's approach to the world in general does 
not necessarily dictate how that person operates w hen 
lives a re on the li ne. 

Do you  have a com bat style  that mirrors your outlook 
on  life, or is somethi ng else inside you unleashed whe n

MARTIAL ARCHETYPES 
At 3rd level, a fighter gains  the Ma rtia l Archetype fea

addition  to  those offered in  the Player's Handbook : the 
Arcane Archer, the Cavalier, and the S a mura i. 

ARCANE ARCHER 

An Arcane Archer s tudies a  unique elven method of 
a rchery that weaves magic into attacks  to produce s u 
pern atural effects. Arcane Archers  are some of the  most 
elite wa rrio rs a mong the elves. They stand watch over 
the fringes of elven  dom ains, keeping a keen eye out fo r 
trespassers  and us ing m agic-infused a rrows to defeat 
monsters a nd invade rs  before  they can reach elven set 
tle ments . Over the centuries, the  methods  of these elf 
a rchers have been learned by members of other races 
w ho can a ls o ba lance arcane aptitude w ith a rche ry.

A RCANE A RCH ER  LOR E 
At 3 rd  level, you learn magical theory o r some of the 
secrets of nature-typical fo r practitioners of this e lven 
martia l tradition. Yo u choose to gain proficie ncy in ei 
ther the Arcana or the  Nature skill, and you choose to 
learn either the prestidigitation o r the druidcra ft cantrip. 

A RCANE SHOT 
At 3rd level, you learn to unleash s pecia l magical effects 
with some of your shots. W hen you gain this  feature , you 
learn two Arcane S hot options of your choice (see "Ar 
cane S hot Options" below). 

Once per turn when you fire a magic a rrow from a 
shortbow or lo ngbow as pa rt of the Attack action, you 
can a pply o ne of your Arcane S hot options  to that a r 
row. Yo u decide to use the optio n when the a rrow hits 
a creatu re, unless the option doesn't involve a n attack 
roll. You  have two uses of this  ability, and you regain all 
expended uses of it w hen you fi nish a s hort or lo ng rest. 
You gain an additiona l Arcane Shot option of your 
choice w hen you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 
10th, 15th, a nd 18th level. Each option a lso improves 
when you become an  18 th-level fig hter. 

M AGIC AR ROW 
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows  with 
magic. Whenever you  fire a  nonmagical a rrow fro m a 
s hortbow or longbow, you ca n ma ke it magical for the 
pur pose of overcoming r esistance and immunity to  non 
magical attacks a nd da mage. T he  magic fades from the 
a r row immediately after it hits  or m isses its target. 

CU RVING  SHOT 
At 7th level, you learn how to direct a n erra nt arrow 
toward a  new ta rget.  When you ma ke a n attack roll with 
a  magic ar row a nd  miss, you can use a  bonus action to 
r eroll the a ttack roll  aga ins t a differe nt target within 6 0 
feet of the origina l ta rget. 

E V ER-RE A DY  S H OT 
S ta rting at 15th level, your magica l a rchery is ava ilable

gence mod ifie r. 

LEF T  TO  R 1GH T :  Si\MURi\I,  Ci\Vi\LIER,  i\ND  ARCANE  ARCHER 

Banishing Arrow. You use abjura tion m agic to try to 

temporarily b a nish your ta rget to a h armless location 
in the  Feywild. The c r eature  hit by the arrow mus t a lso 
su cceed o n a  Ch arism a saving throw or be  banis h ed . 
W hile  ba nis hed  in  this  way,  the ta rget's speed  is  0 , and 
it is  incapacitated . At t he  e nd of its  next turn, the  ta rge t 
reappears in the s pace it vacated or in the nearest unoc 
cupied s pace if that s pace is occupied. 

After you reach  18th level in this  class, a  target also 

ta k es 2d6 force d a mage when t he  a rrow hits  it. 

Beguiling Arrow. Your e n ch a nt me nt magic causes 
this a rrow to  tempora rily beguile  its target. The c reature 
hit by the a rrow  takes a n extra  2d6 psychic  damage, a nd 
c hoose one  of you r aJJies within 3 0  feet o f the  target. 
The  targe t must s ucceed on a  Wis dom saving throw, or 
it is c ha rm ed by the c h osen ally until the start of your 
next turn. This effect e nds  early if the c hosen a lly at 
tacks  the c h a rmed  target, deals  da mage to it, or forces it 
to m a k e a saving throw. 

The psychic d amage inc reases to 4d6 w hen you reach 

18th level in this class. 

Bursting Arrow. You  imbue your arrow with force 
e n e rgy drawn from the  school of evocation. The  e ne r gy 
de ton a tes  a fte r your attack. Immedi ately after the  a r 
row hits the c reature, the  targe t and  all other c reatures 
within 10 feet of it ta ke  2d6 force da mage each. 

The force damage inc reases to 4d6 when you reach 

18th level in  this  class. 

Enfeebling Arrow. You weave necromantic  magic into 
your arrow. The c reature  hit by the  a rrow ta kes a n extra 
2d6 necrotic damage. The  target mus t a lso s ucceed 

o n a  Cons titution saving throw, or  the  da m age dealt 
by its  weapon attack s  is  ha lved until the start of your 
next turn. 

The  necrotic d a mage incr eases to 4d6 whe n you reach 

18th level in  this class. 

Grasping Arrow. Whe n  this  arrow s trikes its  ta rge t, 

conjuration  magic creates grasping, poisonous bram  
bles, which wrap a round the  ta rget. T he  creature  hit by 
th e  arrow takes an extra 2d6 po ison  da mage, its  s peed 
is  reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 s las hfog dam 
age the fi rst time  on each turn it moves 1 foot or  more 
without tele p orting. T he  targe t or a ny c r eature tha t can 
reach it ca n use its action to  re move  the  brambles with 
a s uccessful S tre ngth (Athle tics) c heck against your Ar

minute  or until you use  this  option again. 

The poison d amage and s las hing damage both in 
c rease to 4d6 ~hen you reach  18th level in this class. 
Piercing Arrow. You  use transmutation m agic  to 
give your a rrow  a n e the real qu a lity. Whe n you use this 
option, you don't m ake an attack roll for the  a ttack. 
Ins tead, the arrow s hoots forward in  a line, which  is  1 
foot wide and 3 0  feet long, before disappearing. The 
arrow passes ha rmlessly through objects, ignoring 
cover.  E ach creature in tha t line  must make  a D exte r ity 
saving throw. On a  failed save, a  c reature  takes dam a ge 
as if it were hit by the  a rrow, plus a n extra  ld6 pie rcing 
d a mage. On a successful save, a  target takes h a lf as 
muc h damage. 

The  pie rcing da m age increases to 2d6 when you reach 

18th level in this class. 

CHAPTE R  l  I CHARACTER OPTI ONS 

CAVALIERS,  SAMURAI ,  AND  HISTORY 
While both cavaliers and samurai existed  in  the real world, 
our inspirations for  both fighter archetypes are taken from 
popular culture  (folk tales, movies,  and comic books),  not 
from  history. Our intent is to capture the cinematic, heroic 
element of both archetypes in the game, rather than create 
an accurate historica l represen tation of either one. 

UNWAVERING  MARK 
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling 
their attacks and punishing them for harming others . 
When you hit a creature w ith a  melee weapon attack, 
you can mark the creature  until the end of your next 
turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or 
you die, or if someone else marks the creature. 

While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by 

you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't 
target you. 

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage 
to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee 
weapon attack aga inst the marked creature as a  bonus 
action on your next turn. You  have advantage on the 
attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's  weapon deals extra 
damage to the target equa l to half you r fighter level. 

Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you 
can make this special attack a  number of times equal to 
your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you re 
gain all expended uses of it when you finish a  long rest. 

WARDING MANEUVER 
At 7th level, you learn to fend  off strikes directed at 
you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or 
a creature you can see within 5  feet of you is hit by an 
attack, you can roll  1d8 as a  reaction if you're wielding 
a  melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the 
number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If 
the attack still  hits, the target has resistance against the 
attack's  damage. 

You can use this feature a  number of times equal 
to your Constitution modifier (m inimum of once), and 
you regain a ll expended uses of it w hen you finish a 
long rest. 

HOLD THE LINE 
At 10th level, you become a  master of locking down 
you r enemies. Creatu res provoke an opportun ity attack 
from you when they move 5  feet or more whi le within 
your reach, and if you hit a creature with a n opportunity 
attack, the target's speed is  reduced to 0  until the end of 
the current turn. 

Seeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant 
your arrow the ability to seek out a  target. When you use 
this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. 
Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past 
minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving 
around corners  if necessary and ignoring three-quarters 
cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's 
range and there is a  path large enough for the arrow to 
travel to the target, the target must make a  Dexterity 
saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after 
traveling as far as it can. On a  failed save, the target 
takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 
1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current 
location. On a successful save, the target takes half as 
much damage, and you don't learn its location. 

The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 

18th level in this class. 

Shadow Arrow. You  weave illusion magic into your 
arrow, causing it to occlude you r foe's vision with shad 
ows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 
psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom 
saving throw o r be unable  to see anything farther than 5 
feet away until the start of your next turn. 

The  psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 

18th level in this class. 

CAVALIER 
The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. 
Usua lly born among the nobility and raised at court, a 
Cavalier is equally at home leading a  cavalry charge or 
exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also 
learn how to guard those in their charge from  harm, 
often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of 
the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, 
many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to em 
bark on g lorious adventure.

BORN TO THE SADDLE 
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a  rider becomes 
apparent. You  have advantage on saving throws made 
to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount 
and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your 
feet if you'r e not incapacitated. 

Finally, mounting or d ismounti ng a creature costs you 

only 5 feet of movement, rather than ha lf your speed.

S TRENGTH BEFOR E  D EATH 
Sta rting at 18 th leve l, your fi ghting spirit can delay the

0  hit points a nd doesn't kill you outright, you can use 
your reaction to delay fa lling unconscious, a nd you can 
immediately take a n extra  turn, interrupting the current 
turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, 
taking da mage causes death saving th row failures as 
norma l, a nd three death saving throw failures can s till 
kill yo u. When  the extra  turn ends, yo u fa ll  unconscious

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until

MONASTIC  ICON 

-Ember, grand master of flowers 

Monks walk a  path of contradiction. They study their art 
as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor 
and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are dead ly com 
batants, their abilities on a  par with those of a  raging 
ba rba rian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace 
th is seeming contradiction , for it s peaks to the core of 
all monastic study. By coming to know oneself com 
pletely, one learns much of the wider world. 

A monk's focus on inner mas tery leads  many such 
individua ls to become detached from society,  more con 
cerned with their personal experience tha n with hap 
penings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed 
of an a lready rare type of character, taking their quest 
for perfection beyond the walls  of the monastery into the 
world at large. 

Playing a  monk character offers many intriguing op 
portunities to try something diffe rent. To distinguis h 
your monk cha racter even  further, consider the o ptions 
in the sections that follow. 

MONASTERY 

A monk studies in a monastery in pre paration for a  life 
of asceticism. Mos t of those w ho enter a m onastery 
make it their home for the  rest of their lives, wit h the 
exception of adventurers and others who have reason to 
leave. For those individuals, a  monastery might serve as 
a  refuge between excursions  to the world or as a source 
of s upport in  times of need. 

What sort of place was your monastery, a nd where is 
it located? Did attending it contr ibute  to your experience 
in an unus ual or distinctive way? 

CHAPTER 1  I CHARACTER OPTIONS 

Even in the monastic lifestyle , which eschews materi 
a lis m a nd personal possessions, symbolis m plays an 
important part in defining the  identity of a n order. Some 
monastic orders treat certain creatures w ith s pecial 
regard, either because the creature  is tied to the order's 
histo ry or because it serves as an example of a quality 
the  monks seek to emulate. 

If your cha racter's monastery had a s pecial icon, you 
might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere 
inconspicuous  on your clothing to serve as an identify 
ing mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not have a 
physical fo rm but is expressed through a gesture or a 
posture that you adopt, and which other monks  might 
know how to interpret.

M O NASTIC  T RA D ITIO NS 
At 3rd level, a monk gains  the Monastic Tradition fea 
ture. The following options are available  to a  monk, in 
addition to those offered in the Player's Handbook: the 
Way of the Drunken Master, the Way of the Kensei, and 
the Way of the Sun Soul. 

WAY OF THE  DRUNKEN MASTER 

The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students 
to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of 
a drunka rd. A drunke n master sways, tottering on 
uns teady feet, to present what seems  like an incompe 
te nt combata nt who proves frus tra ting to engage. The 
drunken mas te r's erratic s tumbles conceal a carefully 
executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, 
a nd retreats. 

A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to 
bring gladness to the despondent or to de monstrate 
humility to the a rrogant, but when battle is joined, the 
drunken  master can be a  maddening, mas terful foe.

WAY OF THE KENSEI 
Monks  of the Way of the Kensei tra in relentlessly with 
the ir weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes 
an extens ion of the body. Founded on a mas tery of 
sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include 
m any differe nt weapons. 

A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a cal 
ligraphe r or painter rega rds a pen or brush. Whatever 
the weapon, the ke nsei views  it as a tool used  to express 
the beauty a nd precis ion of the martia l arts. That s uch 
mastery makes a  kensei a  peerless warrior is  but a side 
effect of intense devotion , practice, a nd s tudy.

you a ren't incapacitated.

SYMBOL 
Paladins are mindful of the influence of symbols, and 
many of them adopt or design an artistic device that 
bears a distinctive image. Your symbol exemplifies the 
oath you have taken and com municates that message to 
those around you, friend and foe al ike. 

Your symbol might be displayed on a  banner, a flag, or 

your cloth ing for a ll  to see. Or it could be less obvious, 
s uch as a trinket or a  token that you carry concealed on 
your person.

A black heart, signifying that emotions such as pity

An unblin king eye,  meaning that you  are ever alert

NEMESIS 
Their adherence to a sacred oath demands that paladins 
take an active stance in carrying their beliefs into the 
world. This activity naturally leads to conflict with crea 
tures or entities that oppose those beliefs. Among those 
opponents, one often stands out as a  paladin's most per 
sistent or most form idable foe- a  nemesis whose pres 
ence or influence is  a constant factor in a paladin's life. 

PALADIN 

THE TRUE WORTH  OF A  PALADIN I S MEASURED NOT IN 
foes defeated or dungeons plundered.  It is measured in lives 
saved and hearts turned to the causes of mercy and justice. 
- ls teval 

A paladin is a  living e mbodiment of an oath-a promise 
or a vow made manifest in the person of a  holy warrior 
who has the skill  and the determination to see the cause 
through to the end. Some paladins devote  themselves 
expressly to protecting the innocent and spreading jus 
tice in  the world, while others resolve to attain that goal 
by conquering those who stand de fiant and bringing 
them under the ru le  of law. 

Although no paladin in the world could be described 

as typical,  a number of them are narrow-minded 
do-gooders who refuse to tolerate even the smallest 
deviation from their own outlook. Paladins who take 
up the adventuring life, however, rarely remai n so rigid 
in their attitudes-if only to keep from alienating their 
companions. 

You  can flesh out your paladin character by using the 

suggestions below. It's important to keep in mind that 
most paladins aren't robots. They have doubts and prej 
udices and harbor contradictory thoughts just as any 
other character does. Some are compelled by an inter 
nal motivation that might sometimes be at odds with the 
principles of their oaths. 

PERSONAL GOAL 
The precepts of a  paladin's oath  provide purpose  to the 
character and dictate an ultimate goal or an overall in 
tent that the paladin abides by and advances. Aside from 
that, some paladins are driven by a  personal goa l that 
either complements or transcends the dictates of their 
oaths. Paladins who swea r different oaths m ight have 
the same personal goal, differing only in  how they apply 
that goal to their actions when upholding their oaths. 

If your paladin character has a  personal goal, it might 
be drawn from some life event and thus not directly tied 
to the oath. 

CHAPTER  l  I CHARACTER  OPTTONS 

Your paladin character might have an enemy that 

dates from the days before you took up your path. Or you 
could be a  target because when you became a  paladin, 
you immediately attracted the attention of those that 
wou ld do you in. If you have a  nemesis, who or what is 
it? Whom among your enemies do you consider to  be the 
biggest threat to ach ieving your goals?

A rival  paladin who trained with you but became an

TEMPTATION 

Although paladins are dedicated to their oaths, they are 
mortals, and thus they are flawed.  Many of them exhibit 
a  type of behavior or hold to an attitude that is not in 
keeping with the highest ideals of their calling. 

What is the temptation that your character succumbs 

to o r finds it difficult to resist?

Temptation 
Fury. When your anger is  roused, you  have trouble 
thinking straight, and you  fear you  might do some 
thing you'll  regret. 
Pride. Your deeds are noteworthy, and no one takes 
note of them more often than you. 
Lust. You  can't resist an attractive face and a  pleas 
ant smile. 
Envy. You  are mindful of what some famous folk 
have accomplished, and you feel  inadequate when 
your deeds don't compare to theirs. 
Despair. You consider the great stre ngth of the 
enemies you  must defeat, and at times you see no 
way to achieve final  victory. 
Greed . Regardless of how much glory and treasure 
you amass, it's never enough for you. 

SACRED  OATHS 
At 3rd level, a  paladin gains  the Sacred Oath feature. 
The following options are available  to a paladin, in addi 
tion to  those offered in the Player's Handbook: the Oath 
of Conquest a nd the Oath of Redemption. 

PALl\OIN OF CoNQ.uE s T 

OATH  OF  CONQU_E_S_T ___  _ 

The Oath of Conquest calls  to paladins who seek glory 
in  battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't 
enough for these paladins to establish order. They must 
crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight ty 
rants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather 
into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war 
and well-ordered might. 

Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with 
the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law 
over the balm of mercy. The arcbdevil Bel, warlord of 
Avernus, counts many of these paladins- called hell 
knights- as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights 
cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen en 
emies, a grim-warning to any w ho dare oppose them 
and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often 
most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, 
who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far 
into darkness. 

TENETS OF  CONQUEST 
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest 
seared on the upper arm. 

Douse the Flame of Hope. It is  not enough to merely 
defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so over 
whelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered 
forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire. 
Rule with an  Iron Fist. Once you have conquered, 
tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it 

CHAPTER  I  I CHARACTER OPTIONS 

AURA  OF  CONQUEST 
Starting at 7th level, you constantly em anate a  menacing 
aura w hile you're  not incapacitated. The aura extends 
10 feet from you in every direction, but not through 
total cover. 

If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is  reduced 
to 0 while in the aura, and that creature  takes psychic 
damage equa l to ha lf your paladin level if it starts  its 
turn there. 

At 18th level, the  ra nge of this aura increases 

to 30 feet. 

SCORNFUL REBUKE 
Starting at 15th level, those w ho dare to strike you a re 
psychically punished for their aud acity. Whenever a 
creature  hits you with an attack, that creature  takes 
psychic damage equa l to your Charisma  modifier (mini 
mum of 1) if you're  not incapacitated. 

INVINCIBLE  CONQUEROR 
At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordi 
nary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically 
become a n avatar of conquest, gaining the following 
benefits for 1 minute: 

You  have resistance to a ll  damage. 

•  When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can 

make one additiona l attack as part of that action. 
•  Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a 

roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. 

O nce you use this  fea ture, you can't use it again until 
you finis h a long rest. 

OATH  OF R E DEMPTI ON 

The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult 
path, one that requires a  holy wa rrior to use violence 
only as a last resort. P aladins who dedicate themselves 
to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed 
and that the path of benevolence a nd justice is  one that 
anyone can walk. These pa ladins face evil creatures in 
the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they s lay 
their enemies only w hen s uch a deed will clearly save 
other lives. Paladins w ho follow this path are  known as 
redeemers. 

While redeemers are idealists, they a re no fools. Re 
deemers know that undead, demons, devils , and other 
supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against 
s uch foes,  paladins w ho swear this oath  bring the full 
w rath of their weapons  a nd s pells to bear. Yet the  re 
deemers s till pray that, one day, even cr eatures  of wick 
ed ness will  invite their own redemption. 

TENETS  OF  REDEMPTION 
The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a 
high standard of peace a nd justice. 

Peace. Violence is a weapon of last resort.  Diplomacy 

and unders tanding ar e  the path s  to long-lasting peace. 
Innocen ce. All people begin life  in a n innocent state, 

and it is their environment or the influence of dark 
forces that drives them to evil.  By setting the proper 
example, a nd working to heal the wounds of a  deeply 
flawed world, you can set anyone o n a  righteous path. 

s hall be favored. Those who defy it s ha ll  be punished as 
an example to all  who might follow. 

Strength Above All. You  shall rule  until a stronger 
one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the 
challenge, or fall to you r own ruin.

the  roll, but before  the DM says whether the attack hits 
or misses.

Patience. Change takes time. Those who have walked 
the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep 
them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of 
righteousness in a creature, you  must work day after day 
to a llow that seed to survive and flouris h. 

Wisdom. Your heart a nd  mind must stay clear, for

Rebuke the Violent. You can  use your Channel Divin 
ity to rebuke t hose who use violence. Immediately after 
an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an 
attack against a creature other than you , you can use 
your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant 
damage equal to the damage  it just dealt. On a success 
ful  save, it takes half as much damage. 

PALADIN  OF 

REDEMPTION 

AURA OF THE  GUARDIAN 
Starting at 7th level, you can shield others  from harm at 
the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 
feet of you  takes damage, you can use your reaction to 
magically take that damage, instead of that creature tak 
ing it. This featu re doesn't tr ansfer any other effects that 
might accompa ny  the da mage, a nd t his  damage can't be 
reduced in any way. 

At  18th level, the range of this aura increases 

to 30 feet. 

PROTECTIVE SPIRIT 
Starting at 15th level, a  holy presence mends your 
wounds in battle. You  regain hit points equal to  ld6 + 
half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat 
w ith fewer than half of your hit points remaining and 
you aren't incapacitated. 

EMISSARY OF REDEMPTION 
At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which 
gives you two benefits: 
•  You  have resistance to a ll  damage dealt by othe r crea 

tures (their attacks, spells , and  other effects). 

•  Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes 
radia nt damage equal to half the damage you  take 
from the attack. 

If you attack a creatu re, cast a spell on it, or dea l dam 
age to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit 
works against that creature until you finish a  long rest.

RANGER 

I  SPEND A LOT OF MY LIFE AWAY  FROM CfVl LIZATION, 
keeping to its fringes to protect it. Don't assume that be 
cause I don't bend th e knee to your king that I haven't done 
more to protect him than all his knights put together. 

-Soveliss 

Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who 
patrol the edges of civilized territory, turning back the 
denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is  a thankless job, 
si nce their efforts are rarely understood and almost 
never rewarded. Yet  rangers pers ist in their duties, 
never doubting that their work makes the world a 
safer place. 

A relationship with civilization informs  every ra nger's 

persona lity and his tory. Some rangers see themselves 
as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civili 
zation's frontier, a ns wering to no sovereign power. Oth 
ers are s urvivalists who eschew civilization a ltogether. 
They vanquis h monsters to  keep themselves safe while 
they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of 
the world. If their efforts also benefit the kingdoms a nd 
other civi lized realms  that they avoid, so be it. 

If you're creating or playing a  ranger character, the 
following sections offer ideas for embellis hing the char 
acter and enhancing your roleplaying experience. 

VIEW OF THE WORLD 

A ranger's view of the world begins (and s ometimes 
ends) with that character's outlook toward civilized folk 
and the places they occupy. Some range rs have a n atti 
tude toward civilization that's deeply rooted in dis da in, 
while others pity the people they have sworn to pro 
tect- though on the battlefield, it's impossible to tell  the 
difference between one  ranger and another. Indeed, to 
those who have seen them operate and been the be nefi 
ciaries of thei r prowess, it scarcely matters why rangers 
do what they do. That said, no two rangers  are likely to 
express their opinio ns  on any m atter in the same way. 
If you haven't yet thought about the details of your 
character 's worldview, consider putting a finer point on 
things by s ummarizing that viewpoint in a s ho rt s tate 
me nt (s uch as the entries on the following table). How 
might that feeling affect the way you conduct yourself?

Towns and cities are the best places for those who 
can't survive on their own. 
The advancement of civilization is the best way to 
t hwart chaos, but its reach must be monitored. 
Towns and cities are a necessary evil,  but once the 
wilderness is purged of supernatura l threats , we 
will  need them no more. 
Walls  are fo r cowards, who huddle behind them 
while others do the work of making the world  safe. 
Visiting a town  is  not unpleasant, but after a few 
days  I fee l the irresistible call to return to the wild. 
Cities breed weakn ess by isolating folk  from the 
harsh lessons of the wild. 

HOMELAND 

All  rangers, regardless of how they came to take up 
the profession, have a strong connection to the natural 
world and its various  terrains. For some rangers, the 
wilderness  is where they g rew up, either as a  result of 
being born there or moving there at a young age. For 
other ra ngers, civilization was originally hom e, but the 
wilderness became a second homeland. 

Think of your character's backstory a nd decide what 
terrain feels most like home, whether or not you were 
born there. What does that terrain say about your per 
sona lity? Does it influence which spells you choose to 
learn? Have your experie nces there s haped who you r 
favored enemies a re?

the challenges of combating its denizens. 
You  dwelled on the edge of a swamp, in an area im 
periled by land creatures as well as aquatic ones. 
Because yo u grew up among the peaks, finding the

You wandered the far north , learning how to pro

HUNTER' S  SENSE 
At 3 rd level, you gain t he abi lity to peer at a creature 
a nd  magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, 
choose one creature you can see with in 60 feet o f you. 
You  immediately lea rn whether the creature  has any 
da mage immunities, resista nces, or vulnerabilities and 
what they a re. If the creature is hidden from divination 
magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, re 
sistances, or vulnerabilities. 

You  can use this feature a  nu mber of times equa l to 
your Wisdom modifier (m inimum of once). You regain all 
expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 

SLAYER'S  P REY 
Starting at 3 rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, 
increasing the  harm you inflict on it. As a  bonus  action, 
you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of 
you as the ta rget of this feature. The first time each  turn 
that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an 
ex tra  1d6 damage from  the weapon.

ends  ea rly if you designate a di ffe rent creature. 

SUPERNATURAL DEFENSE 
At 7th level, you gain extra  resilience against your p rey's 
assau lts on your mind a nd body. Whenever the  target 
of your S layer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw 
a nd whenever you make an abi lity check to escape that 
ta rget's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll. 

MAGIC-USER'S  NEMESIS 
At 11th level, you gain the abil ity to thwart someone 
else's magic. ~hen you see a creature casting a spell or 
teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reac 
tion to try to magica lly foil  it. The creature  must succeed 
on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, 
or its s pe ll or teleport fails and  is  wasted. 

Once you use this  feature, you can't use it again until 

you finish a s hort or long rest. 

SLAYER' S  COUNTER 
At  15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when 
your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slay 
er's  Prey fo rces you to make a saving throw, you can use 
your reaction to make one weapon attack against the 
quarry. You make this attack immediately before making 
the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automati 
cally s ucceeds, in add ition  to the attack's normal effects.

ADVERSARY 
Natura lly, those who enfo rce t he  law a re bound to come 
up against those who break it, and  it's the ra re rogue 
who is n't feat ured on at least o ne wa nted  poster. Beyond 
that, it's in  the nature of their profession  that rogues 
often come  into contact w ith criminal elements, whether 
out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be 
adversa ries too, a nd t hey're  li kely to be ha rder to deaJ 
w ith tha n t he average member of the city watch. 

If yo ur cha racter 's backstory doesn't a lready include a 
personage of this sort, you could work w ith your DM to 
come up with a  reason why an adversa ry has appeared 
in your life. Perhaps you've been the s ubject of scrutiny 
for a while from someone who wa nts to use you fo r 
ne farious  purposes a nd has j ust now become k nown to 
you. S uch a n incident could be the  basis  for a n upcom

Does you r rogue character have an adversary w ho

BENEFACTOR 
Few rogues make it far in life before needing someone's 
help, which m eans  thereafter owi ng that benefactor a 
significa nt debt. 

If your cha racter 's backstory doesn't already include a 
personage of this sort, you could work with your OM to 
determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. 
Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor 
did for you without realizing who was responsibl e, and 
that person has now just become known to you. Who 
helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the 
time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?

ROGUISH ARCHETYPES 
At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Roguish Archetype fea

the Inquisitive, the Mastermind, the Scout, and the 
Swashbuckler. 

INQUISITIVE 
As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting o ut se 
crets a nd unraveling mysteries. You  rely on your sharp 
eye for detail, but a lso on your finely honed ability to 
read the words and deeds of other cr eatures to deter 
mine their true in tent. You excel at defeating creatures 
that  hide among and prey upon ordina ry folk, and your 
mastery of lore and you r  keen deductions make you well 
equipped to expose and end hidden evils.

REACTIO N 

When a new sorcerer enters the world, either at birth 
or later when one's power becomes evident, the con 
sequences of that event depend greatly on how its wit 
nesses react to what they have seen. 

When your sorcerer's powers appeared, how did the 
world around you respond? Were other people support 
ive, fearful, or somewhere in between? 

REACTIONS

service to your community. 
Your powers caused destruction and even a death 
when they became evident, and you were treated 
a s a criminal. 
Your neighbors hate and fear your power, causing 
them to shun you. 
You  came to the attention of a sinister cult that 
plans on exploiting your abi lities. 
People around you believe that your powers are a

SUPER NATURAL  MARK 

A sorcerer at rest is almost indistinguishable from a 
normal person;  it's only when their magic flies forth that 
sorcerers reveal their true nature. Even so, many sorcer 
ers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them 
apa rt from other folk. 

SORCE RER 

PRACTICE AND STUDY ARE FOR AMATEURS. TRUE POWER 

is a birthright. 

- Hennet, scion ofTiamat 

When it comes  to dr awing forth  their abilities in times 
of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other char 
acters. Their power not only rests within them, but it 
likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer 
is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic 
chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively 
learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have 
their power thrust upon them. 

Because the idea of an innately magical being trav 

eling among them does not sit well with many folk, 
sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and s uspicion in others 
they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed 
in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit 
their Jess magically gifted contemporaries. 

Sorcerers are often defined by the events s urroundjng 

the manifestation of their power. For those who receive 
it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause 
for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, 
banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying 
arrival of their abilities. 

Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarrung as it 
is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on 
how to flesh out and personalize your persona. 

ARCANE  ORIGIN 

Some sorcerers understand where their power came 
from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others 
can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a 
way that suggests no particular cause. 

Does your character know the source of your magi 
cal power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a 
cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't 
know where their power arose from, your DM can use 
this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when 
the information plays a  role in the campaign.

You wrinkle your nose repeated ly while you are 
chewing. 
A red splotch appears on your neck once a day, 
then vanishes after an hour. 

As the world well  knows , some sorcerers are better than 
others at controlling their s pellcasti ng. Sometimes a 
wild display of m agic gone awry emanates from a sor 
cerer who casts a spell. But even when o ne's magic goes 
off as planned, t he act of casting is often accompanied 

by a  telltale s ign that makes it clear w he re  t hat magical 
e nergy came from. 

When your sorcerer character casts a spell, does the 
effort reveal itself in a sign of sorcery? Is  this sign tied to 
your origin or some o ther aspect of who you are, or is it 
a seemingly random phenomenon?

SORCEROUS  ORIGINS 
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin fea 
ture. The following options a re available  to a sorcerer, 
in add ition to  those offered in  the Player's Handbook: 
D ivine Soul, Shadow Magic, a nd Storm Sorcery. 

DIVINE SOUL 

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer 
comes from a divine sou rce that glim mers within the 
soul. Having s uch a  blessed soul is a sign that your 
innate magic might come from a distant but powerful fa. 
milial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ances 
tor was an angel, tra nsformed into a  mortal and sent to 
fight in a god's name. Or your birth might align with a n 
ancient prophecy, marki ng you as a servant of the gods 
or a chosen vessel of divine magic. 

A Divine Soul, with a  natural magnetism, is seen as a 
threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who 
commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine 
a n existing order by claiming a direct tie to  the divine. 

In some cul tures, only those who can claim the power 

of a Divine Soul may command religious  power. In 
these lands, ecclesiastical positions a re dominated by a 
few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

In addition, choose an affi nity for the source of you r

wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and 
d ragonfly wings for neutrality. 

UNEARTHLY RECOVERY 
At  18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous 
injuries. As a  bonus action when you have  fewer than 
half of you r hi t points rema ining, you can regain a n um 
ber of hit points  equa l to  half your hit point maxim um. 
Once you  use this feature, you can't use it again until 

you finish a long rest. 

SHADOW MAGIC 

You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic 
comes from  the Shadowfell itself. You  might trace your 
lineage to a n entity from  that place, or perhaps you were 
exposed to its fell  energy and transformed by it. 

The power of s hadow magic casts a stra nge pall  over 

your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains 
you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against 
the dark energy that im bues your soul. At your option , 
you can pick from or roll  on the Shadow Sorcerer 
Quirks table  to create a quirk for your character.

EYES  OF THE DARK 
Starting at 1st level, you have darkvis ion with a  range 
of 120 feet. 

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn 
the darkness spell, which doesn't count against your 
number of sorcerer spells known. In  addition, you can 
cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a 
s pell s lot. U you cast it with sorcery points, you can see 
through the darkness created by the spell. 

STRENGTH OF THE  GRAVE 
Starting at 1st level, your existence in a  twilight state be 
tween life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When 
damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a 
Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On 
a success, you instead drop to  1 hit point. You can't use 
this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant 
damage or by a critical hit. 

After the saving throw succeeds, you can't use this 

feature again until you finish a long rest. 

HOUND OF ILL OMEN 
At 6th level, you gain  the ability to call  forth a  howling 
creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a  bonus 
action, you can s pend 3 sorcery points to magically 
s ummon a  hound of ill omen to target one creature you 
can see within 120  feet of you. The hound uses the dire 
wolf's statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C 
in the Player's Handbook), with the following changes: 

•  The hound is s ize Medium, not Large, and it counts  as 

a monstrosity, not a  beast. 

•  It appears with a  number of temporary hit points 

equal to  half your sorcerer level. 

•  It can move th rough other creatures and objects as 

if they were difficu lt terrain. The hound takes 5 force 
damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 

•  At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows 
its target's  loca tion. If the target was hidden, it is no 
longer hidden from the  hound. 

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your 
choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the 
hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by 
the most direct route, and it can use its action o nly to at 
tack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, 

but only against its  target. Add itionally, while the hound 
is within  5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage 
on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound 
disappears if it is reduced to 0  hit points, if its ta rget is 
reduced  to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes. 

SHADOW WALK 
At  14th level, you gain the ability to step from one 
shadow into another. When you are in dim light or dark 
ness, as a  bonus action , you can magically teleport up to 
120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also 
in dim light or darkness . 

UMBRALFORM 
Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points 
as a bonus  action to magically transform yourself into 
a shadowy form . In this form, you  have  resistance to 
all damage except force and radiant damage, and you 
can move  through other creatures and objects as if they 
were difficL1.lt terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end 
your turn inside an object. 

You remain in  this for m for  1 minute. It ends early if 
you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you dismiss it as a 
bonus action. 

STORM  SORCERY 

Your innate magic comes from  the power of elemental 
air. Many with th is  power can trace their magic back to 
a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but 
perhaps you were born during a  howling gale so power 
ful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might 
include the influence of potent air creatures such as 
djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm perme 
ates your being.

Starting at 1st level, you can use a  bonus action on your 
turn to cause whirling g us ts  of elemental air to briefly 
s urround you, immediately before or after you cast a 
s pell of 1st level or hig her. Doing so allows you to fly up 
to  10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. 

HEART OF THE STORM 
At 6th level, you gain resis tance to lig htning and thunder 
damage. In addition, whenever you s tart casting a spell 
of 1s t level or higher that deals  lightning or thunder

of you equal to 3 + your Charis ma  modifier. The chosen 
creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1

PATRON  ATTITUDES

Attitude 
Your patron has guided and helped your family for 
generations and is  kindly toward you. 
Each  interaction with your capricious patron is a 
surprise, whether pleasant or painful. 
Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who 
sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influ-

ence the world. 
Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you 
with a  measure of respect. 
Your patron tricked  you  into a  pact and treats you 
as a  slave. 
You  are mostly left to your own devices with  no in 
terference from your patron. Sometimes you  dread 
the demands it will  make when it does appear. 

SPECIAL TERMS  OF THE PACT 

A pact can range from  a loose agreement to a forma l 
contract with lengthy,  detailed clauses and lists of re 
quirements. The terms of a  pact- what a warlock must 
do to receive a  patron's  favor- are always dictated by 
the  patron. On occasion, those terms include a special 
proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks 
take these dictates as seriously as they do the other re 
quirements of their pacts. 

Does you r character have a pact that requires you 
to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly 
frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed 
s uch a duty on you a lready, that's not to say it couldn't 
still  happen.

Term 
When directed, you  must take immediate action

Your pact tests your willpower; you  are required to 
abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants. 
At least once a day, you  must inscribe o r carve your 
patron's name or symbol on the wall of a building. 
You  must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to 

maintain your pact. 
You  can  never wear the same outfit twice, since 
your patron finds  such  predictability to be boring. 
When you  use an eldritch invocatio n, you  must 
speak your patron's name aloud or risk incurring 

its displeasure . 

CHAPTER  I  I CHARACTER OPTIONS 

WARLOCK 
You THINK ME MAD? I THINK TRUE INSANITY I S BEING 

content to live a life of mortal drudge1y when knowledge 
and power is therefor the taking in the realm beyond. 

-Xarren, h erald of Acamar 

Wa rlocks a re finders and keepers of secrets. They push 
at the edge of our understanding of the world, always 
seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wiz 
a rds might heed a clear sign of danger and e nd their 
research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. 
Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curios 
ity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk 
would describe that combination as evidence of mad 
ness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery. 
Warlocks a re defined by two elements that work 
in concert to forge their path into this class. The first 
element is the event or circumstances that led to a 
warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The 
second one is the nature of the entity a  warlock is bound 
to. Unlike clerics, who typically e mbrace a deity a nd that 
god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, 
or vice versa. 

The sections that follow provide ways to embellis h a 
warlock character that could generate some intriguing 
story and roleplaying opportunities. 

P ATRON 'S ATTITUDE 

Every relationship is a  two-way street, but in the case of 
warlocks and their patrons it's not necessarily true that 
both sides of the street are the same width or made of 
the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their 
patron, whether positive or negative, might be recipro 
cated by the  patron, or the two participants in the pact 
might view one another with opposing emotions. 

When you determine the attitude your warlock charac 

ter holds towa rd your patron, also consider how things 
look from the patron's perspective. How does your pa 
tron behave  toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, 
or an enemy that grants you power only because you 
forced a  pact upon it? 

WARLOCK  OF 

THE  CELESTIAL 

BINDING MARK 

Some patrons make a  habit of, and often enjoy,  mark 
ing the warlocks under their sway io some fashion. A 
binding mark makes it clear-to those who know about 
such things- that the individual in question is bound to 
the  patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of 
such a  mark, claiming it as proof of one's  pact, or might 
want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the dif 
ficulties it might bring. 

If your warlock's pact comes with a  binding mark, 

how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the 
nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to 
you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are 
secr etly ashamed of? 

BINDING  MARKS

OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS 
At  1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron 
feature. The following options are available  to a warlock, 
in addition to those offered in  the Player's Handbook: 
the Celestial and the Hexblade. 

THE  CELESTIAL 

Your patron is a powerful be ing of the Upper Planes. 
You have bound yourself to an ancient e mpyrean, solar, 
ki-rin, unicorn, or other entity that resides in the planes 
of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you 
to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illu 
minates the multiverse. 

Being connected to such power can cause changes in 
you r behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven 
to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect 
the innocent. At times, your heart might a lso be filled 
with a  longing for the celes tial realm of your patron, 
and a desire to wander that paradise for the res t of your 
days . But you know that your mission is among mortals 
fo r now, and that your pact binds you to bring light to the 
dark places of the world.

At 1s t level, you learn the light and sacred flame can 
trips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they 
don't count against your number of cantrips known. 

HEALING LIGHT 
At 1st level, you gain the abi lity to channel celestial 
energy to heal wounds. You  have a  pool of d6s that you 
s pend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in  the 
pool equals 1 + your warlock level. 

As a  bonus action, you can heal one creature you can 
see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. 
The maximum number of dice you can spend at once 
equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one d ie). 

Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore 
a number of hit points equal to the total. 

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a 

long rest. 

EXPANDED SPELL LIST 
The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 

RADIANT SOUL 
Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows 
you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have 
resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell 
that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Cha 
risma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that 
spell against one of its ta rgets. 

CELESTIAL RESILIENCE 
Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary  hit points 
whenever you finish a short or long rest. These tempo 
rary hit points equal your warlock level+ you r  Charisma 
modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you 
can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain 
temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + 
your Charisma modifier. 

SEARING VENGEANCE 
Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel 
allows you to resist death. When you have to make a 
death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can 
instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant 
energy. You  regain hit points equal to hal f your h it point 
maximum, and then you stand up i f you so choose. Each 
creatu re of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes 
radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, 
and it is blinded until the end of the current turn. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 

you finish a long rest. 

THE HEXBLADE 

You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from 
the Shadowfell- a force that manifests in sentient magic 
weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty 
sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, 
which have been spread across the multiverse over the 
ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can 
offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many 
hexblade warlocks create weapons that emul ate those 
formed i n  the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, 
content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their 
spellcasting. 

Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged  the 

first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she 
and the force are one and that the weapons, along with 
hexblade warlocks, are tool s she uses to manipulate 
events on the Ma.terial Plane to her inscrutabl e ends.

ful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one 
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is 
cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target 
dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse 
ends, you gain the following benefits: 

•  You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed 
target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus. 

•  Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a 

critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. 

•  If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal 

to your warlock level +you r C harisma modi fier  (min i 
mum of 1 hit point). 

You can't use this feature agai n u ntil you  finish a shor t 
or long rest. 

HExWARRIOR 
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effec 
tively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with 
medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. 

The i nfluence of your patron also allows you to mys 
tically channel your will through a particular weapon. 
Whenever you fin ish a long rest, you can touch one 
weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks 
the two-handed property. When you attack with that 
weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. 
This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later

AMBITION 

Few aspi ring wizards  undertake the study of magic 
without some personal goal in  mind. Many wizards use 
their spells as a  tool to produce a  tangible  benefit, in ma 
terial goods or in status, fo r themselves or their compan 
ions. For o thers, the theoretical aspect of magic might 
have a strong appeal, pushing those wizards to seek out 
knowledge that s upports  new theories of the arcane or 
confirms old o nes. 

Beyond  the o bvious, why does your wiza rd character 
study magic, a nd what do you want to achieve? If you ha 
ven't given these questions much thoug ht, you can do so 
now, and the answers you come  up with will likely affect 
how your future unfolds.

Ambition 
You will  prove that the gods aren't as powerful as 
folk  believe . 
Immortality is the end goal of your s tudies . 
If you  can fully  understand  magic, you can unlock

Magic is a dangerou s tool. You  use it to protect 
what you t reasure. 
Arcane power mus t be taken away from those who 

would abuse it. 
You will  become the greatest wizard  the world has 
seen in generations. 

WIZARD 

WIZARDRY REQUIRES UNDERSTANDlNC. THE KNOWLEDGE 

of how and why magic works, and our efforts to broaden 
that understanding, have brought about th e key advances 
in civilization over the centuries. 

- Gimble  the illus io nist 

Only a select few people in  the world a re wielders of 
magic. Of all  those, wizards s tand at the pin nacle of 
the craft. Even the least of them can manipulate forces 
that flout the laws of nature, and the most accomplished 
among them can cast spells with world-shaking effects. 
The price th at wizards pay for their mastery is that 
mos t valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of 
s tudy,  instruction, and experimen tation to learn how to 
harness magical energy and carry s pells  around in o ne's 
own mind. For adventuring wizards a nd other spellcast 
e rs who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, 
the s tudying never ends, nor does the quest for knowl 
ed ge a nd power. 

If you're playing a wizard, take advantage of the 
opportunity to ma ke your characte r more than just a 
s tereotypical spell-slinger. Use the advice that follows to 
add some intrig uing details  to how your wiza rd interacts 
with the world. 

SPELLBOOK 

Your wizard character's most prized possess ion- your 
spellbook- mig ht be a n innocuous-looking volu me 
w hose covers show no hint of what's ins ide. Or you 
mig ht display some flair, as many wizards do, by car 
rying a spellbook of an unus ua l s ort. If you d on't own 
s uch a n item already, one of your goals  might be  to find 
a spellbook that sets you a part by its appeara nce or its 
means of ma nufacture.

ECCENTRICITY 

Endless hours of solitary s tudy and research can have 
a  negative effect on a nyone's social s kills. Wizards, w ho 
a re a  breed apart to begin with, are no exception. An 
odd manneris m or two is  not necessarily a drawback, 
though; a n eccentricity of this sort is us ua lly harmless 
and could  provide a source of amusement or serve as a 
calling card of sorts. 

If your character has a n eccentricity, is it a  physical 
tic or a mental one? Are you well  known in some ci rcles 
because of it? Do you fight to overcome it, or do you em 
brace this minor claim to fa me of yours?

Eccentricity 
You  have the habit of tapping your foot incessantly, 
which often annoys those around you. 
Your memory is  quite good,  but you have no trou 
ble pretending to be absentminded when it suits 

your purposes . 
You  never enter a  room without looking to  see 
what's hanging from the ceiling. 
Your m ost prized  possession  is  a  dead worm that 

you keep inside a  potion vial. 
When you want people to leave you alone, you  start 
talking to you rself. That usually does  the trick. 
Your fashion  sense and grooming, o r more ac 
curately  lack thereof, sometimes cause others to 
ass ume  you  are a  beggar. 

ARCANE TRADITION 
At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition fea 
ture . The following War Magic option is available  to a 
w izard, in addition to the options offered in the Play 
er's Handbook. 

WAR MAGIC 
A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wiz 
ards  for war. The tradition of War Magic blends princi 
ples of evocation a nd abjuration, rather than specia li z 
ing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that 
empower a caster's s pells , while also providing methods 
for wizards to bols ter their own defenses. 

Followers  of this tradition are known as war mages. 
They see their magic as both a weapon a nd armor, a  re 
source s uperior to any piece of s teel. War mages act fast 
in battle, using their spells  to seize tactical control of a 
s ituation.  Thei r spells s trike hard, while  their defensive 
skills  foi l their opponents' attempts to counterattack. 
War mages are a lso adept at turning o ther spellcasters' 
magical energy against them. 

In great battles, a wa r mage often works with evokers, 

abjurers, a nd other types of wizards. Evokers, in par 
ticular, sometimes tease war mages for s plitt ing their 
a ttention between offense and defense. A war mage's 
ty pical response: "What good is  being able to throw a 
mighty fireball if I die  before I can cast it?"

TACTICAL WIT 
Starting at 2nd level, your keen ability  to assess tacti cal 
s ituations a llows you to act quickly in battle. You  can 
give yourself a bonus  to your initiative rolls equal to your 
Intelligence modi fie r. 

POWER SURGE 
Starting at 6th level, you can store magical e nergy 
within you rself to later empower your damaging s pe lls. 
In its stored form, this energy is called a  power surge. 
You  can store a  ma ximum number of power surges 
equal to your Intell igence modifier (minimum of one). 
Whenever you finis h a  long rest, you r number of powe r 
surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end 
a  spell with dispel magic or counterspell, you gain o ne 
power surge, as you steal m agic from the spell you 
foiled. If you end a s hor t rest with no power su rges, you 
gain one power s urge. 

Once  per t urn when you deal damage to a creature 
or object w ith a wizard spell, you ca n spend o ne  power 
surge to deal extra force damage  to that target. T he ex 
tra damage equals half your wizard level. 

DURABLE  MAGIC 
Beginning at 10th  level, the magic you cha nnel helps 
ward off harm. While you maintain concentration o n a 
spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws. 

DEFLECTING  SHROUD 
At  14th level, your Arcane Deflection becomes infused 
with deadly magic. W hen you use your Arca ne Deflec 
tion  feature, you ca n cause magical e nergy to arc from 
you. Up to three creatures of your choice  that you can 
see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal 
to ha lf you r wizard level. 

THrs Is YouR LIFE 
The c ha racte r c reation rules in the P lay er's Handbook 
provide a ll  the  information you need  to de fine your cha r 
acte r in  preparation for a  life of adventuring. Wha t they 
don't do is account for a ll  the circ umstances tha t s haped 
your c haracter during the years  be tween your birth a nd 
the s ta rt of your career as a  membe r of a  class. 

W hat did your cha racter accomplis h or expe r ience be 
fore deciding to become a n adventurer? W ha t were  the 
circ ums tances of your birth? How la rge  is your fam ily, 
a nd what sor ts of relationships  do you h ave with your 
re latives? Which people we re  the greatest influe nces on 
you during your formative year s, for bette r or worse? 
To a nswer  these questions an d  more, you ca n use 
the tables a nd the advice in this  section to compose a 
well-developed backstory for your ch aracter-an a u to 
biography of sorts - tha t you can use to inform h ow you 
role play the  ch a rac ter. Your DM can  draw from this m a 
te ria l as the  ca mpa ign proceeds, c reating situations and 
scenarios tha t build off your previous  life experiences. 

IDEAS,  NOT RULES 

--------------

Even though  these pages a re  full  o f tables and die rolls, 
they don't make  up a  ru les syste m- in fact, the opposite 
is  true . You can  use as much or as little o f this  material 
as you desire, and you ca n m a ke  decisions in a ny o r 
de r you want. 

For instance, you mi gh t oot want these tables to  help 
you d ecide who your parents a nd s iblings are, because 
that's a mong the  informa tion you've already come up 
with. But you can  s till  use othe r  parts, s uc h as the  sec 
tion on life events, to  provide  added depth a nd d etail. 

How AND  WHEN TO  USE THE TABLES 
U you're  comfortable with le tting the dice decide a  cer 
tain fact about your c haracter, go a head and roll. If not, 
you can ta ke  charge and m ake the decision, c hoos ing 
from among the possibilities on a  table. Of course, you 
a lso  have  the  option o f dis rega rding the result of a die 
roll if it conflicts w ith a nother result. Like wise, if the 
text instruc ts you  to  roll on a  table, that's not meant to 
be  ta ke n lite r ally. You can a lways make your own choice. 

Althoug h these ta bles are m ean t to a ugme nt the 
s tep-by-step character creation process in  the Player's 
Handbook, they don't occupy a specific place in that pro 
cess. You ca n use some of t he m  early on- for instance, 
it's  possible to de te rmine your paren ts a nd othe r family 
me mbe rs  immediately after deciding your character's 
race-but you cou ld  a lso wait until la ter in the  process. 
You  might prefer  to establis h more  facts a bout your 
c h a racter 's  gam e  identity-suc h as your class, a bility 
scores, and alignme nt- before s upple me nting that infor 
mation w ith w ha t's offe red  he re. 

SECTION BY SECTION 
This m a te ria l is divided into four secti ons, each address 
ing a different aspect of your cha racter 's backstory. 

Origins. To find out who and whe re you came  from , 
use the  "Origins" section. Whe n you're done, you will 
have a  s umma ry of facts a bout your parents, your sib 
lings, a nd t he  circumstances under which you grew  up.

Personal Decisions. After you  have selected your 

c ha racter's background a nd class, use the  a ppro

those c hoices. 

Life Events. Your character's existence until now, no 
matter how brief or uneventful, h as been marked by one 
or  more  life  events-me m ora ble happen ings that have 
had an effect on wh o you are today. 

Supplemental Tables. Your life  has intersected with 
the  lives of plenty of other people, a ll  the way from your 
infancy to today. When a  resu lt mentions such a person, 
you ca n use the supplemental tables (page 72) to add 
needed details- s uc h as race, class, or occupation- to 
that person. Some tables in  the other sections direct you 
to one or more of the s upple mental tables, and you ca n 
also use the m  a ny othe r time you see fit. 

ORIGINS - - - - - - -
The us ual first step in c reating your character's life s tory 
is  to determine your ea rly circums tances. W ho  were 
your parents? Where were you born? Did you h ave a ny 
siblings? Who raised you? You ca n address these ques 
tio ns  by using the following tables. 

PARENTS 
You had p a rents, of course, even if they didn't r aise you. 
To dete rmine what you know about these people, use 
the Parents  table . If you want, you can roll  sep a rately on 
the table  for your mother a nd your father. Use t he s up 
ple me nta l tables as desired (partic ularly Class, Occupa 
tion, a nd Alignment) to learn more a bout your parents.

CRIMINAL 

d6 

I became a criminal  because ...

life of crime as the best way to fight against tyranny 
and oppression.

the only way I could survive. 
I fell  in  with a  gang of repro bates and ne'er-do 
wells, and I learned my specialty from them. 
A parent or re lative taught me my crim inal spe 
cialt y to prepare me for the family  business.

enough so that I could make them laugh or cry 
with my stories or songs. 
I ran away from  home to fo llow a  m instrel  troupe.

wished  I cou ld  be something more than ordinary. 
I hated my mundane life,  so when it was time for 
someone to step up and do the right thing,  I took 
my chance. 
A parent or o ne of my relatives was an adventurer, 
and  I was inspired by that person's courage.

HERMIT 

d6

My enemies rui ned my reputation, and I fled  to the 
wilds to avoid further disparagement. 
I am comfortable with being isolated, as I seek 
inner peace. 
I never liked the people I called  my friends, so it 
was easy for me to strike out on my own. 
I felt compelled to forsake my past, but did so with 
great reluctance, and sometimes I regret making 
that decision. 
I lost everything-my home, my family,  my friends. 
Going it alone was all  I could do. 
Society's decadence disgusted me, so I decided to 
leave it  behind.

have distinguished themselves s ince we gained it. 
My  family is  filled  with  remarkable people. I hope 
to live  up to their examp le. 
I hope to increase my fam ily's power and influence.

learned the methods of survival from my famil y. 
After a  tragedy I retreated to the wilderness, leav 
ing my old life behind.

for more knowledge.

was forced  to work for  m y passage. 

Reavers attacked  my community, so I found  refuge

A supernatu ral  being in  service to th e gods called 
me to become a divine agent in the world. 
I saw the injustice and horror in the world and felt 
moved to take a  stand against them. 
My god gave me an  unmistakable sign.  I dropped 
everything to serve the divine. 
Although  I was always devout, it wasn 't until  I com  
pleted a  pilgrimage that I knew my true calling. 
I used to serve in  my religion's bureaucracy but 
found  I needed to work in  the wo rld, to bring t he 
message  of my faith  to the darkest corners of the 
land. 
I realize that my god works through me, and I do as 
commanded, even though  I don't  know why  I was 
chosen to serve. 

DRUID

I became a  druid because ... 

I saw too much devastation in the wild  places, too 
much of nature's splendor ruined by the despoil 
ers. I joined a circle of druids to fight back against 
the enemies of nature. 
I found a  place a mong a group of druids after I fled 
a catastrophe. 
I have always had an affin ity for animals, so I ex 
plored my talent to see how I cou ld  best use it. 
I befriended a druid and was moved by druidic 
teachings . I decided to follow my friend's guidance 
and give something back to the world . 
While I was growing up,  I saw spi rits all  around 
me- entities  no one else could perceive. I sought 
out the druids to help me understand  the vis ions 
and communicate with these beings. 
I have a lways felt disgust for creatures of unnatural 
origin.  For this reason,  I immersed myself in the 
study of the druidic mysteries and became a  cham 
pion of the natural order.

refuge in a  strange monastery, where I learned how 
to defend myself against the forces of darkness. 
I was overwhelmed with grief after losing someone 
close to me,  and I sought the advice of philoso 
phers to help me cope with my loss. 
I could feel  that a  special sort of power lay within 
me, so I sought out those who could help me call  it 
forth and master it. 
I was wild  and undisciplined as a youngster,  but 
then  I realized the error of my ways.  I applied to a 
monastery and became a  monk as a way to live a

better combat foes of that sort. 

An experienced  rogue saw something in me and 
taught  me several  useful  t ricks. 

I decided to turn m y natural lucky streak into the 
basis of a career, though  I still  realize that improv 

ing my skills is essential. 

I took up with a group of ruffians who showed m e 

how to get what I want through sneakiness rather 
than direct confrontation. 

I'm a sucker fo r a shiny bauble o r a  sack of coins,

harbinger of stranger t hings to come for me . 
I s uffered a  terrible emotiona l or phys ical  strain, 

which brought forth my latent magical  power.  I 

have fought to control it ever since. 

My immediate fami ly never s poke of my ancestors, 
and when I asked, they would change the subject. 
It wasn't until  I started displaying strange talents 

that the full  truth of my heritage came out.

serve as a  beacon oflight shining out against the 

gathering shadows. 

I served as a  palad in's squ ire , learn ing all  I needed 
to swear my own sacred  oath. 

Evil  must be opposed on all  fronts.  I feel com 
pelled to seek out wickedness and purge it from 

the world. 

Becoming a  paladin was a  natural consequence of 
my unwave ring fa ith.  In  taking my vows , I became 
the holy sword of my religion. 

RANGER 

d6 

I became a  ranger because ... 

I found  purpose while  I honed my hunting skills  by 
bringing down dangerous animals at the edge of 
civilization. 

I a lways had a way with animals, able to calm them 
with a  soothing wo rd  and a touch. 

I suffer from terrible wa nderlust, so being a ranger 
gave me a reason not to remain in one place fo r 

too long. 

I have seen what happens when the monsters 
come out from t he  dark. I took it upon myself to 
become the first line of defense against the evils 
that lie beyond civilization's borders. 

I met a grizzled ranger who taught me woodcraft 
and the secrets of the wild  lands. 

I served in  an army,  learning the precepts of my 
professio n while blazing trails and scouting e nemy

When  I became lost in  a fores t, a  hedge wizard 
found  me, took me in,  and taught me t he  rudi

I grew up listening to tales of great wizards and 
knew I wanted to follow their path.  I strove to be 
accepted at an  academy of magic and  succeeded. 
One of my relatives was an accom plished wizard 
who decided I was smart enough to learn the craft. 

While exploring an old tomb, libra ry,  or tem ple, 
I fo und a spellbook.  I was immediately driven to 
learn all  I could about becoming a wizard. 
I was a prodigy who demonstrated mastery of the 
arcane arts at an early age. When  I became old 
enough to set o ut on m y own,  I did so to learn 
more magic and expand my power.

RACIAL FEATS 
Leveling up in a class is the main way a character 
evolves during a campaign. Some DMs a lso allow the 
use of feats to customize a character. Feats a re an op 
tional rule in chapter 6, "Customization Options," of the 
Player's Handbook. The DM decides whether they're 
used a nd may also decide that some feats are available 
in a campaign and others aren't. 

This section introduces a collection of special feats 

that a llow you to explore your character's race fur 
ther. These feats are each associated with a  race from 
the Player's Handbook, as summarized in the Racial 
Feats table. A  racial feat represents either a deepening 
connection to your race's culture or a physical trans  
formation tha t brings you closer to a n aspect of your 
race's lineage. 

The cause of a  particular transformation is up to you 
and your DM. A transformational feat can symbolize a 
latent quality that has emerged as you age, o r a  transfor 
mation might be the result of an event in the campaign, 
s uch as expos ure  to powerful magic or visiting a place of 
ancient s ignificance  to your race. Transformations a re a 
fundamental motif of fantasy literature and folklore. Fig 
uring out why your character has changed can be a  r ich 
addition to your campaign's story.

WHAT'S  NEXT? 

W hen you're finished using these tables, you' ll  have a 
collection of facts and notes that- at a  minimum- encap 
s ulate what your character has been doing in the world 
up till now. Sometimes that might be all the information 
you want, but you don't have  to stop there. 

By using your creativity to stitch a ll  these bits  together 
into a continuous narrative, you can create a fu ll-Aedged 
autobiography for your character in as little as a few 
sentences-an excellent example of how the whole is 
greater than the sum of its parts. 

Did you get a couple of results on the tables that don't 
outright contradict each other but also don't seem to fit 
together smoothly? If so, now is your chance to expla in 
what happened to you. For instance, let's say you were 
born in a castle, but your childhood home was in the 
wilderness. It could be that your parents traveled from 
their forest home  to seek help from a  midwife at the 
castle when your mother was close to giving birth. Or 
your parents might have been  me mbers of the castle's 
staff before you were born, but they were released from 
service soon  after you came into the world. 

In add ition to deepening your own roleplaying experi 
ence, your character 's  history presents your DM with op 
portunities to weave those elements into the story of the 
campaign. Any way you look at it, addi ng definition to 
your character's  pre-adventuring life is time well spent.

S  THE DUNGEON M ASTER,  YOU OVERSEE 
the game and  weave togethe r  the story ex 
perienced by your players. You're the one 
who keeps it a ll going, a nd this ch a pter is 
for you. It gives you new rules options, as 
well as some  re fined tools  for creating and 
running adventures and ca mpaigns. It is a 
supple me nt to the tools and advice offered 

in the Dungeon Master's Guide. 

The chapter opens  with optiona l rules mean t to help 
you run cer tai n  parts of the game more smoothly. The 
chapte r  the n goes into g reater de pth on severa l topi cs 
e ncounter building, random e ncounte rs, traps, magic 
items, and downtime-which la rgely re late to how you 
c reate a nd s tage your adventures. 

The  mate ria l in  this chapter is meant to make your 
life easie r. Ignore anything you find  here that doesn't 
help you, a nd don't hesita te  to c us tom ize the things  t hat 
you do use. The game's rules exist to serve you and the 
games you run. As a lways, make them your own. 

SIMULTANEOUS  EFFECTS 
Most effects in the game h a ppe n in s uccession, follow 
ing an order set by the rules or the DM. In ra re cases, 
effects ca n happen at the sa me time, especiaUy at t he 
start or e nd of a c reature's turn. If two or more  things 
happe n a t the same  time  on a  character or monste r 's 
turn , the pe rson at the game table-whe the r player or 
DM-who controls  that creature decides the order in 
which those things happen. For exa mple, if two effects 
occur at the e nd of a  player c ha racter's turn, the  player 
decides wh ic h of the  two e ffects happens firs t. 

FALLING 
Falling from a great heig ht is  a s ignifica nt ris k for ad 
venture rs and their foes. The rule given in the Player's 
Handbook  is s imple: at the end of a  fall , you take ld6 
bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fe ll, to a  maxi 
mum of 20d6. You also la nd prone, un less you somehow 
avoid taking damage from the fall. Here a re two optional 
rules that expand on t hat s imple  rule. 

RATE  OF FALLING 
The rule for fa lling assum es that a creature  immediately 
drops the  e ntire distance whe n it fa lls. But what if a 
creature  is a t a high altitude when it fa lls, pe rhaps  on 
the back of a griffon or on board an airs hip? Realisti 
cally, a  fa ll  fro m such a  height can ta ke more than a few 
seconds, extending past the e nd o f t he  turn when the  fa ll 
occurred . If you'd like hi gh-altitude fa lls  to be  properly 
ti me-consuming, use the following optiona l rule. 

When you fa ll  from a g reat height, you instantly de 
scend up to 500 feet. If you're still fa lling o n your next 

turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end o f that turn. 
This  process continues untiJ  the  fall ends, either be 
cause you hit t he ground or the fa ll  is otherwise halted. 

FLYING  CREATURES AND  FALLING 
A flying creature in fligh t fa lls  if it is  knocked prone, if 
its  speed is  reduced  to 0  feet,  or if it otherwise loses t he 
ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held 
aloft by magic, s uc h as t he fly  spell. 

If you'd like a  flying c reature  to have a  better ch ance of 
s urviving a  fall  tha n a  no n-flyi ng creature does, use this 
rule : s ubtract the creature's cu rrent flying speed from 
the dista nce it fell  before calculating fall ing damage. 
T his  rule  is  helpful to a  flier that is knocked prone but 
is still conscious and has a c urre nt flying speed that is 
greater t han 0  feet. T he  rule is  designed  to s im ulate t he 
c reature  flappin g its w ings furi ously o r taking s imilar 
measures to slow the velocity of its fa ll. 

If you use the rule for rate of fa lling in the previous 
section, a  flying creature  descends 500 feet on the  turn 
w he n it fa lls, just as other c reatures do. But if th a t c rea 
tu re starts any of its la ter  turns s till falling and is  prone, 
it ca n ha lt the  fall  on its turn by s pe nding ha lf its flying 
speed to counte r the  prone condition (as if it were stand 
ing  up in  mida ir). 

SLEEP 
Ju st as in the rea l world , D&D characte rs spend  ma ny 
hours s leeping,  most often as pa rt of a long rest. Most 
mons te rs  a lso need to sleep. While a c reature s leeps, 
it is s ubjected  to t he  unconscious condition. Here a re a 
few rules that expand o n that basic fact. 

WAKING SOMEONE 
A c reature t hat is  naturally s leeping, as opposed to be 
ing in a  magically or chemically ind uced sleep, wakes 
up if it takes  any damage or if someone else uses an ac 
tion  to shake or slap t he c reature awake. A s udden loud 
noise- s uc h as yelling, thunder, or a  ringing bell-also 
awakens som eone that is s leeping naturaUy. 

Whispers  don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's pas 
s ive Wis dom (Perception) score is 20 or higher and t he 
whispers a re within 10 feet of the s leeper. Speech a t a 
norma l volume awakens a s leeper  if th e environme nt 
is otherwise s ilent (no wind, birdsong, c ric kets, street 
sou nds, or the  like) and  the s leeper has a  passive Wis 
dom (Perception) score of 15 or higher. 

SLEEPING IN ARMOR 
Sleeping in  light armor has  no adverse effect on the 
wea re r, but sleeping in medium or heavy a rmor ma kes it 
difficult to recover fully during a  long rest. 

CHAPTER 2  DUNCl!01'  MASTER'S TOOLS 

When you finish a long res t during w hich you slept in 
medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of 
your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you  have 
a ny levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn't reduce your 
exhaustion level. 

GOING WITHOUT A  LONG REST 

A long rest is  never ma ndatory, but going without s leep 
does have its consequences. If you want to account for 
the effects of s leep deprivation on characters a nd crea 
tures, use  these rules. 

Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing 

a  long rest, you mus t s ucceed on a DC  10 Constitution 
saving throw or s uffer one level of ex haus tion. 

It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay 

awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the 
DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period 
without a long rest. The DC resets  to 10 when you finish 
a long rest. 

ADAMANTINE WEAPONS 
Adamantine is an ultrahard m etal found in meteorites 
and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being 
used  to craft adamantine armor, the  metal is a lso used 
for wea pons. 

Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated 

with adamantine are unus ually effective w hen  used 
to break objects. Whenever a n adamantine weapon 
or piece of ammunition hits a n object, the  hit is  a 
critical hit. 

The adamantine version of a  melee weapon or of 
ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more  than the 
norma l version, whether the weapon or am munition is 
made of the metal or coated w ith it. 

TYING KNOTS 
The rules  are  purposely open-ended concerning mun 
dane  tasks like tying knots, but sometim es knowing 
how well a  knot was fas hioned is importa nt in a dra 
ma tic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or 
slip out of one. Her e's an optional rule for determining 
the effective ness of a  knot. 

The creature who ties the knot makes a n Intelligence 
(Sleight of Hand) check when doing so. The total of the 
check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie  the knot 
with a n Intelligence (Sleight of Hand) check or to s lip 
out of it with a Dex terity (Acrobatics) check. 

This rule intentionally links Sleight of Ha nd with 
Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This  is a n example 
of how to apply the  rule in the "Va ria nt: Skills with 
Differe nt Abilities" section  in chapter 7 of the Play 
er's Handbook. 

TOOL PROFICIENCIES 
Tool proficiencies a re a  useful way to highlight a charac 
ter's background and tale nts. At the game table, though, 
the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of 
s kills, a nd it can be  unclear bow to use them together in 
certain situations. This section offers various ways that 
tools can be  used in the game. 

TOOLS AND  SKILLS TOGETHER 

Tools  have  more s pecific applications tha n skills. The 
History skill applies to any event in  the past. A tool s uch 
as a forge ry kit is used  to make fake objects and little 
else. Thus, why wou ld a character who has the opportu 
nity to acquire one or the other want to gain a  tool profi 
cie ncy instead of proficie ncy in a skill? 

To ma ke  tool  proficiencies more a ttractive choices for 
the cha racters, you can use  the  methods outlined below. 
Advantage. If the  use of a  tool a nd the use of a skill 
both apply to a check, and a  character is  proficie nt with 
the  tool and the skill, consider allowing the cha racter 
to make  the check with adva ntage. This s imple benefit 
can go a  lo ng way toward e ncouraging players  to pick 
up tool  proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, 
this  bene fit is often expressed as additional insight (or 
something s imilar), wh ich  translates into a n increased 
cha nce that the check will  be a s uccess. 

Added Benefit. In addition , conside r giving characters 

who have both a  relevant skill and a  relevant tool profi 
ciency a n added benefit  on a s uccessful  check. This b en 
efit might be in the form of more detailed information or 
could s imulate the effect of a different sort of s uccessful 
check.  For example, a cha racter proficient with mason's 
tools  m akes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the char 
acter notice the door's presence, but you decide that the 
tool  proficiency entitles the character to an automatic 
success on a n Intelligence (Investigation) check to deter 
mine how to open the door. 

TOOL DESCRIPTIONS 

The  following sections go into detail a bout the tools  pre 
sented  in the Player's Handbook, offering advice on how 
to  use  the m in a campaign. 

Components. The first paragra ph in each description 

gives details on what a set of s upplies  or tools is  made 
up of. A character who is proficient with a  tool knows 
how to  use a ll  of its component pa rts. 

Skills. Every tool potentially provides advantage on a 
check when used in conjunction with certa in skills, pro 
vided a character is proficient with the tool a nd the skill. 
As DM, you can allow a cha racter to make a check using 
the indicated skill with advantage. P aragraphs that be 
gin with skill  names discuss these possibilities. In each 
of these paragraphs, the  benefits apply only to someone 
who has  proficiency with the  tool, not someone who s im 
ply owns it. 

With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in 
te rms of wha t a  tool proficiency represents; essentially, 
it assumes that a characte r who has  proficiency with a 
tool also has learned about facets of the trade or pro 
fession that are not necessarily associated with the use 
of the tool. 

In addition, you can consider giving a character extra 

information or an added benefit on a skill check. The 
text provides some examples a nd ideas whe n this oppor 
tunity is relevant. 

Special Use. Proficiency with a  tool usually brings 
with it a  particula r benefit in the form  of a special use, 
as described in this  paragraph. 

Sample DCs. A table  at the end of each section lists 

activities that a  tool can be used to perform, and s ug 
gested DCs for the necessary a bility c hecks.

Arcana. Proficiency w ith alchemist's s upplies allows 

you to unloc k mo re  informa tion on Arcan a c heck s  in 
volving  potions  a nd simila r m ateria ls. 

Investigation. When you inspect an a rea fo r clues, 
proficie ncy with a lc he mist's supplies grants addit ional 
ins ig ht in to any chemicals  or othe r s ubs ta nces that 
might have been u sed in  the area. 

Alchemical Crafting. You ca n use this tool proficiency 

to c reate alchemical items. A c h aracter can s pe nd

large wooden objects. 

Investigation. You gain additional insight when in 
specting areas within wooden structures, because you 
know tricks of construction that can conceal areas from 
discovery. 

Perception. You  can spot irregu la rities in wooden 
walls or flo ors, making it easier to find  trap doors and 
secret passages. 

Stealth. You can quickly assess the weak spots in a 
wooden floor,  making it easier to avoid the places that 
creak and groan when they're stepped on. 

Fortify. With 1 minute of work and raw materials,

types of ink, a va riety of parc hments and papers, several 
quills, seals a nd sealin g wax, gold and silver leaf, and 
small tools to sculpt melted wax to mimic a  seal . 

Arcana. A forgery kit can  be  used in conjunc tion 
with the Arcana s kill  to determine  if a  magic ite m  is 
real or fake. 

Deception. A well-crafte d  forgery, such as papers pro 
claiming you to be a  noble or a w rit that grants you safe 
passage, can lend c redence to a lie. 

History. A forgery ki t combined w ith your knowle d ge 
of history improves your ability to create fake historical 
docume nts or to tell if a n old doc ument is a uthe ntic. 

Investigation. When you examine objects, proficie ncy 

with a  forgery kit is  useful for determining how a n ob 
ject was made a nd whether it is genuine. 

Other Tools. Knowledge of other  tools  makes your 
forgeries that much more be lievable. For example, you 
could combine proficie n cy with a  forgery kit and profi 
cie ncy with cartogra phe r's  tools  to make a fake  map. 

Quick Fake. As part of a  s hort rest, you can produce 
a  forged docume nt no more  than one page in le ngth. As 
part o f a long r est, you can  produce a doc ument that is 
up to four pages long. Your Intellige nce c heck u sing a

of its  history, as we ll  as of important events  it was con  
nected to or promine nt his torical figures involved w ith it. 
Insight. P laying games with som eon e is a  good way to 

gain unders tanding of their pe rsonality, granting you a 
better a bility to discern their lies from  the ir truths  and

PERCEIVING A  CASTER AT WORK 

Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, 
wa lls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, 
such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or oth 
erwise perceptible s ign of their effects, and could easily 
go unnoticed by someone una ffected  by them. As noted 
in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that 
a  spell  has been cast unless the spell produces a  notice 
able effect. 

But what about the act of casting a  spell? Is it possible 
for someone to perceive  that a spell is being cast in their 
presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a  spell must 
involve  a  verba l, somatic, or material component. The 
form of a  material component doesn't matte r for the 
purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified 
in the spell's  description, a component pouch, or a  spell 
casting focus. 

If the need for a  spell's  components has been removed 

by a special abi lity, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell 
feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by 
many creatures, the casting of th e s pell is  imperceptible. 
If an impe rceptible casting produces a  perceptible  ef 
fect, it's normally impossible  to dete rmine who cast the 
spell  in  the absence of other evidence. 

IDENTIFYING A  SPELL 

Sometimes a character wants to identify a  spell that 
someone else is  casting or that was  a lready cast. To do 
so, a c haracter can use their reaction to identify a  spell 
as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn 
to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast. 

If the character perceived the casting, the spell's ef 
fect, or both, the  character can make an Intelligence (Ar 
cana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 
15 + the spel l's level. If the spell is cast as a  class spell 
and the ch aracter is a  member of that class, the check 
is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster 
casts a  spell  as a  cleric, another cleric has advantage on 
the ch eck to identify the spell. Some spells  aren't asso 
ciated wit h any class when they're cast, such as when a 
monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait. 

This Intelligence (Arcana) check r epresents the fact 
that identifying a spell  requires a  quick mind and famil 
iarity with.the theory and practice o f casting. This is 
true even for a  ch aracter whose spellcasting abil ity is 
W isdom or Charisma. Being able  to cast spells doesn't 
by itself make you adept at d educi ng exactly what others 
are doing when they cast their spells. 

INVALID  SPELL TARGETS 

A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any 
type of creature, a  c reature of a  certain type (humanoid 
or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, 
or something else. But w hat happens if a spell tar-
gets something that isn't a  valid target? For example, 

CHAPTER 2  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

someone might cast charm person on a creature be 
lieved to be a  humanoid, not knowing that the  target is 
in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using 
the  following rule. 

If you cast a spell on someone or something tha t can't 

be affected by the spell, nothing happens  to that target, 
but if you used a spell s lot to cast the spell, the s lot is 
still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a 
target that s ucceeds  on a saving  throw, the invalid target 
appears to  h ave succeeded on its saving throw, even 
though it d idn't attempt one (giving no hint tha t the c rea 
ture is in fact a n inva lid target). Otherwise, you perceive 
that the s pell did nothing to t he  targe t. 

AREAS  OF EFFECT ON A  GRID 

The Dungeon Master's Guide includes t he following 
short rule  for using areas of e ffect on a grid. 

Choose an inte rsection of squa res as the point of 
origi n of an area of effect, then follow the rules for t hat 
kind of area as normal (see the "Areas of Effect" section 
in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of ef 
fect is circular a nd covers a t least h alf a square, it affects 
that s quare. 

That rule works, but it can require a  fair amou nt of 
on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two a lte rna 
tives for determining the exact location o f an area: the 
te mplate method and  the  token method. Both of these 
methods assume you're  using a g rid and mi niatures of 
some sort. Because these methods can y ield different 
res ults  fo r the  number of squares in a  given a rea, it's 
not recommended  that they be combined at the table 
choose w hicheve r method you a nd your players  find eas 
ier or more intuitive. 

TEMPLATE  METHOD 
The template method uses two-dimensional shapes 
th a t represent differe nt a reas of effect. The a im of the 
method is  to accurately portray the le ngth and width 
of each area on the grid and to leave little  dou bt about 
w hic h creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make 
these templates or find  premad e ones. 

Making a Template. Making a template is s imple. Get 
a  piece of paper or card stock, and c ut it in the shape of 
the area of effect you're us ing. Every 5 feet of t he area 
equals  1 inch of the templa te's size. For example, the 
2 0 -foot- rad ius s phe re of the fireball sp ell, which has a 
40-foot diame te r, wou ld translate  into a  circ ula r te m 
plate with an 8-inch diameter. 

Using a  Template. To use an a rea-of-effect te mplate, 
apply it to the grid. If t he  te rrain is flat, you ca n lay it on 
the s urface; othe rwise, hold  the template a bove the s ur 
face and take note of which squares it covers or partially 
covers. If any part of a s quare is  under  the template, th a t 
s quare is included in the area of effect. If a  creature's 
miniature is  in a n affected square, that creature  is in 
the  area. Being adjacent to the edge o f the template 
isn 't enough for a s quare to be included in the  area of 
effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by 
the  template. 

You ca n a lso use this method w ithout a grid. If you do 
so, a creature  is included in a n  area of effect if a ny part 
of the  miniature's base is  overlapped by the  te mpl a te.

nates from a spellcaster, t he  template s hould extend out 
from  th e caste r a nd be positioned  however the caster 
likes within t he  bo unds of the  rules.

in action. 

TOK EN  M ETHO D 
The token method is  mea nt to ma ke  a reas of effect 
tactile and fun . To use t his  m ethod, gra b s ome dice or 
other  toke ns, w hich you're going to use to re present your 
a reas of effect. 

Rath er than fa ithfu lly re presenting the s ha pes of the 
different areas o f effect, this  me thod gives you a way to 
create square-ed ged vers ions  of them  on  a  grid easily, as 
described in the  followi ng s ubsections. 

Using  Tok ens . Every 5-foot squa re of a n area of e ffect 
becomes a  die or other  token that you place on t he grid. 
Each  token goes inside  a square, not at a n intersection 
of lines. If a n area's token is  in a s quare, that s quare is 
incl uded  in the area of effect. It's that s imple. 

D iagra ms  2.3 t h rough 2.6 s how this method in action, 

us ing dice as the tokens. 

Circles. This method depicts everything using 

squa res, and a  circula r a rea of effect becomes s quar e in 
it, whe ther  the  area is a  sphere, cylinder, or  radiu s. For 
ins ta nce, t he  10-foot radius  of flame strike, which bas a 
dia meter of 20  feet, is expressed as a square t hat is  20 
feet on a  s ide, as s hown in di agram  2.3. Diagram 2.4 
s hows that area w ith tota l cover inside it. 

Cones. A cone  is  represented by rows of tokens on t he 

grid, extending fro m  t he cone's poin t o f origin. In the 
rows, the s quares a re  adjoining s ide  by side or corner  to 
corne r,  as s h own in di agra m  2.5. To determine  the  num-

CHAPTER 2  I  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

ber of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For 
example, a  30-foot cone contains six rows. 

Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square 

adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. 
The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent 
to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, 
place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, 
plus one more token. Place this row's toke ns so that 
their squares each s hare a s ide with a square  in  the 
previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the 
point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the 
row; place it on one end or the other of the  row you just

ENCOUNTER BUILDING 
This section introduces new guidelines o n building com 
bat encounters for an adventure. They are an a lternative 
to the rules in "Creating Encounters" in chapter 3 of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide. This approach uses the same 
math that underlies the rules presented in that book, but 
it makes a few adjustments to the way that math is  pre 
sented to produce a  more flexible system. 

This encou nter-building system assumes that, as DM, 

you want to  have a clear understa nding of the threat 
posed by a group of monsters. It will  be  useful  to you if 
you want to e mphasize combat in your adventure, if you 
want to ens ure  that a foe  is n't too deadly for a group of 
characters, and if you want to understand the relation 
ship between a character's level and a  monster's cha l 
lenge rating. 

Building an encounter using these guidelines follows 

a series of steps. 

STEP l: ASSESS THE  CHARACTERS 
To build an encounter using this system, first take stock 
of the player characters. This system uses the charac 
ters' levels  to determine the numbers and challenge 
ratings of creatures you can pit them against without 
making a fight too hard or too easy. Even though char 
acter level is important, you s hould also take note of 
each character's hit point maximum and saving throw 
modifiers, as well  as how much damage the  mightiest 
cha racters can dea l with a single attack. Character level 
and cha llenge rating a re good for defining the difficu lty 
of an e ncou nter, but they don't tell  the whole story. You'll 
make use of these additional character statistics when 
you select monsters for an encounter in step 4. 

STEP 2:  CHOOSE  ENCOUNTER SIZE 
Determine whether you want to create a battle that pits 
one creature against the characters , or if you want to 
use multiple monsters. If the fight is  against a si ngle 
opponent, your best candidate for that foe is one of the 
game's legendary creatures, which are designed to  fill 
this need. If the battle involves multiple monsters, de 
cide  roughly how many creatures you want to use before 
continuin g with s tep 3. 

STEP 3:  DETERMINE  NUMBERS AND 
CHALLENGE  RATINGS 

T he process for building fights that feature only one leg 
endary monster is simple. T he Solo Monster Challenge 
Rating table shows you which cha llenge rating (CR) to 
use for a legendary creature opposing a  party of four to 
six characters, creating a satisfying but difficult battle. 
For example, for a  party of five  9th-level characters, a 
CR 12 legendary creature makes an optimal encounte r. 
For a more perilous battle, match up the characters 
with a  legendary creature whose cha llenge rating is  1 or 
2 higher than optimal. For an easy fight,  use a legendary 
creatu re whose challenge rating is  3 or more lower than 
the challenge  rating for an optima l encounter.

If your encounter features multiple  monsters, bala nc 
ing it takes a little  more work. Refer to  the Multiple 
Monsters tables, which a re  broken up by level ranges, 
providing information for how to balance encounters fo r 
characters  of 1st-5th level, 6th- 10th level, 11th- 15th 
level, and 16th- 20th level. 

First, you need to  note the challenge rating for each 
creature the party wi ll  face. T hen, to create your encoun 
ter, find  the level of each character on the appropriate ta 
ble. Each table shows what a single character of a given 
level is equivalent to in  terms of challenge rating-a 
value  represented by a  ratio that compa res numbers of 
characters to a single monster ranked by challenge rat 
ing. The first number in each expression is the number 
of characters of the given level. The second number tells 
how many monsters of the listed cha llenge rating those 
characters are equivalent to. 

For example, reading the row for  1st-level ch aracters 

from the  1st- 5th Level table, we see tha t one 1st-level 
character is  the equiva lent of two CR 1/8  monsters or 
one CR  1/4 monster. The ratio reverses for higher c ha l 
lenge r at ings, where a  single monster is more powerful 
than a  single 1st-level cha racter. One CR 1/ 2 creature is 
equivalent to three 1st-level ch aracters, while one CR 1 
opponent is equivalent to five. 

Let's say you have a  party of four 3rd-level characters. 
Using the table, you can see that one  CR 2 foe is a  good 
match for the entire party, but that the characters w ill 
likely h ave a  hard tim e handling a CR 3 creature. 

Using the same guidelines, you can  mix and  match 
c ha llenge ratings to  put togethe r a group of creatures 
to oppose four 3rd-level c haracters. For exam ple, you 
could select one  CR 1 creature. That's worth two 3 rd 
level characters, leaving you with two c ha racters' worth 
of mons ters to allocate. You  could the n add two CR 1/4 
monsters to accou nt for one other ch aracter a nd one CR 
1/2 mons ter to account for the final character. In total, 
you r encou nte r  has one CR 1, one CR 1/2, and two CR 
1/4 creatures. 

For groups  in which the characters a re of different lev 

els, you h ave two options. You can gro up all  characters 
of the same level. together, match them w ith monsters, 
a nd then combine all the c reatures into one encounter. 
Alternatively, you can determine the group's average 
level and treat each c haracter as being o f that level for 
the purpose of selecting appropria te  monsters. 

The above guidelines a re designed to c reate a  fight 
that will challenge a  party while still being winnable. 
If you want to create an easier e ncounter that w ill 
c hallenge ch a racte rs  but not threaten to defeat them, 
you can treat the party as if it were roughly one-third 

smalle r  than it is. For example, to ma ke  an easy e ncoun 
ter for a  party of five ch aracters, put them up against 
monsters  that would be a tough fight for three ch arac 
ters. Likewise, you can  treat the party as up to ha lf again 
la rger to build a  battle t hat is potentially deadly, though 
still  no t li kely to  be an a utomatic defeat. A party of four 
cha racters  facing a n encounte r designed for s ix charac 
ters wou ld fall into this category. 

WEAK MONSTERS AND  HIGH-LEVEL 
CHARACTERS 
To save space on the  tables a nd keep them simple, some 
of the lower cha llenge ratings are missing from the high 
er-level tables. For low challe n ge ratings  not a ppearing 
on the table, assume a  1:12 r atio, indicating that twelve 
c reatures of those ch allenge ratings are equivale nt to 
one c haracter o f a specific level. 

S TEP  4:  SELECT MONSTERS 
After using the tables from t he  previous step to deter 
mine  the challe nge ratings of the monsters in your en 
counter, you're  ready to  pick individual monsters. This 
process is  more of a n art tha n a science. 

In addi tion to assessing mo nste rs  by ch alle nge rating, 

it's important to look a t how certain  monsters might

stack up agai ns t your group. Hit points, attacks, and 
saving th rows are all  usefuJ indicators. Compare the 
damage a  monster can deal to the  hit point maximum of 
each character. Be wary of any monster that is  capable 
of dropping a  character with a single attack, un less you 
are designing the fight to be especially deadly. 

In  the same way, compare the monsters' hit points to 
the damage o utput of the party's strongest characters, 
again looking for targets that can be killed with one 
blow. Having a s ignifica nt number of foes drop in the 
first rounds of combat can make an encounter too easy. 

Likewise, look at whether a  monster's deadliest 
abi li ties call  for saving throws that most of the  party 
members are weak with, and compare the characters' 
offensive abilities to the monsters' saving throws. 

If the on ly creatures you can choose from at the de 
s ired challenge  rating aren't a good match for the char 
acters' statistics, don't be afraid to go back to step 3. By 
altering your challenge  rating targets and adjusting the 

number of creatures in  the encounter, you can come up 
with different optio ns  for building the e ncounter. 

STEP 5: Ann FLAVOR 
The events that unfold during an encou nter have to do 
with a lot more than swinging weapons a nd casting 
spells . The most interesting confrontations also take 
into account the  personality or behavior of the monsters, 
perhaps determining whether they can be communi 
cated with or whether they're a ll  acting in concert. Other 
possible factors include the nature of the physical envi 
ronment, such as whether it includes obstacles or other 
features that might come into play, and the ever-present 
possibility of something unexpected taking place. 

If you al ready have ideas for how to  flesh out your 
encounter in  these ways, go right a head and finish your 
cr eation. Otherwise, take a look at the following sec 
tions for some basic advice on adding flavor elements to 
the simple  mechanics of the fight. 

CHAPTER 2  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

MONSTER P ERSONALITY 
To address the question of a  monster's personality, you 
ca n use  the tables in chapter  4 of the Dungeon  Master's 
Guide, use the  Monster Personality table below, or s im 
ply jot down a  few notes based on a  creature's Monster 
Manual description. During the b a ttle, you can use these 
ideas to inform how you portray the monsters a nd their 
actions. To keep things  s imple, you can assign the same 
personality traits to a n entire group of monsters. For ex 
ample, one band it gang mi ght be a n unruly mob of brag 
ga rts, while  the members of another gang are a lways on 
edge and ready to flee a t the first sign of danger.

Do riva lries, h a treds, or attachments exist among the 
monsters  in an encounte r? I.f so, you can use s uch  re 
lationships  to inform the monste rs' be havior during 
combat. The death of a  much-revered leader might 
throw its followers  into a fren zy.  On the other ha nd, a 
monster might decide  to flee if its s pouse is killed, or a 
mistreated toady might be eager  to s urrende r a nd b etray

TERRAIN AND  TRAPS 
A few ele ments that make  a  battlefield som e thing other 
than a  large a rea of flat ground can go a  long way to 
ward spicing up a n e ncounte r. Consider setting your e n 
counte r in an area that wou ld provide c halle nges even if 
a  fight were  not taking place the re. What potentia l perils 
or other features might draw the  characters' attention, 
eithe r  before or during the fight? Why are monsters lurk 
ing in  this a rea to begin with-does it offer good hiding 
places, for instance? 

To add deta ils to a n encounter area at random, look to 
the  tables in appendix A of the Dungeon Master's Guide 
to de te rmine  room and area features, p ote ntial hazards, 
obstacles, traps, a nd more. 

RANDOM EVENTS 
Consider what might ha ppe n in an  encounte r a rea if the 
characte rs were to ne ver enter it. Do the  guards serve in 
s hifts ? What other characters or monsters might visit? 
Do c reatures gathe r there to eat or gossip? Are the re 
any natural phenomena-such as strong winds, earth 
tremors, or rain squa lls-that sometimes take place 
in the a rea? Random events ca n add a fun element of 
th e  unexpected to a n e ncounter. Just when you think 
a  fight's outcome is evide nt, an unforeseen event can 
make things  more compelling. 

A number of the  tables  in the Dungeon Master's Guide 
can s uggest random  events. The  tables used for e ncoun 
ter location, weird  locales, and wilderness weather in 
chapter 5 of that book are a good s ta rting point for out 
door e ncounte rs. The tables in a ppendix A can  be  useful 
for indoor and outdoor e ncounte rs-esp ecially the tables 
for obstacles, traps, and tricks. Finally,  consult the ra n  
dom e ncounte r tables in the n ext section of t his  book for 
inspiration. 

QUICK MATCHUPS 

The guidelines above assume that you a re con cerned 
about balance in your combat encounters and h ave 
enough time to prepare them. If you don't h ave much 
time, or if you want s imple r  but less precise guidelines, 
the  Quick Matchups table below offers an alternative. 
This table gives you a way to match a characte r of 
a certain level with a numbe r of monsters. The table 
lists the challenge ratings  to  use for including one, two, 
and four monsters pe r cha racter  for each level. For in 
s tance, looking at the 3rd-level e ntry on the table, you 
can see that a  CR 1/2 monster is equivalent to one 3rd 
level ch a racter, as are two CR 1/4  mons ter s a nd four 
CR  1/8  ones.

CHAPTER 2  I  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS

RANDOM  ENCOUNTERS: 
A WORLD  OF POSSIBILITIES 
Chapte r 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide  provides guid 
ance o n us ing ra ndom encounters in your ga me. This 
section  builds o n that guida nce, offering a host of ran 
dom encounte r tables for you to use w he n you dete rmine 
that a  ra ndo m encounter is going to  ta ke  place. 

Using the  mo ns te r lists  in appendi x B of tha t book as 
a  basis, we've  built a set of tables  for each environme nt 
category: arctic, coas ta l, desert, fo rest, grassla nd, hill, 
mo unta in, swa mp, Underdark, underwa ter, a nd  u rba n. 
Within each category, sepa rate  tables a re  provided  for 
each of the fo ur tiers  of play: levels  1- 4, 5- 10, 11- 16, 
and 17-20. 

Eve n though you ca n use these tables "out of the box," 

the advice in the Dungeon Master's Guide s till  holds 
true:  tailoring s uch tables to you r ga me ca n re inforce 
the  themes and flavor of your campaign. We e ncourage 
you to customize this  ma te ria l to ma ke it your own. 

In the  tables, a name in bold refers  to a stat block in 

the Monster Manual. 

FLIGHT,  OR FIGHT,  OR 

? 

Each of the  results  on these tables represents a certa in 
kind of cha llenge or potentiaJ cha llenge. 

If yo u let the dice have their way a nd the result is  a 
large number of mons ters, the generated encounte r 
might be  too difficult or d angerous  for the characters  in 
their present circums ta nces. T hey might wa nt to flee to 
avoid contact, or no t to approach a ny closer after per 
ceiving the  monsters  from a dista nce. 

Of course, you also have the freed om to adjus t the 
numbers, but it's importa nt to remember that not every 
e ncounter involving a  mons ter needs  to result in  combat. 
An encounter might indeed be the prelude  to a battle, 
a  pa rley, or some other interaction. W hat happens  next 
depends  on w hat the cha racte rs  try, or w hat you decide 
is  bound to occur. 

T he  tables also include entries fo r w hat the Dungeon 

Master's Guide calls  "encounters of a  less monstrous 
natu re." Ma ny of these results  cr y out to be cus to mized 
o r d etai led, which o ffers you a n opportunity to connect 
them to the s tory of your campaign. And in so doing, 
you've  taken a s tep towa rd  ma king your ow n persona l

TRAPS  REVISITED 
The ruJes for traps in the Dungeon Master's Guide pro 
vid e the basic information you need to manage traps 
at the gam e table. The material here takes a  different, 
more  elaborate approach- d escribing traps in terms of 
their game mechanics and offering guidance on c reating 
traps o f you r own using these new rules. 

Rather than characterize tr aps as mechanical or magi 
cal, these  rules sepa rate  traps into two other categories: 
s imple  and complex. 

A simple trap activates and is  thereafter harm less or 
easily avoided. A hidden pit dug a t the e ntra nce of a 
goblin lair, a  poison needle  that pops from a  lock, and 
a  crossbow rigged to fire whe n an intruder s teps on a 
pressure plate are all simple  traps. 

ELEMENTS OF A  SIMPLE TRAP 
The description of a s imple  trap begins with a  line  that 
gives the t rap's  level and the severity of the threat it 
poses. Following a general note on w hat the trap looks 
like and how it functions are three paragraphs that tell 
how the  trap works in the game. 

Level and Threat. A trap's  level is actua lly a range of 

levels, equivale nt to one of the tiers of play (levels 1- 4, 
5- 10, 11-16, and 17- 20), indicating the appropriate time 
to use the trap in your campaign. Additiona lly, each trap 
poses either a  moderate, da ngerous, or deadly threat, 
based on its  particular d e ta ils. 

Trigger. A s imple  trap activates when an event occurs 

tha t trigge rs  it. This entry in a trap's description gives 

the  location of the  trigger and the activity t hat causes 
the trap to activate. 

Effect. A trap's effect occurs after it activates. The 
trap might fire a dart, unleash a cloud o f poison gas, 
cause a  bidden enclosure to open, and so on. This en 
try specifies what the trap targets, its attack bonus or 
saving throw DC, and what happe ns on a  hit or a failed 
saving throw. 

Countermeasures. Traps can be detected or defeated 

in a variety of ways by usi ng ability checks o r m agic. 
This entry in a  trap's description gives the means for 
counteracting the trap. It also specifies w hat happens, if 
anything, on a failed attempt to disable it. 

RUNNING A  SIMPLE TRAP 
To prepare for us ing a si mple  trap in play, start by mak 
ing note  of the characters' passive W isdom (Perception) 
scores. Most traps allow Wisdom (Perception) checks 
to detect their triggers or other elements that can tip off 
their presence. If you stop to ask players for this infor 
mation , they might suspec t a  hidden danger. 

When a  trap is triggered, apply its effects as specified 

in  its description. 

If t he c haracters discover a trap, be open  to adjudicat 
ing  their ideas for defeating it. The trap's  description is 
a  starting point for countermeasu res, rather than a com 
plete definition. 

To make it easier for you to describe what happens 
next, the  players s hould be specific about how they want 
to defeat the trap. Simply s ta ting the desire to make a 
check isn't helpfu l for you. Ask the p layers where their 
characte rs  are positioned and what they intend to do to 
defeat the trap. 

FALLING PORTCULLIS 
Simple trap (Jevel 1- 4, moderate threat) 

Some folk who build dungeons, s uch as mad wizards 
in search of new victims, have no intention of a llowing 
their vis itors  to ma ke an easy escape. A fa lling portcullis 
trap can be especially devious ii it causes a portcullis 
to drop som e dis tance away from  the pressure plate 
that activates the trap. Although the  trap is deep in the 
dungeon, the portcullis  closes off the dungeon entrance, 
which is  hundreds of fee t away, meaning that adventur 
ers don't know they are  trapped until they decide to head 
for the exit. 

Trigger. A creature  that s teps on the pressure  plate 

triggers the trap. 

Effect. An  iron portcullis  drops from the ceiling, 

blocking an exit or a  passageway. 

Countermeasures. A successful  DC 20 Wis dom (Per 
ception) check r eveals  the pressure  plate. A successful 
DC 20 Dexterity check us ing thieves' tools disables it, 
and a check with a  tota l of 5 or lower triggers the trap. 

FIERY BLAST 
Simple trap (level 5- 10, dangerous threat) 

The temple of Pyremius, a god of fire,  is  threatened by 
thieves who seek to steal the fire opa ls  dis played there 
by the  priests in tribute to their god. A mosaic o n the 
floor of the entryway to the  inner sanctum delivers a 
fiery rebuke to intruders. 

Trigger. Anyone w ho steps o n the mosaic causes fire 
to erupt from it. Those who openly wear holy symbols of 
Pyremius don't trigger this trap. 

Effect. A 15-foot cube of fire erupts , covering the pres 

sure  plate and the area around it. Each creature in the 
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
24 (7d6) fire damage on a  failed save, or ha lf as much 
da mage on a s uccessful  one. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 15 Wis dom 

(Perception) check reveals  the presence of ash and faint 
bu rn marks in the area affected by this  trap. A success 
ful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check enables a crea 
ture to destroy the  trap by defacing a  key rune on the 
perimeter of the  mosaic that is  withi n reach;  failing this 
check causes the trap to activate. A s uccessfu l dispel 
magic (DC 15) cast on  the runes destroys the trap. 

NET TRAP 
Simple  trap (level l-4, dangerous threat) 

Goblins, with their propens ity to ens lave  their enemies, 
prefer traps that leave intruders  intact so the victims  can 
be  put to work in the  mines or elsewher e. 

MAKING TRAPS  MEANIN G FUL 
If you want to improve the cha nce that the characters  will 
come up against the tra ps you've set for them in an en 
counter or an adventure,  it can  be tempting to use a large 
number of traps. Doing so ensures that the characters will 
have to deal with at  least one or two of them, but  it's  bette r 
to fight that urge. 

If your encounters or adventures are sown with  too 
many traps, and if the characters are victimized over and 
over again as a  result, they a re  likely to take steps to pre 
vent further bad th ings from  happening.  Because of their 
recent experience, the characters ca n become overly cau 
tious, and you  run  the risk of the action grind ing to a  halt 
as the players search every square inch of the dungeo n for 
trip wires and pressure pl ates. 

Traps  are most effective when their presence comes  as a 
s urprise, not when they  appear so often that the characters 
s pend all  their effort watching out for  the next o ne. 

EXAMPLE SIMPLE TRAPS 

The following simple traps can be used to  populate your 
adventures o r as models for your own cr eations . 

BEAR TRAP 
Simple  trap (level 1- 4, dangerous threat) 

A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs 
shut when s tepped on, clamping dow n on a creature's 
leg. The trap is  s piked in the ground, leaving the victim 
immobilized. 

Trigger. A cr eature  that steps on the bear trap 

triggers  it. 

Effect. T he  trap makes a n attack against the  trigger 
ing creature. The attack has a +8  attack bonus  and deals 
5 (ldlO) piercing damage on a  hit. This attack can't gai n 
advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap 
has its speed  reduced  to 0. It can't move until it breaks 
free of the  trap, which requires a s uccessful DC 15 
Strength check by the creature or another creature adja 
cent to the trap. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 10 Wisdom 

(Perception) check reveals  the  trap. A s uccessful DC  10 
Dexterity check us ing thieves' tools disables it. 

CROSSBOW TRAP 
Simple trap (Jevel l -4, dangerous threat) 

The crossbow trap is a  favorite of kobolds  a nd other 
creatures that rely on traps  to defend their lairs. It 
cons ists of a  trip wire strung across a  ha llway and con 
nected to a  pair of hidden  heavy crossbows. The cross 
bows  are aimed to fire down the  hallway at anyone  who 
disturbs  the  trip wire. 

Trigger. A creature  that walks  through the trip wire 

triggers the trap. 

Effect. The trap ma kes two a ttacks  against the  trig 
gering creature. Each a ttack has a +8  attack bonus a nd 
deals  5 (ldlO) pie rcing da mage on a  hi t. This  attack 
can't gain advantage or disadvantage. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessfu l DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check reveals  the trip wire. A s uccessful 
DC 15 Dexte rity check using thieves' tools disables the 
trip wire, a nd a check with a  total of 5 or lower trig 
gers the  trap. 

CHAPTER 2  I DUNGEON  MASTER' S TOOLS 

Trigger. A trip wire strung across a  hallway is  rigged 
to a  la rge net. If the  trip wire  is  broke n, t he  net fa lls on 
intruders. An iron bell is als o rigged to t he  trip wire. It 
rings whe n the tra p activates, alerting nearby gua rds. 
Effect. A net cover ing a  10-foot-by-10-foot a rea cen 
te red on the trip w ire  fal ls  to the  floor as a  bell rings. 
Any creature  fully with in t his  a rea must s ucceed on a 
DC  15 Dex te rity saving throw or be  restra ined . A crea 
ture can use its actio n to make a D C 10 S treng th check 
to try to free itself or a nother creature  in  the net. Deal 
ing 5 s lashin g damage to t he  net (AC 10, 20  hp) a lso 
frees a creature without ha rmi ng the  creature. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful D C 15 Wis dom (P e r 

ception) check reveals  the  trip wire and the  net. A s uc 
cessful  DC 15 D exterity check using thieves' tools  dis 
a bles the  trip w ire w ithout caus ing the net to drop or the 
bell  to ring; failin g the check causes the t rap to activate . 

PITTRAP 
S imple trap (level 1- 4, moderate threat) 

The simplest of pit tra ps consis ts  of a  10-foot-deep bo le 
in  the  floor, concealed  by tatte red canvas that's covered 
with leaves and di rt to look like solid gro und. T his type 
of tra p is  useful  fo r  blocking off the entra nce to a  mon 
ster la ir, a nd usually has narrow led ges a long its  sides to 
allow for move ment around it. 

Trigger. Anyone who s te ps o n the canvas mi ght fall 

into the  pit. 

Effect. The  trigger ing creature  mus t ma ke a D C 10 
Dexte rity saving throw. On a s uccessful save, the crea 
ture catches itself on the  pit's edge o r ins tinctively s te ps 
back. On a  failed s ave, the creature fa lls into the  pit and 
takes 3 (ld6) bludgeoning damage  from  the fall. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC  10 Wis do m (Pe r 

ception) check reveals  the  presence of the canvas and 
the  1-foot-w ide  ledge a round the edges of t he  pit whe re it 
is safe to t ravel. 

P OISON  NEEDLE 
Simple trap (level 1-4, deadly threat) 

A tiny, poisoned needle hidde n in a  lock is a good way 
to discourage thieves fro m  plunde ring a hoard. S uch 
a  tra p is  us ua lly put in a chest or in the door  to a  trea 
s ure cha mbe r. 

Trigger. Anyone attempting to pick or open the  lock 

trigge rs  the  trap. 

Effect. T he triggering creature must mak e a D C 20 
Cons titution saving throw. On a  failed save, the creature 
ta kes 14 (4d6) pois on da mage  and is  poisoned for 10 
minutes. While poisoned in this way, the creature  is  pa r 
a lyzed . On a s uccessful save, the creature  ta kes ha lf as 
much da mage a nd is n't poisoned. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 20 Wis do m (Pe r 
ception) check reveals  the  needle, but only if a cha racter 
ins pects  the  lock. A s uccessful DC 20  Dexte rity check 
us ing thieves' tools  disables  the needle, a nd a check 
with a  tota l o f 10 or lowe r trigge rs  the  tra p. 

S CYT H I NG B LA DE 
S imple trap  (level 5 - 10, dangerous threat) 
This  tra p uses moving  blades th at sweep down through 
a chamber, threatening a nyone nearby. Typically, a 
scythi ng blade tra p is activated by ma n ipulating a  leve r 
or some othe r s imple device. Kobolds especially like this 
ki nd of trap, since it can take down bigger creatures. 

Trigger. When the  lever is  pulled, the tra p activates. 
Effect. E ach Medium or la rger creature in a 5 -foot 
w ide, 20 -foot-lon g a rea mus t ma ke a D C 15 Dexte rity 
saving throw, ta king  14 (4d6) s lashing da mage on a 
failed s ave, or h alf as much da mage on a s ucces s ful  one. 
Countermeasures. The  lever is n't hidde n. A success 

ful  DC 15 Wis dom (Pe rception) check involving the 
s urfaces in the  trap's a rea of e ffect reveals scra pe ma rks 
a nd bloodstains on the wa lls  and floor. A s uccessful 
DC 15 D exterity check us ing thieves' tools dis ables 
th e  leve r. 

SLEE P  OF A GES 
Simple trap (level 11- 16, deadly  threat) 

When a s leep of ages trap activates, a  pressure  plate 
unleashes a s pell  that threate ns  to send intrude r s into a 
deep s lum be r. The dungeon's  gua rdia ns  can the n more 
easily dispose of the s leepe rs. 

Trigger. Ste pping on t he  pressure plate trigge rs 

this  tra p. 

Effect. Whe n activated,  this  tra p casts a sleep s pell 

cente red on t he press ure plate, using a 9 th-level 
s pell s lot. 

Countermeasures. A s uccessful DC 2 0 Wisdom (Per 
ception) check reveals  the  pressure  plate. A s uccessful 
DC 20 Intelligen ce (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of 
the  pressure  plate  disables the  trap, a nd a  check with a 
tota l o f 10 or lower triggers  it. A s uccessful dispel magic 
(DC 19) cast oo the pressure  plate destroys the trap. 

DESIGNING SIMPLE TRA PS 

~~~~~~~~~ 

Yo u can create your own s imple tra ps  by using the fol 
low ing guidelines. You can a lso adapt t he example  traps 
for diffe rent levels a nd seve rity of threat by modifying 
th eir D Cs and damage values as s hown below. 

P URPOSE 
Before diving into the deta ils  of your trap, think about 
its  reason for being. Why would someone build s uch a 
trap? What is  its  purpose? Cons ide r the trap's creator (in 
the  adventure),  the creator's purpose, a nd the  location 
the  tra p protects. Tra ps  have context in the  world- they 
a re n't created for no reas on-and that context drives the 
trap's nature and e ffects . 

D escribed  below a re a  few of the gene ra l purposes a 
trap might have . Use them  to ins pire  the creation o f your 
ow n traps. 

Alarm. An al arm tra p is designed to a lert an area's 
occupants  of intrude rs. It might cause a  bell  or a gong 
to s ound. This type of trap ra rely involves a s aving 
throw, beca use the a larm can't be  avoided whe n the 
trap go es off. 

Delay. Some  traps are  designed to s low down ene 
mies, giving a dungeon's inha bitants  time  to mount a 

CHAPTER 2  I  DUNGEON  M AST ER' S TOOLS 

L EVEL  AN D  L ETH A L ITY 
Before creating a trap's e ffects, think about its  level and 
its letha lity. 

Traps a re divided  into fou r level ra nges: 1-4, 5 - 10, 
11- 16, and 17-20. T he  level you choose fo r a  trap gives 
you a s ta rting point for determin ing its potency. 
To further deli neate the  trap's  str e ng th, decide 

w hether it is a  mode rate, da ngerous, or dead ly threat to 
cha racters  in its  leve l range. A mode rate trap is unlikely 
to kill  a cha racter. A d a ngero us  trap typically deals 
eno ugh dama ge  that a cha racter hit by o ne  is  eager for 
healing. A deadly trap might red uce a creature  to 0  hit 
points in one s hot, and leaves most cr eatures hit by it in 
need of a s hort o r long rest. 

Cons ult the  following tables w hen determining a 
trap's e ffects. The Trap Save DCs a nd Attack Bo nus es 
table provides guideli nes for a  t rap's saving th row DC, 
check DC, a nd attack bon us . T he check DC is  the defaul t 
fo r a ny check used  to  interact w ith  the trap. 

The  Da mage Sever ity by Level table  lists the typical 

damage a  t rap dea ls  at cer tai n cha racter levels. The 
damage values given assume that the  trap da mages one 
creature . Use d6s for d amage in place of dlOs  fo r traps 
that can a ffect more than o ne creature at a  time. 

T he S pell E quiva lent by Level table s hows  the s pell 
s lot level that is a ppropriate  fo r a given cha racter level 
a nd the severity of da nger posed by the trap. A s pell is a 
great foundation to use as th e design of a  trap, whethe r 
the  trap duplicates the s pe ll (a mirror that casts charm 
p er son on whoever looks  into it) or uses its effects  (an 
alchem ical device th at explo des like a fir eball). 

The Deadly entry fo r characters of 17th level or higher 
suggests combining a 9th-level a nd a  5th-level spell  into 
one e ffect. In this case, pick two s pe lls, or combine  the 
effects of a s pe ll cast using a  9 th-level a nd a  5th-level 
slot. For instance, a fir eball spell of this sort would deal 
24d6  fire damage on a  failed saving throw.

defense or  flee. The  hidden pit is  a classic example of 
this kind of trap. A 10-foot-deep pit usua lly deals  little 
da mage and is  easy to escape, but it serves its  purpose 
by impeding intruders. Other examples of delaying traps 
include collaps ing wa lls, a  portcullis  that d rops  from the 
ceiling, a nd a locking mechanis m  that shuts a nd ba rs 
a  door. If a d elaying trap has  moving pa rts  that directly 
threaten cha racte rs when they operate, the cha racters 
a re  us ually requ ired to ma ke  Dexterity saving throws to 
avo id  ha rm. 

R estrain. A restra ining trap tries to keep its  victims  in 
place, leavin g them  u na ble  to move. S uch traps  are ofte n 
e mployed  in conjunction with r egular gua rd patrols, so 
that victims  a re period ica lly ex tricated a nd ta ken away 
to be dealt with. But in an a ncient du ngeon, the g uards 
migh t be long gone. 

Restra ining traps  us ua lly req uire a s uccessful 
S tre ng th s aving th row to be avoided, but some  don't 
a llow saving throws. Io add ition to dealing dam age, a 
restra ining trap a ls o renders a  creatu re unable to move. 
Ma king a s ubsequent s uccessful S trength check (us ing 
the  tra p's savin g throw DC) or dealing d am age aga inst 
the  tra p can  break it a nd free  the captive. Examples in 
clude a  bear trap, a cage that drops  from a ceiling,  a nd a 
device tha t flings a  net. 

S lay. Some  traps  are designed to eliminate intrud 
e rs, pla in and s imple. Their effects include  po isoned 
need les that s pring o ut when a lock is  ta mpered with, 
blasts of fire  that fill  a  room , pois on gas, a nd o ther 
letha l measures. Savi ng throws-us ua lly Dexteri ty or 
Cons titution- allow cr eatures to avoid or m itigate  the 
trap's effects . 

CHAPTER  2  I DUNC EON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

TRIGGERS 
A trigge r  is the circ umstance that needs  to take place to 
activate the trap. 

Decide what causes the trap to activate and d etermine 

how the  ch a racters can find the trigger. He re are some 
example trigge rs: 

A pressure plate that, when it is  stepped o n , acti 
vates the tra p 

•  A trip wire that springs a  trap w hen it is  broken, us u 

a lly when someone walks through it 

•  A doorknob tha t activates a trap when it is  turned 

the wrong way 

•  A door or chest that trigger s a  trap when it is  opened 

A trigger usually needs to be hidde n  to be e ffective. Oth 
e rwise, avoiding the trap is usually easy. 

A trigger requires a Wisdom (P e rcept io n) c heck if 
s imply s potting it reveals  its  nature. The c haracte rs can 
foi l a  pit trap hidden by a  leaf-covered  net if t hey s pot the 
pit through a gap in the leaves. A trip wire is  foiled if it is 
s potted, as is a  pressure  plate. 

Oth er traps  require careful inspection and deduction 
to notice. A doorknob opens a  door when turned to the 
left, but activates a  tra p whe n turned  to  the right. Such a 
subtle  trap requires a successful Intelligence (Investiga 
tion) c heck to notice. The trigger is obvious. Understand 
ing its  na ture  is  not. 

The  DC of the check,  regardless of its  type, depends 

on the s kill and care  take n to conceal the trap. Most 
traps can be detected with a successfu l DC 20 check, 
but a  crudely made or has tily built trap has a D C of 15. 
Exceptionally devious  traps might have a D C of 25. 

You must then put some thought into what t he c har 
acters learn with a  s uccessful check. In most cases, the 
ch eck reveals the t rap. In other cases, it uncovers clues, 
but foiling the t rap still requires some d eduction. The 
characters might s ucceed on the check but s till trigger 
the trap if they don't unde rs tand w hat they h ave learned. 

EFFECTS 
Designing a  tra p's effects is a  straightforward process. 
The  tables for saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, dam 
age, and the like give you a starting point for most s im 
ple  traps that deal damage. 

For traps with more  complex e ffects, your best s tart 
ing point is  to use the Spell Equivale nt by Level table to 
find  the best matc h for you r  trap's inte nded effect. Spells 
a re a good starting point because they are compact 
pieces of game design that deliver specific effects. 

If you are us ing a spell  as a starting point, check to see 
if you need to tweak its effects to fit  the trap's  nature. For 
instance, you can easily change  the d a m age type a sp ell 
delivers or the saving throw it requires. 

DISARMING  A  SIMPLE TRAP 
Only one successful ability check is required  to dis arm 
a s imple trap. Imagine how your tra p operates, and then 
think about how  the c haracters could overcome it. More 
than one kind of ability c heck might be  possible. S ome 
traps are so poorly concealed that they can be discov 
e red or circumvented without active e ffort.  For instance, 
a hidde n pit trap is  effectively disarmed as soon  as the 

cha racters notice it. After that, they can simply walk 
a round it, o r they can climb down one side, walk across 
t he bottom  of the pit, a nd climb up the other side. 

Once you determine  how a  t rap can be disarmed or 

avoided, decide  the appropriate ability a nd skill  com 
binations that characters can  use . A Dexterity check 
us ing  thieves' tools, a Stre ngth (Athletics) c heck, and a n 
Intelligence (Arcana) check are a ll  commonly used for 
this  purpose . 

A D exterity check using thieves' tools can apply to any 

trap that has a  mechanical element. Thieves' tools can 
be  used to disable a  trip w ire or a  pressure plate, disas 
semble a  poison needle mechan ism, or clog a va lve that 
lea ks  poisonous gas into a  room. 

A Strength check is often the  me thod for t hwarting 
tra ps  that can be destroyed or prevented fro m operating 
thro ugh the use of brute force. A scything  blade can b e 
broken, a s liding  block can be held  in place, or a  net can 
be torn apart. 

A magic trap can be disabled by someone who can 
unde rmine the  magic used to  power it. Typically, a s uc 
cessfu l Intelligence (A rcana) check en ables a cha racter 
to figure out how a magic trap functions a nd how to ne 
gate its effect. For instance, the character could  discover 
t hat a  statue  that belches a jet of magical flame can be 
disabled by s hattering one of its glass eyes. 

Once you k now what kind of c heck is called for, you 
then determine w hat happens on a fa iled a ttempt to dis 
a ble  the trap. Depending on the kind of check involved 
and the  nature of t he  tra p, you might determine that any 
fa iled c heck has negative consequences- usually involv 
ing the  trigge ring of the t rap. At other times, you could 
assig n a  numbe r t hat the check must exceed to prevent 
the trap from going off. If the total of the c heck is equal 
to or lowe r  tha n that number, the trap activates. 

PLACING A  SIMPLE TRAP 
Context and e nvironme nt a re critical when it comes 
to prope rly locating a t rap. A swingin g log tra p that's 
mea nt to knock cha racters aside  is a  mere inconve 
nience on a  typical forest path , whe re  it can be easily 
circ umvented. But it's a  potentially deadly haza rd on a 
narrow trail that hugs t he s ide of a  towering cliff face. 
Choke  points and narrow passages that lead  to im 
portant places in a dungeon a re good spots for traps, 
especially those that serve as alarm s or restraints. The 
goa l is  to foil  or  delay intruders before they can  reach a 
c ritical location, giving the dungeon's denizens a chance 
to mount a  defe n se or a  counterattack. 

A treasure c hest, a  door leading to a vault,  or any other 

obstacle 'or contai ner that bars the way to a va luable 
treasure is the  ideal location for a  slaying trap. In s uch 
insta nces, the trap is  the last line of defense against a 
thief or intrude r. 

Alarm traps, s ince they pose no direct phys ical 

threat, are appropriate for a reas that are a lso used  by 
a dungeon 's denizens-assuming the residents know 
about the trap a nd how to avoid setting it off. Accidents 
can happen , but if a  goblin stumbles inside its den and 
activates an a larm  trap, there's no real harm done. The 
a larm sounds, the  guards arrive, they punish the clumsy 
goblin, and they reset the trap. 

CHAPTER 2  I  DUNC EON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

COMPLEX TRAPS 

A complex trap poses multiple dangers to adventurers. 
After a complex trap activates, it remains dangerous 
round after round until the characters avoid it or disable 
it. Some complex traps become more dangerous over 
time, as they accumulate power or gain speed. 

Complex traps are also more difficult to disable than 
simple ones. A single check is not enough. Instead, a  se 
ries of checks is required to s lowly disengage the trap's 
components. The trap's  effect degrades with each suc 
cessful check until the characters finally deactivate it. 

Most complex traps are designed so that they can be 
disarmed only by someone who is exposed to the trap's 
effect. For example,  the mechanism that controls  a  hall 
way filled with scything blades is on the opposite e nd 
from the entrance, or a  statue that bathes an area in ne 
crotic energy can be disabled only by someone standing 
in the affected area. 

DESCRIBING A  COMPLEX TRAP 
A complex trap has all the elements of a simple  trap, 
plus special characteristics that make the trap a  more 
dynamic threat. 

Level and Threat. A complex trap uses the same level 

and severity designations that a simple trap does. 

Trigger. Just like a  simple trap, a  complex trap has a 

trigger. Some complex traps have multiple triggers. 

Initiative. A complex trap takes turns as a creature 
does, because it functions over a  period of time. Thjs 
part of a  trap's description tells whether the trap is  slow 
(acts on initiative count 10), fast (acts on initiative count 
20), or very fast (acts on initiative count 20 and also ini 
tiative count 10). A trap always acts after creatures that 
have the same initiative count. 

Active Elements. On a  trap's turn, it produces specific 

effects that are detailed in this part of its description. 
The trap might have multiple active e lements, a  table 
you roll on to determine its effect at random, or options 
for you to choose from. 

Dynamic Elements. A dynamic element is a  threat 
that arises or evolves while the trap functions. Usually, 
changes involving dramatic elements take effect at the 
end of each of the trap's  turns or in  response to the char 
acters' actions. 

Constant Elements. A complex trap poses a  threat 

even when it is not taking its turn. The constant ele 
ments describe how these parts of the trap function. 
Most make an attack or force a saving throw against any 
c reature that ends its turn within a certain area. 

Countermeasures. A trap can be defeated in a variety 
of ways. A trap's  description details the checks or spells 
that can detect or dfaable it. It also specifies what hap 
pens, if anything, on a  failed attempt to disable it. 

Disabling a complex trap is like disarming a simple 
trap, except that a complex trap requires more checks. 
It typically takes three successful checks to disable 
one of a  complex trap's  elements. Many of these traps 
have multiple elements, requiring a lot of work to shut 
down every part of the trap. Usually, a successful check 
reduces a  trap element's effectiveness even if it doesn't 
disable the trap. 

CHAPTER 2  I DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

RUNNING A  COMPLEX TRAP 
A complex trap functions in  play much like a  legendary 
monster. When it is activated, the trap's active elements 
act according to its initiative. On each of its initiative 
counts, after a ll  creatures with that same initiative count 
have acted, the trap's  features activate. Apply the effects 
detai led in the trap's description. 

After resolving the effects of the trap's active elements, 

check its dynamic elements to see if anytrung changes 
about the trap. Many complex traps have effects that 
vary during an encounter. A m agical aura might do more 
damage the longer it is active, or a swinging blade might 
change which area of a chamber it attacks. 

The trap's  constant elements a llow it to have effects 
when it isn't the trap's  turn. At the end of each creature's 
turn, look at the trap's  constant elements to see if any of 
their effects are triggered. 

EXPERIENCE  FOR COMPLEX TRAPS 
Overcoming a  complex trap merits an experience point 
award, depending on the danger it poses.judging 
whether a  party has overcome a  trap requires some 
amount of adjudication. As a rule of thumb, if the char 
acters disable a  complex trap or are exposed to its  ef 
fects and survive, award them experience points for the 
effort according to the table  below.

EXAMPLE  COMPLEX TRAPS 

The following complex traps can be used to challenge 
characters or to inspire your own creations. 

PATH  OF BLADES 
Complex trap (level 1-4, dangerous threat) 

Hidden within a  buried pyramid that marks the location 
of the Lost City of Cynidicea is the tomb of King Alexan 
der and Queen Zenobia. The entrance to their tomb is a 
long hallway riddled with traps, accessible only by cun 
ningly hidden secret doors. The hallway is 20 feet wide 
and 160 feet long. It is mostly clear. After 80 feet, the 
floor is broken and cracked, becoming difficult terrain 
until the 130-foot mark. 

Trigger. This trap activates as soon as a non-undead 
c reature enters the hallway, and it remains active wh ile 
any non-undead creature is within the hall. 

Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 20 and ini 

tiative count 10. 

Active Elements. The Path of Blades includes a set of 

whirling blades along the first 80 feet of the trap, crush 
ing pillars that slam down from the ceiling to the floor 
before rising back up to the ceiling in the next 50 feet, 
and a  rune of fear in its final  30 feet. 

Whirling Blades (Initiative 20). The blades attack 

each creature in the first 80 feet of the hallway, with 

a +5  bonus  to  the attack roU and dealing  11 (2dl0) 
s lashing damage on a  hit. 

Crushing Pillars (Initiative 10). Each creature  in  the 
SO-foot-long area b eyond the first 80 feet o f the hall 
way mus t make a  DC  15 Dexte rity saving throw. On 
a  fa iled save, a  creature takes 11  (2d10) bludgeoning 
damage and is  knocked  prone. On a s uccessful save, 
the  creature  takes half as m uch damage and is n't 
knoc ked  prone. 

Rune of Fear (Initiative 10). Each creature  in  the 

30-foot-long a rea beyond the  Crushing Pilla rs  mus t 
make  a DC 15 Wis dom saving throw. On a  fa iled 
saving  throw, the  creature  becomes frighte ned  by 
the  rune, a nd it mus t immediately use its  reaction 
to move its s peed in the direction of the  pilla rs. The 
frighte ned c reature  can't move closer to the  far end 
of the h allway until it uses its action to make  a DC 
15 Wis do m saving throw, which end s  the frighten ed 
condit ion on itself on a s uccess. 

Dynamic Elements. The blades and the rune become 

more da ngerous  the longer the  tra p remains active. 

Blades Accelerate. The blades move with inc reasing 
s peed, s lowing only whe n they hit a  ta rget. Each 
time  the  blades  miss with an attack, the ir next at 
tack becomes harde r  to avoid. After each miss, the 
blades ' a ttack bonus inc reases by 2, a nd their d am 
age increases by 3 (ld6). These be nefits a pply until 
the blades hit a  target, afte r w hic h the values return 
to normal. 

Rune's Defense. Tampering with the Rune of Fea r in 
creases the trap's powe r. Eac h s uccessful  check on 
a n a tte mpt to dis able t he  run e increases the da mage 
of the  blad es a nd the c rushing  pillars by 5 (ldlO) 
a nd inc reases the rune's saving  t h row DC by 1. 

Constant Elements. T he Whirling Blades and the 
Rune of Fear a ffect each crea ture  that e nds  its turn in 
a n a rea affected by these e le me nts. 

Whirling Blades. Any c reature that e nd s its turn in 
the  blades' area is  targeted  by an attack:  +5 attack 
bon us; 5 (ldlO) s las hing damage on a  hit. 

Rune of Fear. Any c reature  that e nds  its  turn within 
30 feet of the fa r e nd of the corridor  must ma ke  a 
saving throw agains t the Rune of Fear effect. 

Countermeasures. Each of the  trap's active ele me nts 

can  be thwarted  by particula r counte rmeasures. 

Whirling Blades. C ha rac te rs  ca n s m ash t he  blad es, 

da mage their compon ents, or discern how to 
avoid  them. The  blades are disabled if the ir attack 
bonus is  reduced to -8. Ways to reduce it are de 
scribed below. 

Intelligence (In vestigation), D C 15. As an action, a 

c reature  that can see the  blades ca n a ttempt an In 
telligence (Investigation) check. A s uccessful  check 
mea ns  that the c ha rac ter bas learned how to antici 
pate t he  blades' move ment, imposi ng disadva ntage 
on the blades' attacks  agains t the c reature while it 
is n't incapacitated. 

Attack. A cr eature in the  a rea can ready a n attack to 
s trike at one of t he  blades as it goes by. The blade 

gai ns  advantage on its attack against the c reature. 
The creature  then attacks. Each blade  has AC 15 
a nd 15 hit points. Destroying a  blade reduces the 
Whirling Blades attack bonus  by 2 . 

Dexterity check using thieves' tools, DC 15. Creatures 
can use thieves' tools in t he a rea a ttacked  by the 
blades to  foil  their mecha nis m. A successful  ch eck 
reduces the Whirling Blades a ttack bonus  by 2. 

Crushing Pillars. The pillars are not s usceptible to 

countermeasures. 

Rune of Fear. T he  rune  can be d isabled with three 
s uccessful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks. 
Each ch eck requires an action. A c reature m ust be 
at the e nd of the ha llway to attempt the check, and 
only one  creature can work o n this task at once. 
Once a  c reature  attempts a  ch eck for this purpose, 
no other cha racter can do so until  the e nd of tha t 
creature's next turn. Alternatively, the  rune ca n be 
disabled w ith t hree successful  castings of dispel 
magic (DC 13) targeting  the rune. 

SPHERE OF  CRUSHING D OOM 
Complex.trap (level 5- 10, deadly threat) 

The court j ester devised a d ead ly trap to foil  anyone who 
soug ht  to steal h is  magic fool's cap. The jester's tomb 
is located at the end of a  10-foot-wide, 150-foot-long 
hallway that descends sharply from north to south. The 
entrance to the tom b is a  door on the eastern wall at the 
bottom of th e s lope, at the south e nd of the  hall. 

Trigger. T his trap activates as soon as th e door lead 
ing  to the jester's coffin is  opened. A magic portal opens 
at the  northern end of the ha ! I way a nd disgorges a n 
enormous steel s phe re, which hurtles down the s lope. 
Whe n it reaches the bottom of t he s lope, a second portal 

CHAPTER 2  J  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

briefly a ppears  and tele ports the sphere back to the top 
of the s lope to begin  the process again. 

Initiative. The trap acts on initiative count 20 and ini 

tiative count 10. 

Initiative. The  tra p acts on initiative count 10 (but see

and other deadly effects . 

Active Element. AJthough the  trap is complex in na 
ture, it has a single active element. That's all  it needs . 

Sphere of Crushing Doom (Initiative 10). T he  trap's 
active element is  a sphere of steel tha t almost fills 
the 10-foot width of the hallway a nd rolls to the 
bottom of the s lope on its  turn . Each creature in 
the sphere's path must ma ke a DC 20 Stren gth 
saving throw. On a  failed save, a creature takes 22 
(4dl0) bludgeoning damage a nd is  knocked prone. 
On a s uccessful save, a creature  ta kes half as much 
damage and isn't knocked prone . Objects that block 
the sphere, such as a conjured wa ll, take maximum 
damage from the  impact. 

Locked Doors (Initiative 20). The four doors  to this 
room s lam s hut and are locked in place by magic. 
This  effect activates only o nce, the firs t time the trap 
is  triggered. 

Poison Gas (Initiative 20). Poison gas floods the 
room. Each creature inside  mus t m ake a  DC 20 
Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) poison 
damage on a fai led save, or ha lf as much damage on 
a s uccessful  one. 

Tempest (Initiative 10). Air a nd gas boils  from  the 
trap. Roll a d6, a nd cons ult the following table.

the sphere  becomes. 

Speed Kills. After its  turn, the sphere gains speed, 

represented by its  da mage increasing by 11  (2d10). 
While its damage is  55 (lOdlO) or greater, it acts on 
initiative count 20 and 10. 

Countermeasures. The trap can be  neutralized either 
by s topping the sphere or  preventing it from teleporting. 

Stop the Sphere. Stopping the s phere is  the easiest 
way to disrupt the  trap. A wall of force can do so 
easily, as can a ny object placed  in its path that has 
e no ugh hit points to absorb damage from  the sphere 
without being destroyed. 

Disrupt the Portals. Either portal can  be neutra lized 
with three successful DC 20 Intelligence (A rcana) 
checks, but the  process of a na lyzing a portal to 
disrupt it takes  time. Faint runes in the ceiling a nd 
floor at both ends of the hallway are involved in  the 
functioning of the  portals. A creature  must firs t 
use an action to examine a set of r unes, the n use a 
s ubsequent action to attempt to va nda lize the  runes. 
Each successful check reduces the sphere's damage 
by 11  (2d10), as the disrupted sphere  loses s peed 
moving through the  failing portal. 

AJternatively, a set of runes can be  disabled with 
three s uccessful castings of dispel m agic (DC 19) 
targeting any of the  runes in the set. 

If the southern portal is  destroyed, the s phere 
s lams into the south wall  and comes to a  ha lt. It 
blocks  the door to the  tomb, but the characters 
can  escape. 

POISONE D  TEMPEST 
Complex trap (level 11- 16, deadly threat) 

This fiendis h trap was built to eliminate intruders  who 
infiltrate a yuan-ti temple. The  trap is a  room, 60 feet 
on a side, with 5 -foot-wide stone doors  in the  middle of 
each wall. In each corne r of the  room stands  a  10-foot 
tall  s ta tue of a g reat serpent, coiled and ready to strike. 
The eyes in each s tatue are rubies wor th 200 gp apiece. 
Trigger. This  trap activates when a  ruby is pried  from 

one of the statues. Each s tatue's mouth s lides open, re 
vealing a  1-foot-wide pipe that runs  down its throat. 

CHAPTER 2  1 DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

Hallucinatory gas scrambles the m ind and senses. 
All  Intelligence and Wisdom checks made in the 
room have disadvantage until  the Tempest element 
activates agai n. 

Explosive gas fil ls  t he area . If anyone hold s an open 
flame,  it causes a n explos ion. All  creat ures in  the 
area must make a  DC 20 Dexte rity saving throw, 
taking 22  (4d10)  fire damage o n a failed  save, or 
half as much damage o n a successful one. The 
flame is then extinguished . 

Weakening gas fills  t he  room. All  Strength and  Dex 
terity checks made in  the room  have di sadvantage 
until the Tempest element act ivates again. 

Buffeting winds force each creature in the room to 
succeed on a  DC  20 Strength savin g throw or be 
knocked  pron e. 
Smoke fills  the room. Visibility is  reduced to 1 foot 
until the next time the Tempest element activates . 

Poison floods  the room, forcing creatures to make 
saving throws as for the Po ison Gas element.

Increased Potency. T he damage from  the Pois on Gas 
ele ment increases by 11 (2d10) each  round afte r it 
activates , to a  maximum of 55 (10d10). 

Countermeasures. There are a few ways that the  trap 

can be overcome. 

Open the Doors. Opening the doors  is the quickest 

way to circ umve nt the trap, but they a re wa rded with 
magic. To open the  doors , a character mus t firs t 
succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to 
find the locking m echa nism. A s uccessful DC 20 In 
telligence (Arcana) check is  then r equired  to disable 
the sphere of force that surrounds the lock (disp el 
magic is  ineffective against it). Success on a DC 20 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools  picks the  lock. 
Finally, a s uccessful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check is needed to push  the door open. Each check 
requires an action. 

Disable the Statues. A statue can be disabled by 
blocking the flow of gas from its mouth. Heavily 
damaging a statue is a  bad idea, for doing so leaves 
the gas vents open. Reducing a statue to 0  hit points 
(AC 17; 20 hp; resistance to fire,  piercing, and 
s lashing damage; immune  to poison and psychic 
damage) o r making a successfu l DC 20 Strength 
c heck to break it cracks the statue and increases the 
Poison Gas damage by  5 (ldlO). A successful DC 20 
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or a successful 
DC 15 Strength check made to block up the s tatue 
with a cloak or simi lar object, decreases the poison 
damage by 5 (ldlO). Once  a  character succeeds on 
t he check, someone must remain next to the statue 
to keep it blocked up. When a ll  four statues are 
blocked in this manner, the trap deactivates. 

DESIGNING  COMPLEX TRAPS 

Creating a complex trap takes more work than building 
a simple one, but with some practice, you can learn the 
process and make it move quickly. 

Familiarize yourself with the advice on designing a 
simple trap before proceeding with the guidelines on 
complex traps. 

PURPOSE 
Complex traps are typically designed to protect an area 
by killing or disabling intruders. It is worth your time to 
consider who made the trap, the t rap's purpose, and its 
desired result. Does the trap protect a  treasure? Does it 
target only certain  kinds of intruders? 

LEVEL AND  LETHALITY 
Complex traps use the same  level designations and 
lethality descriptors that simple traps do. Refer to that 
section for a discussion of how level and lethality help 
de termine saving throw a nd check DCs, attack bonuses, 
and other numerical elements of a  complex trap. 

MAP 
A complex trap has multiple parts, typically relies on 
the characters' positions to resolve some of its effects, 
and can bring several effects to  bear in each rou nd. 
The traps are called complex for a reason! To begin the 
design process, consider drawing a map of the area to 
be affected by the t rap on graph paper, using a scale of 5 
feet per square. This level of detail a llows you to develop 
a clear idea of what the trap can do and h ow each of its 
parts interact. Your map is the starting point and context 
for the rest of the design process. 

Don't limit yourself to one room. Look at the passages 

and rooms around the area of the  trap and think about 
the role they can play. The trap might cause doors to 
lock and barriers to fall  into place  to prevent escape. 
It could cause darts to fire from the wa lls  in one area, 
forcing characters to enter rooms where other devices 
trigger a nd threaten them. 

Consider how terrain and furniture can add to the 

trap's danger. A chasm or a  pit might create a  buffer that 
allows a  trap to send bolts of magic at the characters, 
while making it difficult or even impossible for them to 
reach the runes they must deface to foil  that attack. 

Think of your map like a script. Where  do the charac 

ters want to go? What does the trap protect? How can 
the characters get there? What are their likely escape 
routes? Answering these questions tells you where the 
trap's various elements should be placed . 

ACTIVE ELEMENTS 
A complex trap's active elements work the same way as 
a simple trap's e ffects, except that a complex trap acti 
vates in every round. Otherwise, the guidelines for pick 
ing saving throw DCs, attack bonuses, and damage are 
the same. To make your trap logically consistent, make 
su re the elements you design can activate each round. 
For instance, ordinary crossbows r igged to fire at the 
characters would need a mechanfam for reloading them 
between attacks. 

In terms  of lethality, it's better to have multiple dan 
gerous effects in a  trap than a single deadly one. For 
example, the Path of Blades trap uses two dangerous 
elements and one moderate element. 

It's useful to c reate multiple active ele me nts, with each 

affecting a different area. It's a lso a good idea to use 
a variety of effects. Some parts of the trap might deal 
damage, and others might immobilize characters or 
isolate them from the rest of the party. A bashing lever 
might knock characters into an area engulfed  by jets of 
flame. Think about how the e lements can work together. 

CONSTANT ELEMENTS 
In addition to the active steps a complex trap takes, it 
s hould also present a  continual hazard. Often, the active 
and constant effects are the same thing. Imagine a hall 
way filled w ith whirling saw blades. On the  trap's turn, 
the blades attack anyone  in the hall. In addition, anyone 
who lingers in the hallway takes damage at the end of 
each of their turns, accounting for the constant threat 
that the blades pose. 

A constant e lement shou ld apply its effect to any 
creature  that ends its turn in  that element's area. If an 
active element presents a  threat when it isn't the trap's 
turn, define the threat it poses as a constant element. 
As a  rule of thumb, keep the saving throw DC or attack 
bonus the same as for the active element but reduce the 
damage by half. 

Avoid filling the entire encou nter area with constant 
elements. Part of the challenge of a  complex trap lies in 
figuring out which areas are safe. A moment's respite 
can help add an element of pacing to an encounter with 
a  complex trap and give the characters the feeling that 
they aren't in constant peril. For example, walls  that 
s lam together might need to reset between slams, mak 
ing them harmless when it isn't their turn to act. 

DYNAMIC  ELEMENTS 
Just as a  battle is  more interesting if the monsters 
change their tactics or unveil new abi lities in later 
rounds, so too are complex traps more fun if their na 
ture changes in some way. The whirling blades that 
protect a  treasure chest do more damage each round as 
they speed up. The poison gas in a room grows thicker 
as more of it floods the chamber, dealing greater dam 
age and affecting line of sight. The necrotic aura around 
an idol of Demogorgon produces random effects each

TRIGGERS 
The advice on triggers given for simple traps also ap 
plies to complex traps, with one exception. Complex 
traps have multiple triggers, or are designed such that 
avoiding a  trigger prevents intruders from  reaching the 
area the trap guards. Other complex traps use magical 
triggers that activate on specific cues, such as when a 
door opens or someone enters an area without wearing 
the correct badge, amulet, or robe. 

Look at your map and consider when you want the 

trap to spring into action. It's best to  have a complex trap 
trigger after the characters have committed to exploring 
a n area. A s imple  trap m ight activate when the charac 
ters open a door. A complex trap that triggers so early 
leaves the characters still outside the trapped room, in 
a  place where they could decide to close the door and 
move on. A simple trap aims to keep intruders out. A 
complex trap wants to lure  them in, so that when  it acti 
vates, the intruders must deal with  the trap before they 
can escape. 

The trigger for a complex trap should be as foolproof 
as you can make it. A complex trap represents a serious 
ex penditure of effort and magical power. No one builds 
such a trap and makes it easy to avoid. Wisdom (Per 
ception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks might 
be unable to spot a  trigger, especially a  magical one, but 
they can still give hints  about the trap before it triggers. 
Bloodstains, ashes, gouges in  the floor, and other clues 
of that sort can serve as evidence of the trap's presence. 

INITIATIVE 
A complex trap acts repeatedly, but unlike characters 
and monsters, traps don't roll for initiative. As mechan 
ical or magical devices, their active elements operate in 
a  periodic manner. When designing a complex trap, you 
need to decide when and how often its active elements 
produce their effects. 

In a  trap with multiple active elements that work in 
concert, those different elements would act on different 
initiative counts. For instance, on initiative count 20, 
blades sweep across a treasure vault, driving the charac 
ters  back into the hallway. On initiative count 10, magic 
darts fire from statues in  the hallway while a  portcullis 
falls to confine the characters. 

Initiative 10. If a  trap's active element takes time to 

build up its effects, then it acts on initiative count 10. 
This option is  good for a trap that functions a longside 
a llied monsters or other guard ians; the delay before it 
acts can give guards the chance to move o ut of its area 
or force characters into the area before the trap triggers. 
Initiative 20. If an element is designed to surprise 
intruders and hit them before they can react, then it acts 
on initiative count 20. This option is generally best for a 
complex trap. Think of it as the default. Such a trap acts 
quickly enough to take advantage of most characters, 
with nimble characters like rogues, rangers, and monks 
having the best chance to move out of the area before 
the element activates. 

Initiative 20 and 10. Some active elements are in 
credibly fast acti ng, laying waste to intruders in  a few 
moments unless countered. They act on initiative count 
20 and 10. 

time its active element is  triggered. As water floods a 
chamber, the characters must swim across areas they 
could walk through just a  round or two earl ier. 

Since a complex trap remains active over the course 

of several rounds, it might be possible to predict its 
future behavior by examining how it functions. This 
information can give its targets a  much better chance of 
thwarting it. To minimize this possibility, design your 
trap so that it presents multiple threats that can change 
each round. The changes can include how a  trap targets 
creatures (different attacks or saving throws), the dam 
age or effects it produces, the areas it covers, and so 
on. Some traps might have a  random effect each round, 
while others follow a carefully programmed sequence 
of attacks. 

Dynamic elements usually occur according to a sched 

ule. For a  room that floods, you can plan out how the 
rising water level affects the area each round. The water 
might be ankle deep at the end of the first round, knee 
deep the next, and so on. Not only does the water bring a 
risk of drowning, it also makes it harder to  move across 
the area. On the other hand, the rising water level might 
allow characters to swim to the upper reaches of the 
chamber that they couldn't get to from the floor. 

Dynamic e lements can a lso come into play in  reaction 
to the characters' actions. Disarming one element of the 
trap might m ake the others dead lier. Disabling a  rune 
that triggers a  fire-breathing statue might cause the 
statue to explode. 

CHAPTER 2  (  DUNGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

DEFEATING COMPLEX TRAPS 
A complex trap is  never d efeated with a  single check. In 
s tead, each successful c heck foils some part of it or de 
grades its  performance. Each element of the trap must 
be overcome individually to defeat the trap as a whole. 
As part of determining how your trap can be over 
come, look at your map and con sider where the c ha rac 
ters must be  located to attempt an action t hat can foil 
part of the trap. As a rule, the ch a racters  should n eed to 
be near or adjacent to an ele ment to have a  ch a nce o f af 
fecting it. An element can  be designed so that it protects 
itself.  A fighter might be able  to break a whirli ng blade, 
but movin g close enough to attack it requ ires giving  the 
blade a  chance to strike. 

What method s a re effective against your trap? Obvi 
o us candidates a re activities covered  by the same sorts 
of checks used to defeat s imple traps, but use your 
knowledge of the trap's design to identify other options. 
A va lve th at leaks poison gas into a  room ca n be stopped 
up. A statue that emits a  deadly aura ca n be pushed over 
and smashed. Attacks, spells , and special abili ties can 
all play a  role in undermining a trap. 

Leave room for improvisation by the characters. Don't 

create a  few predetermined solut ions and wa it for the 
players to figure out the  right a pproach. If you under 
sta nd the mechanism b ehind how a  trap works, that 
makes it much easier for you to  respond to t he players' 
ideas. If a  ch aracter wants to try something you haven 't 
a llowed for,  pick an ability, assess the c ha nce of s uc 
cess, a nd ask for a  roll. 

Shutting down on e part of a  complex trap us ually 
requires mu ltiple successes. As a  default, it takes three 
successful checks or actions to disable a n element. The 
first successful check might reduce the element's saving 
throw DC or attack bonus. The second successful c heck 
might halve the ele ment's damage, a nd the fina l suc 
cessful check shuts  it down. 

For elements that don't attack , a llow each s uccessful 

c heck to reduce that element's effectiveness by one 
third. A lock's DC is decreased, or a gate opens wide 
enoug h to a llow a  Small ch a racter to squeeze through 
it. A mechanism pumping poison gas into  the room be 
comes defective, caus ing the gas's damage to increase 
more s lowly or not at all. 

It takes time to disable  a  complex trap. Three c harac 
ters can't make checks  in  rapid s uccession to disarm a 
complex trap in a  matte r of seconds. Each wou ld get in 

C OMP LEX  TRAPS  A ND  L EGEN D A RY  M O NST ERS 
A complex trap is like a  legendary monster in  some ways. 
It  has several tricks  it  can use on its tu rn, and it remains 
a threat throughout the round, not just on its turn . The 
trap's active elements are li ke  a legendary creature's nor 
mal  actions, and its constant e lements are equivalent to 
legendary actions-except t hey are tied to specific areas in 
the trapped room. 

Although a legendary creature can move, improvise 
actions, and so forth, a trap is set to  a specific script-an 
aspect that has the potential to make a complex trap stale 
and predictable. That's where dynamic elements come in. 
They keep the players on their toes and  make deali ng with 
a complex  trap fee l like a chal lenging,  evolving situation. 

a nother ch aracter's way and disrupt the effort. Once a 
character s ucceeds on a check, a nother character can't 
attempt the same c heck against the same trap element 
until th e end of the successful character's next tu rn. 

Not all of the characters' options  need to be focused 
on s topping a  trap from operating. T hink of what charac 
ters can do to mitigate or avoid a  trap's effects. Making 
the trap vulnerable to this sort of effort is a  way to e n 
gage characters  who might be ill-suited to confro nt the 
tra p directly. A successful Intelligence (Religion) check 
might provide insight into  t he imagery displayed by a 
tra p in a temple  or s h rine, giving other cha racters a  clue 
a bout how and where to direct their effor ts. A character 
could stand in front of a dart trap wh ile  holding a s hield 
that the darts can target harmlessly, while other cha rac 
ters trigger that element as they work to disable it. 

DOWNTIME REVISITED 
It's possible  for the c ha racters to start a campaign at 1st 
level, dive into an epic story, a nd  reach 10th level and 
beyond in a short amou nt of game time. Although that 
pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer 
a  ca mpa ign story with pauses built into it-times when 
adventurers a re  not going on adventures. T he downtime 
rules given in  this section can be used as alternatives to 
the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon 
Master's Guide, or you can use the material here to in 
spire  the creation o f your own o ptions. 

By e ngaging  the characters in downtime activities that 

take weeks o r even months to complete, you can give 
your campaign a  lo nger time line- one in w hich events 
in  the world play out over years. Wa rs  begin and end, ty 
rants com e and go, and royal lines rise and fall  over the 
course of the story that you and t he characters  tell. 

Downtime rules also provide ways  for characte rs  to 
spend-or be relieved of- the monetary treasure they 
amass on their adventures. 

The system presented he re consists of two elements. 

First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it de 
tails  a  number of downtime activities that characters 
can unde rta ke. 

RIVALS 

Rivals are NPCs who o ppose the c haracter s and make 
their presence felt whenever the characters  are engag 
ing in dow ntime. A rival might be a villain you have 
featured in past adventures or plan to  use in the future. 
Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at 
odds with' the characters, whether because they have 
opposing goals  or they simply dislike one another. The 
c ultist of Orcus whose plans the cha racters have foiled, 
the a mbitious  merchant prince who wants to rule the 
city with an iron  fist, and the nosy high p riest of Helm 
who is convin ced the c ha racters are up to no good are 
all examples  of rivals. 

A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the char 

acters engage in downtime only between adventures, 
their rivals rarely rest, cont inui ng  to spin plots and work 
against the c haracters even when the characters are off 
doing som ething else. 

CHAPTER 2  I DUNGEON  .MAST.ER'S TOOLS 

CREATING A  RIVAL 
Io essence, a  rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You 
can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to 
build a  new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your 
current cast of supporting characters  and embellish that 
NPC as described below. 

It's poss ible  for the characters to  have two or three r i 
vals at a  time, each with a separate agenda. At least one 
should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or 
good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or politi 
cal, rather than manifesting as direct attacks. 

T he best rivals have a connection with their adver 
saries on a  personal level. F ind li nks in the characters' 
backstories or the events of rece nt adventures that 
explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trou 
ble to put the characters in is trouble they created for 
themselves.

Wizard who blames the characters for some recent 
troubles

Childhood rival or member of a rival clan 
Scorned sibling or parent

Would-be tyrant who brooks no opposition 
Exiled  noble looking for revenge 
Corrupt official worried that recent misdeeds will 
be revealed 

To add the r ight amount of detail to a  riva l you want to 
create, give some thought to what that NPC is trying to 
accomplish and what resources and  methods the riva l 
can bring to bear against the characters. 

Goals. An effective r ival has a  clear reason for inter 
fering with the characters' lives. Think about what the 
rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the 
way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Idea lly, a 
rival's goal directly involves the characters or something 
they care about. 

CHAPTER  2  DUNGEON  ~IASTER"S TOOLS 

Assets. Think about the resources the r ival can mar 

sha l.  Does the character have eno ug h money to  pay 
bribes  or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does 
the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other 
groups? Make a  list of the rival's assets, and consider 
how they can be used. 

Plan s . The foundation of a  rival's presence in the 

campaign is the actions  t he  rival takes or the events that 
occur as a  resu lt of that character's goals. Each tjme you 
resolve one or more workweeks of downtime , pick one 
of the ways a  rival's plans  might be advanced and intro 
duce it into play. 

Think about how a  riva l might operate in o rde r to 
bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or 
four kinds of actions the rival  might undertake. Some 
of these might be  versions of the downtime activities 
described late r in  this section, but these are more often 
efforts that are specific to t he  rival. 

A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an as 
sassination attempt, that you play out during a session. 
Or it might be a  background activity that you describe 
as a ltering the ca mpaign in some way. For example, a 
r ival  who wants to increase the  prestige of the temple 
of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and 
gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly 
involved, the event becomes the talk of the town. 
Some elements of a rival's plans might involve 

even ts in the  world that aren't under t he rival's control. 
W hether s uch a n event can be easily anticipated or not, 
the rival 's plans might include cont ingencies  for taking 
advantage of such happenings. 

EXAMPLE  RIVAL:  MARINA RODEMUS 
The Rodemus clan was a small  but powerful family of 
traders in the city,  but years ago, they pulled up s takes 
and left town overnight. Marina Rodemus, the youngest 
child, has now returned to restore her family's prestige. 
In  truth , the family fled  because its members became 
afflicted by lycanthropy. They joined a clan ofwererats 
and delved into smuggling in a djstant city, out of fear 
t hat their secret would be impossible  to keep in  their 
former home. After fighting her way to the top ranks of 
the wererat clans, Marina-along with a s mall army of 
followers- has  returned to claim her place among the 
el ite of her home city. She vows that if she doesn't suc 
ceed, she'll leave the  city in ruins. 

Goals. Marina wants to become the most respected, 
most important merchant in town-someone to whom 
even the prince must yield. 

Assets. Marina has  a small fortune in gold;  her abili 
ties as a wererat, alchem ist, and necromancer; a  group 
of wererats dedicated to her; and a shleld g uardian that 
protects her. 

Plan s . Marina works to discredit and ruin other mer 
chants. Her wererats spy on her opponents and s neak 
into warehouses, unleashing hordes of rats to spoil 
goods. Marina even victimizes a few of her own ware 
houses to avoid suspicion. 

If Marina's plans fail, she has a  terrible alternative. 
Her knowledge of alchemy has enabled her to c reate a 
plague that she will un leash on the city through her rats. 
If she can't rul e, then no one will.

Rats become a  noticeable problem in  the streets,

Folk demand that action be taken. 
Caravan raids by goblinoids become more com

contributes generously to the effort. 
Warehouses are overrun with rats, ruining thou 
sands of gold pieces worth of goods. Marina 
blames the city for a lax effort in  pest control. 
If the characters interfere, Marina sends her as-
sassins against them. 
A sudden storm creates minor flooding, washing 
dozens of dead,  bloated, diseased  rats from the 
sewers. Terror over the plague rips through town. 
Marina fans the flames of panic, spreading  ru 
mors that the characters or other  riva ls in  town 
are responsible for the disease. 

EXAMPLE RIVAL:  HIGH PRIEST CHELDAR 
The temple of Pholtus, god of the s un, seeks to bring 
as many folk as possible under its sway. Though it has 
been in town for only two years, the temple is a lready a n 
influe ntia l force because of the determ ination and the 
brilliant oration of Cheldar, its high priest. 

Goals. Chelda r wants to ma ke the te mple of Pholtus 

the most popular rel ig ion in town by bringing about 
peace a nd security for a ll.  He believes keeping adventur 
e rs in c heck or driving the m out of town is  an important 
step in that plan. 

Assets. The charismatic high priest has his oratory 
skill, divine spellcasting ability, and a  few hundred com 
mon folk recently converted to the temple's cause. 

Plans. Cheldar is stern but fundamenta lly a good per 

son. He tries to win s upport by providing charity, pro 
moting peace, and working to enforce law and order. He 
is skeptical of the characters, however, convinced that 
they are troublemakers who will unde rmine  the  peace. 
He wants only officials of the town or the temple to be 
involved in  handling a ny crises that arise. He strongly 
believes in his goa ls, yet he might still be made into a n 
a lly by good-hearted characters.

Cheldar, along with a small group of followers, 
appears in  a tavern frequented by  adventurers 
and seeks converts. A few  NPC adventurers join 
his cause. 
In  a  public address  in  the town square, Cheldar 
rails against the forces of chaos, laying blame 
for recent troubles on adventurers who are med

The characters find that all  adventurers in  town 
receive an  icy  reception at best. 
Cheldar demands that the city levy enormous 
taxes on adventurers, claiming that they must 
pay their fair share to keep the city safe. 

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 

Downtime activit ies are tasks that usually take a work 
week (5 days) or longer to perform. T hese tasks can  in 
clude buying or c reating magic items, pulli ng off crimes, 
and working at a job. A cha racter selects a  downtime 
activity from a mong t hose available and pays the cost 
of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then fol 
low the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing  the 
player of the  results a nd any complications that ensue. 
Consider handling downtime away from the game 
table. For example, you could have the players  pick their 
downtime activities at the end of a  session, and then 
communicate about them by email or text, until you next 
see them in person. 

RESOLVING ACTIVITIES 
The description of each activity tells you how to resolve 
it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to 
note the character's relevant abi li ty modifie rs. Follow 
the steps in the activity, and determine the results. 

Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) 

to complete. Some activities requi re days, weeks (7 
days), or months (30 days). A cha racter must spend at 
leas t 8  hours of each day engaged in  the downtime activ 
ity for that d ay to count towa rd  the activity's completion. 
The days of a n activity don't need to be consecutive; 
you can spread them over a longer period of time than is 
required for the activity. But that period of time should 
be no more than twice as long as the required time; 
otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see 
below) and possibly double the activity's costs to repre 
sent the inefficiency of the character's p rogress. 

COMPLICATIONS 
The description of each activity includes a  discussion 
of complications you can throw at the characters. The 
conseque nces of a  complication might spawn entire 
adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give  the 
characte r s  headaches or advantages in any number of 
o ther ways. 

C H APTER  2  I  DUNGEON  MAST.ER'S TOOLS 

Each of these sections  has a  table t hat offers possible 
complications. You can roll to determine a complication 
random ly,  pick one from the table, or devise one of your 
own, and then share it w ith  the player. 

EXAMPLE  DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES ----
The following activities are s uitable fo r any character 
who can afford to pursue  them. As OM, you have the 
fina l say on which activities are available  to the char 
acters. The activities you allow might depend on the 
nature of the area where the characters are located. For 
example, you might disallow the creation of magic items 
or decide that the cha racters are in a  town that is too 
isolated from major markets for them to  buy s uch items. 

BUYING A  MAGIC  ITEM 
Purchasing a  magic item requires time and money to 
seek out and contact people willing to sell  items. Even 
then, there is  no guarantee a seller will  have  the items a 
character desires. 

Resources. Finding magic items to  purchase requires 
at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses. 
Spending more time and money increases your chance 
of finding a  high-quality item. 

Resolution. A character seeking to buy a magic item 

makes a Cha risma (Persuasion) check to determine 
the quality of the seller found. The character gains a 
+l bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the 
first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1  bonus for 
every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a 
maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes 
a wealthy lifestyle, for a  buyer must impress potential 
business partners. 

As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the tota l of 

the check dictates wh ich table in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the 
market. Or you can roll  for items from any table associ 
ated with a  lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. 
As a further option to reflect the availability of items 
in you r campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low 
magic ca mpa igns  or a +10 bonus for h igh  magic cam 
paigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs 
in low magic campaigns. 

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign 

prices to the avai lable items, based on their rarity. 
Ha lve the price of a ny consumable  item, such as a po 
tion or a scroll, w hen using the table  to determine a n 
asking price. 

You have final say in deter mining w hich items are for 
sale and their final  price, no matter what the tables say. 

If the characters seek a specific magic item, first 
decide if it's an  item you want to allow in your game. If 
so, include the desired item among the items for sale 
on a  check total of 10 or higher if the item is common, 
15 or higher if it is  uncommon, 20 or higher if it is rare, 
25 or higher if it is very rare, and 30 or higher if it is 
legendary.

CAROUSING 
Carousing is a  default downtime activity for many cha r 
acters. Between adventu res, who doesn't want to relax 
w ith a  few drin ks and a g roup of friends at a tavern? 
Resources. Carousing covers a workweek of fine 
food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can at 
tempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class 
fo lk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 
10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. 

Carous ing with the upper class requires 250 gp for  the 
workweek a nd access to the local nobility. 

A ch aracter w ith the noble  background ca n m ingle 
w ith the  upper class, but other characters can do so only 
if you judge tha t the c ha racte r h as made s ufficient con 
tacts. Alternatively, a c haracter  might use a  disguise kit 
a nd the Deception s kill to pass as a noble vis iting from a 
distant city. 

Resolution. After a workweek of carousing, a charac 

te r sta nds  to ma ke contacts within  the selected social 
class. The character  makes a  Charis ma (Pers uasion) 
c heck us ing  the  Carousing table.

Character has made a hostile contact. 
Character has made no new contacts. 
Character has made an allied contact. 
Cha racter has made two all ied contacts. 
Character has made three allied contacts. 

Contacts are NPCs w ho  now share a  bond with the 
c harac ter. Each one either owes the ch aracte r a  favor 
or has some  reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact 
works against the c haracter, placing obstacles but s top 
ping s hort of com mitting a  crime or a viole nt act. Allied 
contacts a re  friends w ho w ill re nde r aid to t he c haracte r, 
b ut not a t the r is k of the ir lives. 

Lowe r-class contacts include criminals, la borers, 
mercenaries, t he  town guard , and a ny other folk who 
normally freque nt the cheapest taverns in town. 

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spell 
casters, town officials , and other folk who frequent well 
ke pt establishments. 

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal 
servants. Carousing with s uc h folk covers  for mal ban 
que ts, state dinne rs, and the like. 

Once a  contact has helped or hinde red a cha racter, 
the c ha racter  needs to carouse again to get back into the 
NPC's good graces. A contact provides h elp once, not 
help for life.  The contact remains  frie nd ly,  which can in 
fluence roleplaying and how t he characters interact w ith 
the m , but doesn't come w ith a guara ntee of help. 

You ca n assign specific NPCs as contacts. You  might 

decide that the  barkeep a t the Wretched Gorgon and 
a gu a rd s tationed at the western gate are the charac 
te r's a llied contacts. Assigning specific  NPCs gives the 
players concre te options. It brings  the ca mpaign to life 
a nd seeds  the area w it h N P Cs that the characters care 
a bout.  On the other ha nd, it can prove difficult to track 
and might re nde r a  contact useless if that character 
doesn't come into play. 

Alternatively, you can a llow the player to ma ke  an 
NPC into a contact on the spot, after carous ing. Whe n 
the cha racters are in t he a rea in which they caroused , 
a  player can expe nd an a llied contact and designate 
a n NPC they meet as a  contact, assuming  the NPC is 
of the  correct social class based on how the ch a racter 

CHAPTER 2  I  DUNGEON  Ml\STER'S TOOLS 

caroused. The  player should provide a  reasonable expla 
nation for this relationship and work it into the game. 
Using a  mix of the  two approaches is a good idea, 
since it gives you the added depth of s pecific contacts 
wh ile giving players  the freedom to ens ure  that the con 
tacts they accumu late are useful. 

The same process ca n apply to  hostile contacts. You 

can give the characters a specific NPC they s hould 
avoid, or you m ight introduce one at an inopportune or 
dramatic  moment. 

At a ny time, a  character can have a  maximum number 
of uns pecified allied contacts equal to  1 +the character 's 
Charis ma  modifie r (minimum of 1). Specific, na med 
contacts don't count toward this  limit- only ones t hat 
can be  used at any time  to declare an NPC as a contact. 
Complications. Characters who ca rouse ris k bar 
brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and 
building a  bad re putation around town. As a rule o f 
thumb, a cha racter has a  10 percent chance of triggering 
a  complication for each workweek of carousing.

CRAFTING AN ITEM 
A cha racter who has the time, the money, a nd the 
needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, 
cloth ing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear. 

Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appro 
priate tools  for the item to be crafted, a character needs 
raw mater ials wor th half of the item's selling cost. To 
determine how many workweeks it takes to create an 
item, divide  its gold piece cost by SO. A cha racter can 
complete  multiple items in a workweek if the items' com 
bined cost is SO gp or lower. Items that cost more than 
SO gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as 
long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location. 
Multiple characters ca n combine their e fforts. Divide 
t he  time  needed to create an item by the number of cha r 
acters working on it.  Use your judgment w hen determin 
ing how many characters ca n collaborate on an item . A 
particularly tiny item, like a  rin g,  might allow only one 
or two workers, w hereas a  large, complex item m ight 
a llow four or more wo rkers. 

A character needs to be  proficient with the tools 
needed to craft an  item a nd have access to the appro 
priate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to 
have the appropriate tool proficiency. You  need to make 
a ny judgment calls  regarding whether a character has 
the correct equipment. The following table provides 
some exa mples. 

Proficiency 

Herbalism kit 
Leatherworker's tools 
Sm ith 's tools 
Weaver's  tools 

Items 
Antitoxin, potion of healing 
Leather armor, boots 
Armor, weapons 
Cloaks, robes 

If all the above requirements are met, the result of th e 

process is an item of the desired sort. A character can 
sell a n item crafted in  this way at its listed  price. 

Crafting Magic Items. Creating a  magic item requi res 

more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a  long 
term process that involves one or more adventures to 
track down rare materials and the lore needed to cre 
ate the  item. 

Potions of healing and spell scr oJ/s a re exceptions  to 
the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing 
Potions of Healing" later in this section and the  "Scrib 
ing a Spell S croll" section, below. 

To start with, a c haracte r needs a  formu la  for a  magic 

item in order to create it. The formu la  is  like a  recipe. 
It lis ts  the materia ls  needed a nd steps required  to 
make the  item. 

An  item invariably requires an exotic  material to com 
plete it. This  materia l ca n ra nge  from the s kin of a yeti to 
a vial of wate r  taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental 
P la ne of Water. Finding that materia l should  take place 
as part of an adventure. 

The Magic Item Ingredients  tabl e suggests the c hal 
lenge rating of a creature that the cha racters need to 
face to acquire  the materials for an item. Note that fac 
ing a creature does not necessa rily mean that t he c har 
acters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the 
c reature  might gua rd a  location or a  resource t hat the 
cha racte rs  need access to.

If appropriate, pick a monster or a  locatio n that is a 
thematic fit  for the  item to be crafted. For example, cre 
ating mariner's armor  might require the essence of a 
water weird. Crafting a staff of charming  mig ht require 
the cooperation of a specific a rca naloth, who w ill  help 
only if the c haracters complete a  task for it.  Making a 
staff of power might hinge on acquiring a  piece of a n 
an cie nt stone that was once touched by the god of mag 
ic- a s tone  now gu arded  by a s uspicious androsphinx. 
l n addition to facing a specific creature, c reating a n 
item comes with a gold piece cost covering other mate 
rials, tools, a nd so on, based on the item's  rarity.  Those 
va lues, as well as the  time a  character needs to work in 
order to complete the  item, are s hown on the Magic Item 
Crafting Time a nd Cost table. H a lve the .listed price and

To complete a magic item, a ch aracter also needs 

wh atever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a 
nonmagical object, or proficie ncy in th e Arcana s kill. 

If all  the above requirements are met, the  result of the 

process is a  magic item  of the desired sort. 

Comp lications. Most of the complications involved in 
creating something, especially a magic item, a re linked 
to the difficulty in  finding rare ingredients or compo 
ne nts  needed to comple te  the work. The complications 
a cha rac te r mi ght face as byproducts o f the  creation 
process are most interesting when the cha racters are 
working on a  magic item: there's a  10 percent chance for 
every five  workweeks spent on crafting an item that a 
complication occurs. The Crafting Complications  table 
provides examples of what might happen.

PIT FIGHTING 
Pit fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonle 
thal forms of combat in an  organized setting with prede 
ter mined matches. If you want to introduce competi tive 
fighting in a battle-to-the-death situation, the standard 
combat ru les apply to that sort of activity. 

Resources. Engaging in this activity requires one 

workweek of effort from a character. 

Resolution. The character  must  make a series of 
checks, with a D C determined at random based on the 
quality of the opposition that the character runs i nto. 
A  big part of the challenge in pit fighting lies in the un 
known nature of a cha racter 's opponents. 

The character  makes three checks: Strength (Athlet 
ics),  Dexterity (Acrobatics), and a special Constitution 
check  that has a bonus equal to a rol l of the character's 
largest Hit Die (this roll doesn't spend that die). ff de 
sired , the character can  replace one of these skill check s 
w ith an attack roll using one o f the cha racter's weapons. 
The DC for each o f the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a

RELAXATION 
Som etimes the best thing to do between adventu res is 
relax. Whether  a cha racter wants a bard-earned vaca 
tion or needs to recover  from injuries, relaxation is t he 
ideal option for adventurer s who need a brea k. This op· 
tion is a lso idea l  for pl ayers who don't want to make use 
of the downtime system. 

Resources. Relaxation requires one week. A charac 
ter needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while 
relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity. 

Resolution. C ha racters who maintain at least a mod 
est l ifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While 
relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws 
to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In 
addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one 
effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, 
or ca n restore one ability score that has been reduced to 
less than its normal value. T his benefit ca nnot be used 
if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other 
magica l effect with a n ongoing duration. 

Complications. Relaxation rarely comes with com  
plicat ions. I f you want to make life complicated  for the 
characters, introduce an action or an event connected 
to a r ival. 

RELIGIOUS  SERVICE 
C haracters with a religious bent might want to spend 
downtime in ser vice to a temple, either by attending 
rites or by prosely tizing in the community. Someone 
w ho undertakes this activity has a chance of winning 
the favor of the temple's leaders. 

R esources. Performing religious service requires ac 
cess to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs 
and et ho~ align with the character's. If such a place is 
available, the activity takes one workweek of t ime but 
involves no gold piece expend iture. 

R esolution. At t he end of t he required time, the char 
acter chooses to make either  an Intelligence (Religion) 
check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of 
the check determines the benefits of service, as shown 
on the Religious Service table. 

workweek spent in religious service brings a  10 percent 
chance of a complication, examples of which are on the 
Religious Service Complicatio ns  table.

RESEARCH 
Forewarned is  forearmed. The research downtime ac 
tivity a llows a cha racter to de lve into lo re concerning a 
monster, a  location, a  magic item, or some other partic 
ular topic. 

Resources. Typically, a character needs access to a 
library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such 
access is available, conducting research requires one 
workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materia ls, 
bribes, gifts, and other ex penses. 

Resolution. The character decla res the foc us of the 
research-a specific person, place, or thing. After one 
workweek, the cha racter makes a n Intell igence check 
with a +1 bonus per 100 gp s pent beyond the initial 
100 gp, to a  maximum of +6. In addition, a character 
who has access to a  particula rly well-stocked  library 
or knowledgeable sages gains adva ntage on this check.

SCRIBING A  SPELL SCROLL 
With time and patience, a  spellcaster can transfer a 
spell  to a  scroll, creatin g a spell scroll. 

Resources. Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of 
time and money related to the level of the spell  the char 
acter wants to scribe, as shown in  the Spell Scroll Costs 
table. In addition, the character must have  proficiency 
in  the Arcana skill  and must provide any materia l com 
ponents required fo r the casti ng of the spell. Moreover, 
the c haracter must have t he spell  prepared, or it  must be 
among the character's known spells, in  order to scribe a 
scroll of that spell. 

If the scribed spell is a can trip,  the version on the 

scroll  works as if the caster  were 1st level.

SELLING  A  MAGIC  ITEM 
Selling a magic  item is by no  means an easy task.  Con 
artists and thieves are a lways looking out for an easy 
score, and there's no guarantee that a  character w ill  re 
ceive a good offer even if a  legitimate buyer is found. 
R esources. A c haracter can find a  buyer for one 

magic ite m  by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which 
is  used to spread word of the desired sale. A c haracter 
mus t pick one item at a  time to sell. 

Resolution. A character w ho  wants to sell  an item 
must make a  Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine 
what kind of offer comes in. The character can always 
opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effor t 
and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices 
and Magic Item Offer tables to determi ne  the sale  price.

CHAPTER 2  I DUNGEON  MASTER·s TOOLS 

AWARDING MAGIC  ITEMS 
Magic items a re  prized by D&D adventurers of a ll sorts 
a nd are ofte n the  main reward in an adventure. The 
ru les for  magic items are presented, along w ith the 
Treasure Hoard tables, in chapter 7 of the Dungeon 
Master's Guide. This section expands on those rules by 
offering you an a lte rnative way of determ ini ng which 
magic ite ms e nd up in t he c ha racters' possession and by 
add ing a  collection of common  magic items to the game. 
T he  section e nds  with tables that group magic items ac 
cordin g to ra rity. 

The system  in the Dungeon Master's Guide is  de 
s igned so that you ca n generate a ll  treasure  random ly, 
and th e tables also govern the number of magic  items 
the c ha racters  receive. In s hort, t he  ta bles d o the work. 
But a  DM  w ho's d esigning or modifying a n adventure 
might prefer to choose the magic items that come into 
play. If you're in that s ituation, you can use the rules in 
this section to pe rsonalize your treasure h oa rds  whil e 
staying within the gam e's limits  for how many items the 
ch aracters s hould u ltimately accumulate. 

DISTRIBUTION BY  RARITY 
This a lternative me thod of treasure determ ination fo 
cuses on c hoosing  magic  items  based on thei r ra rity, 
rather than by rolling on the  tables in the Dungeon Mas 
ter's  Guide. This method uses two tables: Magic  Items 
Awarded by Tier a nd  Magic Ite ms  Awarded  by Rarity. 
By Tier. The Magic Ite ms  Awarded by Tie r  table 

s hows the  numbe r of magic items a D&D party typically 
ga ins  du ri ng a  campaig n, culminating in the group's 
having accumulated one hundred magic items by 20th 
level.  T he  table  s hows how many of those items are 
meant to  be handed out during each  of the  four tiers of 
play. The emphasis on characters receiving more items 
during the second tier (levels  5- 10) than in ot her tiers 
is by design. The second tie r is where much of the play 
occurs  in a  typical D&D campaign, a nd the items gained 
in  that tier prepare the characters for higher-level 
adven tures. 

By Rarity. The Magic Items Awarded  by Rarity table 

ta kes the numbers from  the Magic Items Awa rded by 
Tier table a nd  breaks them down to show the number of 
ite m s o f each rarity the ch aracters are expected  to h ave 
w he n  they reach the e nd of a  t ie r. 

Minor and Major Items. Both tables in this sectio n 
make a distinction between minor  magic items and ma 
jor magic items. This distinction exists  in  the Dungeon 
Master's Guide, yet those terms aren't used th ere. In 
that book, the mino r items are those listed on Magic 
Item Tables A through E, and the major items a re  on 

MAGIC  ITEMS  AWARDED  BY  RARITY 

BEHIND THE  DESIGN :  MAGIC  ITEM  DISTRIBUT I ON 
The Dungeon  Master's Guide assumes a certain amount of 
treasure will  be found over the course of a campaign. Over 
twenty levels of typical  play,  the game expects forty-five 
rolls on the Treasure Hoard tables , distributed as follows: 

•  Seven rolls on the Challenge 0-4 table 
•  Eighteen rolls on the Challenge 5-10 table 
•  Twelve  rolls on the Challenge 11-16 table 
•  Eight roll s on the Challenge 17+ table 

Because many of the table results call  for more than one 
magic item, those forty-five  rolls will  result in  the charac 
ters obtaining rough ly one hundred items. The optional 
system described here yields the same number of items, 
distributed properly throughout the spectrum of rarity, 
while enabling you to control exactly which items the char 
acters have a chance of acquiring. 

Magic Item Tables F  t hrough I. As you can see from the 
Treasure Hoard tables in that book, major magic items 
are meant to be handed out much less frequently than 
m inor items, even at higher levels of play.

CHOOSING ITEMS  LEVEL BY LEVEL 
You decide when to place an ite m  in an adventure that 
you're creating or modifyi ng , usually because you think 
the story calls  for a  magic item, the characters need one, 
or the players would be especially p leased to get one. 

When you want to select an item as treasure for an en 
counter, the Magic Items Awarded by Rar ity table serves 
as your item budget. Here's  how to use it: 

1. jot down a copy of the table  in your notes, so that you 
ca n make adjustments to the numbers as you select 
items to be placed in an advent ure. 

2. Refer to th e line in  the Level/CR column that corre 
sponds to one of the following va lues (your choice): 
the level of the player characters, the challenge rating 
of the magic  item's owner, or the challenge rating of 
the group of c reatures guard ing  the item. The entries 
in  that row of the table indicate the total number of 
items that would be appropriate for the characters to 
receive by the end of the tier represented by that row.

3. Choose a magic item of any rarity for which the entry 

in this row is not 0. 

4. When  the characters obtain an  item , modify your 

notes to indicate which part of your budget this expen 
diture came fro m  by subtracting 1 from the appropri 
ate entry on the table. 

In the  future, if you choose an item of a rarity that's 
not available in the current tier but is sti ll available in 
a lower  tier, deduct the item from the lower  tier. If a ll 
lower  tiers also have no items available o f a given rarity, 
deduct the item from a higher tier. 

CHOOSING ITEMS  PIECEMEA L 
If you prefer  a more free-form m ethod of choosing magic 
items, simply select each magic item you wan t to give 
out; then, when the characters acquire one, deduct it 
from the M agic Item s Awarded by R arity table in your 
notes. Whenever you do so, start with the lowest tier, 
and deduct the item from the first  number you com e 
across in the appropriate rarity column for the item , 
whether  its minor or major. If that tier doesn't have a 
number  greater t han  0  for that ra rity, go up a tier  until 
you find one that does, and deduct the magic item from 
that number. Following this process, you will zero out 
each row of the table in order, going from the lowest lev 
els to the highest. 

O VE RSTOCKING AN ADVENTURE 
The magic item tables in this section are based on the 
number of items the characters are expected to r eceive, 
not the number of items that are available in an adven 
ture. When  creating or  m odifyi ng a n adventure, assume 
that the characters won't find all the item s you place in 
it, unl ess most of the loot is in easy-to-find locations. 
H ere's a good ru le of thumb: an adventure can include a 
number  of items that's 25 percent higher  than the num 
ber s in the tables (round up). For example, an adventure 
d esigned to tak e characters from 1st to 4th level might 
include fourteen item s rather than eleven, in the expec 
tation that three of those items won't be found. 

ARE  M ACIC  ITE MS  NECESSARY  I N  A  CAMPAIG N ? 
The D&D  game is  built on the assumption that magic 
items appear sporadically and that they are always a  boon , 
unless an item bears  a curse. Characters and monsters are 
built to face each other without the help of magic items, 
which  means that having a  magic item always  makes a 
character more powerful  or versatile than a  generic char 
acter of the same level. As  DM, you  never have to worry 
about awarding magic items just so the characters can 
keep  up with the campaign's threats. Magic items are truly 
prizes. Are they useful? Absolutely. Are they necessary? No. 
Magic items can go from  nice to necessary in  the rare 
group that has no spellcasters, no monk, and  no N PCs 
capable of casting magic weapon.  Having no magic ma kes 
it  extremely difficult for a party to overcome mons ters that 
have resistances or immunity to nonmagica l damage. In 
such a game, you'll want to be generous with magic weap 
ons or else avoid usi ng such monsters. 

CHAPTER  2  I DUKGEON  MASTER'S TOOLS 

COMMON  MAGIC  ITEMS 
The Dungeon Master's Guide includes many magic 
item s of every rarity. The one exception are common 
item s; that book includes few o f them. This section intro 
duces more of them  to the game. These items seldom in 
crease a character's power, but they are likely to amuse 
players and provide fun roleplaying opportunities. 

The magic items are presented in alphabetical order. 

ARMOR OF  GLEAMING 
Armor (any m edium or heavy),  common 
This armor never  gets dirty. 

BEAD  OF NOURISHMENT

CLOAK OF MANY FASHIONS 
Wondrous  item , common 
While w earing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to 
cha nge the style, color, and appar ent quality o f the gar 
m ent. The cloak's weight doesn't  change. Regardless of 
its appearance, the cloak can't be a nyt hing but a cloak. 
Alt hough it can duplicate the appearance of other magic 
cloaks, it doesn't gain t heir m agical proper ties. 

CLOCKWORK AMULET 
Wondrous item, common 
This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears 
and is powered  by magic from Mechanus, a  plane of 
clockwork predictabili ty. A c reature  that puts an ear to 
the a mulet can hear faint ticking and  whirring noises 
coming from within.

Once used, this property can't be used aga in until the 
next dawn. 

CLOTHES OF MENDING 
Wondrous item, common

following benefits: 

•  You  can  use the amulet as a spellcasting focus for 

your warlock spells. 

•  You  can  try to cast a  ca ntrip that you  don't know. The 
cantrip must be on the warlock spell list, and you 
must make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the 
check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the c heck fails, 
so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell 
is  wasted. In either case, you can't use this property 
again until you finish a  long rest. 

DREAD HELM 
Wondrous item, common 
This fearsome steel helm makes your eyes glow red 
while you wear it. 

EAR HORN OF HEARING

pages, can't be damaged by fire or immers ion in water. 
In add ition, the spellbook doesn't deteriorate with age. 

ERSATZ EYE 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) 
This artificial eye replaces a real one that was lost or

socket, it can't be removed by anyone other than you, 
a nd you can see through the tiny orb as though it were a 
normal eye. 

HAT OF VERMIN 
Wondrous item, common 
This hat has 3 charges. While holding the  hat, you can 
use an action to expend 1 of its charges and speak a 
command word that s ummons you r choice of a  bat, a 
frog, or a  rat (see the Player's Handbook or the Monster 
Manual for statistics). The summoned creature magi 
cally appea rs in the hat and tries to get away from you 
as quickly as possible. The creature is neither friendly 
nor  hostile, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as 
an ordinary creature  of its kind and disappears after 1 
hour o r when it drops to 0  hit points. The hat regains a ll 
expended charges da ily at dawn. 

HAT OF WIZARDRY 
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a 
wizard) 
This antiquated, cone-shaped hat is adorned with gold 
crescent moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you 
gain the  following benefits: 

•  You can use the hat as a spellcasting focus for your 

wizard spells. 
You  can try to cast a cantrip t hat you don't know. The 
cantrip must be on the wizard spell list, and you must 
make a  DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the 
check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, 
so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell 
is wasted. In either case, you can't use this  property 
aga in until you finish a  long rest. 

REWARD'S HANDY SPICE POUCH 
Wondrous item, common 
This belt pouch appears empty and has 10 charges.

Master's Guide is useful if you want to design other com 
mon magic items. For example, the What Minor Property 
Does It Have? table might inspire you to create a magic 
item that allows a character to speak and understand the 
Goblin language (based on the table's  Language property), 
a magic item that glows in the presence of fiends  (based 
on the Sentinel property), or a magic item that projects 
its user's voice over a great distance  (based on the Wa r 
Leader property).

Some magic items can  be used a limited number of times 
but are recharged by the arrival of dawn. What if you're on 
a plane of existence that lacks  anything resembling dawn? 
The  DM should choose a time every 24 hours when such 
magic items recharge on that plane of existence. 

Even on a world that experiences dawn each day,  the DM 

is free to choose a different time-perhaps noon, sunset, 
or midnight- when certain magic items recharge.

CHAPTER 3 

SPELLS 

ANY OF THE C H ARACTER CLASSES  IN THE 
Player's Handbook harness  magic in the 
fo rm of spells. This chapter provides new 
spells for those classes, as well as for 
spellcasting monsters. The Dungeon Mas 
ter decides which of these spells are avail 
able in a ca mpaign and how they can be 
learned. For example, a  DM might decide 

that some of the spells are freely ava ilable, that others 
are unobtainable, and that a  handful can be found on ly 
after a specia l quest, pe rhaps discovered in  a long-lost 
tome of magic. Wizard spells, in particular, ca n be intro 
duced to a ca mpaign  in spell books found as treasu re. 

When a DM adds spells to a  campaign, clerics, druids, 

and paladins require special consideration. When char 
acters of those classes prepare their spells, they have ac 
cess to the entire spell list for thei r class. Given that fact, 
the DM should  be cautious about making all  of these 
ne w spells  available  to a  player who is overwhelmed 
when presented with many options. For such a player, 
consider adding only story-appropriate spells  to  the spell 
list of that player's character. 

SPELL LISTS 
The fo llowing spell lists show which spells can be cast 
by character s of each class. Aspell's school of magic is 
noted in parentheses. If a spell can be cast as a ritua l, 
the ritual tag also appea rs  in the parentheses.

pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage a nd is  restrained, 
pinched between the  pillar a nd the obstacle. The re 
stra ined creature can use an action to make a Strength 
or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) agai nst the

By gathering threads of s hadow mate rial from the Shad

CHAPTER  3  I SPELLS 

cupied space that you can see within range. The illusion 
lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if 
it were a creature. 

When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that 
can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or 
become frightened of it for  1 minute. If a frightened crea 
ture ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line 
of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, 
ending the effect on itself on a s uccess. 

As a  bonus action on your turn, you can move the  illu 
sion up to 60 feet. At any point during its  movement, you 
can cause it to ex hale a  blast of energy in a 60-foot cone

The illus ion is tangible  because of the shadow stuff 
used to create it,  but attacks miss it automatically,  it s uc 
ceeds on a ll  saving throws, and it is immune  to a ll  dam 
age and conditions. A creature that uses an action to 
examine  the dragon ca n determine that it is  an illusion 
by succeeding on an Intelligence (Jnvestigation) check 
against your spell save DC. If a creature disce rns the 
illusion for w hat it is, the creatu re ca n see through it and 
has advantage on saving throws against its  breath.

INFERNAL CALLING 
5th-level conjuration 

Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a ruby worth at least 999 gp) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 

Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil  from 
the Nine Hells. You  choose the devil's type, which must 
be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a  barbed 

devil or a  bearded devil. The devil  appears in an unoc 
cupied space that you can see within range. The devil 
disappears when it drops to 0  hit points or when the 
spell ends. 

The devil is unfriendly toward you and your com 
panions. Ro ll  initiative for the devi l, which has  its own 
tu rns. It is  under the Dungeon Master's control and acts 
according to its nature on each of its turns, which might 
resu lt in its attacki ng you if it thinks it can prevail, or 
trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange 
for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics. 
On each of your turns, you can try to iss ue a  verbal 

command to t he devil (no action  required by you). It 
obeys the command if the likely outcome is in  accor 
dance with its desires, especially if the resu lt would 
draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Cha 
risma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check 
contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the 
check with advantage if you say the devil 's true name. 
If your check fails, the d evil  becomes immune to your 
verbal comma nds  for the duration of the spell , t hough it 
ca n still  carry o ut your commands if it chooses. If your 
check succeeds, t he d evil carries out your command 
such as "attack my e nemies,"  "explore the room ahead," 
or "bear this message to the queen"- until it completes 
the activity, at which point it returns to you to report hav 
ing done so. 

If your concentration ends before the spell  reaches its 
full  duration, the devil  doesn't disappear if it has become 
immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in 
whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it 
disappears. 

If you possess an individual devil 's talisman, you can 

summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge 
rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no 
Charisma checks required. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell  slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating in 
creases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

least 5  feet. Roll  a d4 for the direction:  1, north; 2, south;

portunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is  blocked, 
the target doesn't move. 

The spell's damage increases by  ld6 when you reach 

5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

stone has AC  15 a nd 30 hit points per inch of thickness. 
It is immune to poison a nd psychic damage. Reducing 
a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might 
cause connected sections  to buckle and collapse at the 
DM's discretion .

else, the fortress ha rm lessly crumbles a nd s inks back

ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it 
reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't 
disappear for ld6 rounds if it still has hit points.

Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a  holy symbol worth at least 5 gp) 
Duration: 24 hours 

You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground 
you can see within range. The temple must fit within an 
unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. 
The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated 
to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented 
by the holy symbol used in the casting. 

You make all decisions about the temple's appear 
ance. The interior is enclosed by a floor,  walls, and a 
roof, with one door granting access to  the interior and 
as many windows as you wish. Only you a nd any crea 
tures you designate when you cast the spell can open or 
close the door. 

The temple's interior is  an open space with a n idol 
or a lta r at one end. You decide whether the temple is 
illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light 
or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air 
within, and the temperature is mild. 

The temple opposes types of creatures you choose 
when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the fol 
lowing: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a 
creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, 
that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On 
a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even 
if the creature can enter the temple, the m agic there 
hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability 
check, or a saving throw inside ilie temple, it must roll a 
d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll. 

CHAPTER 3  I SPELLS 

In addition, the sensor s created by divination spells 

can't appear ins ide  the temple, and creatures within 
can't be targeted by divination spells. 

Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains 
hit points  from  a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature 
regains add itional hit points equal to your Wisdom mod 
ifier (minimum 1 hit point). 

The temple is made from opaque magical force that 
extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal 
travel in to the temple's interior. Nothing can physically 
pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled 
by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A 
disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly. 

Casting this spell  on the same spot every day for a 

year makes this effect permanent. 

TENSER' S  TRANSFORMATION

the Attack action on your turn. You  ignore this benefit 
if you already have a  feature, like Extra Attack, that 
gives you extra attacks.

a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of 
exha ustion.

and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of 
your destination space for the creature  to appear in; oth 
erwise, the creature is left behind. 

At Higher Levels- When you cast this spell  using a

ldlO fo r each s lot level above 3rd. 

1)DAL WAVE 
3rd-level conjuration 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water) 
Duration: Instantaneous 

You  conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an

up to 10 feet wide, and up to  10 feet tall. Each creature 
in that area must make a  Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage 
and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature

choose one of the fo llowing effects. 

Transm ute Rock to Mud. Nonmagical roc k of any 
sort in the a rea becomes a n equal volume of thic k, flow 
ing mud that remains for the s p ell's duration. 

The ground in the spell's a rea becomes muddy e nough 

that creatures can s ink into  it. Each foot that a c reature 
moves through the mud costs 4  feet of movement, and 
any c reature on  the ground w he n you cast the spell  must 
m ake a Strength sav ing  throw. A creature mus t a lso 
m ake the saving throw when it moves into the area for 
the first time on a  turn or e nds  its  turn there. On a fa iled 
save, a creature s inks  into the mud and  is  restrained, 
though it can  use a n action to e nd the restra ined condi 
tion on itself by pu lling itself free of the mud. 

If you cast the s pe ll  on a ceiling, the  mud fa lls. Any 
creature  under the  mud whe n it fa lls  must m a ke  a Dex 
terity savi ng  throw. A c reature takes 4d8 bludgeoning 
damage on a  fail ed save, or ha lf as much damage o n a

VITRIOLIC  SPHERE 
4th-level evocation 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 150 feet 
Components: V, S , M (a drop of giant s lug bile) 
Duration: Ins tantaneous 

You  point at a location within range, and a glowing, 
1-foot-cliameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and 
explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in 
that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an 
other 5d4 acid damage at the end of its  next turn. On a 
s uccessful save, a c reature takes half the initial damage 
and no damage at the end of its  next turn. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell  using a 
spell s lot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage in 
creases by 2d4 for each s lot level above 4th. 

WALL OF LIGHT 
5th-level evocation 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a  hand mirror) 
Duration: Concentration, up to  10 minutes 

A s himmering wall of bright Light appears at a point you 
choose within range. The wall appears in any orienta 
tion you choose: horizonta lly, vertica lly, or diagonally. It 
can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid s urface. The 
wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet 
thick. The wall blocks line of s ight, but creatures and ob 
jects can pass through it.  It emits bright light out to 120 
feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet. 

When the wall appears, each creature in its  area must 

make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 
1  minute. On a s uccessful save, it takes ha lf as much 
damage and is n't blinded. A blinded creature can make 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

A creature that e nds its turn in the wall's area takes 

4d8 radiant damage. 

Until the spell  ends, you can use an action to launch a 
beam of radiance from  the wall at one creature you can 
see within 60 feet of it.  Make a ranged spell  a ttack. On 
a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you 
hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If 
the wall's length drops to 0  feet, the spell ends. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell  using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage  increases by 
ld8 for each s lot level above 5th. 

WALL OF SAND 
3rd-level evocation 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a 
point you can see within range. You can make the wall 

up to 30 feet long,  10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it 
vanishes when the spell  ends. It blocks line of sight but 
not movement. A creature  is blinded while in  the wall's 
space and must spend 3 feet of movem ent for every 1 
foot it moves there. 

WALL OF WATER 
3rd-level evocation 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a drop of water) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

You  create a wall of water on the ground at a  point you 
can see within range. You  can make the wall  up to 30 
feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can  make 
a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 
1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell  ends. The 
wall's space is difficult terrain. 

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space 

has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage 
is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall  to 
reach its  target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass 
through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass 
through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is 
frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section  has AC  5 and 
15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points 
destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water 
doesn't fi ll  it. 

WARDING WIND 
2nd-level evocation

10-foot radius a nd moves with you, remaining centered 
on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration. 

The wind has the following effects: 

•  It deafens you and other creatures in its area . 
•  It extinguishes unprotected flames in  its area that are 

torch-sized or s ma ller. 

•  It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed 

by s trong wind. 

•  The area is  difficult terrain for creatures 

other than you. 

•  The attack rolls  of ranged weapon attacks have disad 

vantage if the attacks pass in o r out of the wind. 

WATERY SPHERE 
4th-level conjuration 

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Components: V, S, M (a droplet of water) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure  up a sphere of water with a  5-foot radius at 
a  point you can see within range. The sphere can hover 
but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere re 
mains for the spell's duration. 

Any creature in the sphere's s pace must make a 

Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature 
is ejected from  that space to the  nea rest unoccupied 
space of the creature's choice outside the sphe re. A 
Huge or la rger creature succeeds on the saving throw 
a utomatically,  and a La rge or s ma ller creature can 
choose to fa il  it.  On a fai led save, a creature  is restra ined 
by the sphere a nd  is engul fed  by t he water. At the end of 
each of its turns, a  restrained target can repeat the sav 
ing throw, ending the effect on itself on a s uccess. 

The s phere ca n restra in as ma ny as four Medium or 
s ma ller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere 
restrains a creature that causes it to exceed th is capac 
ity, a ra ndom creat ure  that was a lready restrained  by the 
sphere fa lls  out of it a nd lands prone in a space within 5 
feet of it. 

As an action, you can move  the s phere up to  30 feet 
in a straight line. If it moves over a  pit, a cliff, or other 
drop-off, it safely descends unti l it is hovering 10 feel 
a bove the ground. Any creature  restrained by the sphere 
moves w ith it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, 
forci ng them to ma ke the saving throw. 

When the spell  e nds, the sphe re  fa lls  to the g round 
and exti nguis hes all  normal fl ames within 30 feet of it. 
Any creature  restrained by the sphe re is knocked prone 
in  the s pace w here it fa lls. The water then vanishes.

spell ends . When a creature sta rts  its turn restrained by 
the whirlwind, the creatu re  is pu lled 5  feet higher inside 
it, unless t he creature  is at the top. A restra ined creature 
moves with t he whirlwind and fal ls when the spell  ends, 
unless the creatu re  has some means to s tay a loft. 

A restrained creature ca n use a n action to make a 
Strength or Dexte rity check against your spell save DC.

CHAPTER  3  I  SPELLS 

APPENDIX A:  SHARED  CAMPAIGNS 

Coordinating a  regular schedule of D&D game sessions, 
to keep a campaign active and vibrant, can be a chal 
lenge. If the campaign's only Dungeon Master or enough 
playe rs aren't available, the  next session might have to 
be pos tponed, and repeated problems of this sort can 
endange r the continuation of the campaign. 

In short: in a world filled with distractions, it can be 
hard to keep a campa ign going. Enter the concept of the 
sha red campaign. 

In a s hared campaign, more than one member of the 
group can take on the role of DM. A s hared campaign is 
episodic rather than continuous, with each play session 
compris ing a complete adventure. 

The largest shared campaigns are administered by 
the D&D Adventurers League and overseen by Wizards 
of the Coast. You can also create your own s hared cam 
pa ign for a school D&D club, at a game store, a libra ry, 
or anywhere else where D&D players and DMs gather. 
A shared campaign establis hes a framework that a l 
lows a  player to  take a character from one DM's game 
to a nother one within the shared campaign. It creates a 
s ituation where almost nothing can prevent a scheduled 
session from  happening. T he roster of potentia l players 
can be qu.ite large, virtually ens uring that any session 
has at least the minimum number of characters  needed 
to play. If everyone shows up to  play at the same time, 
multiple DMs ens ure that everyone can take part. 

CODE OF CO N DUCT 

Time and time again, the core rulebooks come back to 
the point that the most important goal of a D&D play ses 
s ion  is for everyone  involved to have fun . In keeping with 
that goal , it's a good idea  for a shared campaign to have 
a code of conduct.  Because people who don't normally 
play together might end up at the same table in  a shared 
campaign, it can  be helpful to establish some ground rules 
for be havior. 

On the broadest level, everyone in  a shared campaign 
is  responsible for  making sure that everyone else has an 
enjoyable time. If anyone feels offended, belittled, or bul 
lied by the actions of another person, the e ntire purpose of 
getting together to play is defeated . 

The basic code of conduct for a shared campaign  might 
be modeled on a  similar document that another organiza 
tion or location uses. Beyond  that, some special policies 
might need to be added to account for what might happen 
at the table when players and  DMs  interact. As a starting 
point, consider the following  material, which  is  excerpted 
from  the Adventurers League code of conduct. 

During a  play session, participants are expected to ... 

•  Follow the DM's lead and refrain  from  arguing with the 

DM  or other playe rs ove r rules. 

•  Let other players speak, and allow other players to get 

attention from the OM . 

•  Avoid excessive conversation that is not relevant to the 

adventure. 

•  Discourage others from usi ng social media to bully, 

shame, or intimidate other participants. 

•  Make the DM  or the campaign's admin istrators aware 

of disruptive o r aggressive be havior so that a ppropriate 
action can be taken. 

APPENDIX A  f SHARED  CAMPAIGNS 

In order to be s uccessful, a s hared campaign needs 

a champion-someone who takes on the responsibil 
ity of organizing and maintai ning the group. U you're 
interested in learning more about how to run a s hared 
cam paign and seeing how the Adventurers League 
handles certa in issues, then the rest of this appendix is 
meant for you. 

DESIGNING ADVENTURES 
Designi ng adventures for a shared campaign involves a 
different set of cons iderations than designing for a s ta n 
dard group of players. Most important, the adventure 
must be  timed to conclude when the session  is sched 
uled to end. You also need to balance combat encounters 
for  a range of levels, since a wide range of cha racters 
might be experiencing the adventure at the same  time. 

ADVENTURE DURATION 

Every adventure in a s hared campaign begins and ends 
in  the same play session. (If a group of participa nts 
wants to take longer to finish and all are wiJling to do 
so, they can exceed the time li mit.) A session or an event 
can't e nd with the adven ture  unfinished, since there's  no 
way to guarantee that the same players a nd DM wi ll  be 
ava ilable  for the next session. 

Typically, adventures in a shared campaign a re de 
s igned to take either 2 hours  or 4  hours. In each hour of 
play, assume  the characters can complete the following: 

•  Three or four s imple combat e ncounters, or one or 

two complex ones 

•  Three or fou r scenes involving significant exploration 

or social interaction 

Within these constra ints, it can be d ifficul t to create 
open-ended adventures. A time limit assumes a specific 
starting point a nd endpoint. A good way to get around 
this restric tion is to create an adventure with multiple 
possible endings. 

Location-based adventures also work well with this 
format. A dungeon presents a natural limit on character 
options, while strn giving the players choices. The ad 
venture could be a quest to defeat a creature or recover 
an item, but the path to achieving that goal can be diffe r 
ent for each group. 

For more  narrative adventures, try to focus on s imple 

but flexible encounters or events. For instance, a n ad 
venture requires the characters  to protect a  high  priest 
of Tyr from assassins . Give the players a cha nce to plan 
out how they want to protect the temple, complete with 
authority over the guards. A few well-fleshed out NPCs, 
some of whom might be s uspected of working with the 
temple's  enem ies, add a layer of tension. Cons ider leav 
ing some details or plot points  for the DM to decide. For 
example, the DM might have the option to pick which 
member of the  temple guards  is  the traitor, ensuring 
that the scenario is different for each group. 

COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 
Design your adventure  for one of t he  four tie rs, as set 
forth in chapter  1 of the Player's Handbook: tier 1 in 
cludes levels  1- 4 , tier 2 is levels 5- 10, tier 3  is levels 
11-16, a nd tier 4  includes levels  17- 20. Within each tie r, 
it's  a good idea to use a s pecific level as a starting point. 
Assume a  pa rty of five  3rd-level ch aracters for tie r 1, five 
8th-level cha racters  fo r tier 2, five  13th-level characters 
for tier 3, and five  18th-level characters for tier 4. Use 
that assumption when creating combat e ncounte rs, 
whether you use the e ncounter-bui lding rules in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide or are making an estimate. 

For each  battle, provide guidelines to  help DMs adjust 

the difficulty up or down to match stronger or wea ker 
parties. As a rule of thumb, account for a  pa rty two 
levels higher and for a party two levels  lower, and don't 
worry about balancing the adventure  for parties outside 
the adventure's tier. 

REWARDS 
Adventures in a shared campaign that uses variant rules 
for gai ning levels a nd acquiring treas ure (such as those 
descr ibed below) don't include exp erience point awards 
or speci fic amounts and kinds of treasure. 

CHARACTER CREATION 
A shared ca mpaign's  gu ide lines for cha racter creation 
might include definition of which races a nd classes 
players can choose  from , how players generate abi li ty 
scores, a nd which alignments playe rs  ca n c hoose. 

PLAYER' S  HANDBOOK PLUS  ONE 
You  should thi n k about which  products playe r s can use 
to create a  character. The Adventurers League specifies 
that a player can use  the Player's Handbook and one 
other official D&D source, such as a  book or a PDF, to 
create a character. This restriction e ns ures that players 
don't need  to own a lot of books to make  a c ha racter 
a nd makes it easie r  for  DMs to know how all th e char 
acters in  the campaign work. S ince a DM in a shared 
campaign must deal with a broad range of characters, 
rather than the sa me characters each week, it can be dif 
fic ul t to track all  the inte ractions and abil ities possible 
through mixing options  freely. We strongly recomme nd 
th is  ru le  fo r any shared campaign. 

ABILITY SCORES 
For generating abil ity scores, we recomme nd allowing 
playe rs  to choose between the standard array- 15, 14, 
13, 12, 10, 8-and the option presented in  "Variant: 
Customizing Abi lity Scores" in chapter  1 of the Play 
er's Handbook. 

STARTING EQUIPMENT 
For the sake of simplicity a nd e fficiency, it's a good 
idea to requ ire that beginning characters must take the 
starting equipment specified by a character's class a nd 
background. 

VARIANT RULES 
A shared campaig n might use some va riant rules to 
handle certain aspects of th e game. The Adventure rs 
League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining 
levels and acquiring treasure. These "house rules," 
presented below, serve as a sort of common language, 
e n surin g tha t the  rewa rds a ll  characters  receive are 
eq uivale nt no matter what kind of adventure a character 
experienced. 

CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT 
In a s ha red campaign , characters gain levels  not by 
accumulating experience points but by reaching experi 
e nce checkpoints. This system rewards every character 
(and  player) for taking part in a  play session. 

~~~~~~~~-

A character reaches 1 c heckpoint for each hour an 
adventure is designed to last. Note t hat the award is 
based on the adventure's  projected playing time, rathe r 
than the actual time spent at t he table. The  reward for 
comple ting an adventure designed fo r 2  hours of play is 
2 c heckpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours 
playing  through it. 

If a c haracter completes an adventu re designed  for a 

tie r hig her than the character's cu rre nt tier, the c ha r 
acter is awarded 1 additional checkpoint. For example, 
if a  2nd-level cha racter completes a  6th-level adven 
ture designed to take 2  hours, the c haracter reaches 3 
c heckpoints. 

P laying time m ight seem li ke a n odd way to  measure 

experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with 
how a s hared campaign is meant to work. A character 
played for  10 hours reaches the same number of check 
points, whether the c haracter went up against a  dragon 
or spen t all that time lurking in a  pub. Th is  approach en 
sures that a player's preferred style is  neither pe nalized 
nor rewa rded. Whe ther someone  focuses on roleplaying 
and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, 
or finding clever ways to avoid battles, t his system gives 
credit whe re credit is due. 

USING  CHECKPOINTS 
The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level 
depends on a character's level: 
•  At levels  1- 4,  reaching 4 c heckpoi nts is sufficient to 

advance to the next level. 

•  At  level 5 o r highe r, reaching 8 checkpoints  is needed 

to advance to the next level. 

At the e nd of a play session, cha racters must level up 
if they have reached e nough checkpoints  to do so. The 
required number of c heckpoints is ex pe nded, and a ny 
remaining checkpoints are applied  toward the next op 
portunity for advancement. 

INDIVIDUAL TREASURE 
In a shared campaign, each cha racter receives a fixed 
number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level.  (This 
gain represents the  treasu re a character might find  in a 
sta ndard adventure.) 

As an add it ional benefit, c haracters are not required 
to put out gold  to mainta in a  lifestyle. Instead, each cha r-

1\PPEND IX  A  I SHARED  CAMPAIGNS 

acter begins with a modest lifestyle, which improves as 
the character attains  higher levels. 

These benefits are s ummarized on the Individual 

Treasure table. Ways for characters to s pend their 
treasure are covered in the  "Buying and Selling" sec 
tion below.

MAGIC  ITEMS 

Characters earn treasure points from adventures, then 
redeem those points in exchange for magic items. The 
list of available magic items is agreed to and compiled 
by the DMs  running the campaign. 

GAINING TREASURE POINTS 
Each character earns  treasure points  based on an ad 
venture's  tier and its intended playing time: 

•  1 treasure point is awa rded for every 2 hours  played in 

a tier 1 or tier 2 adventure. 

•  1 treasure point is awarded for every 1 hour played in 

a tier 3 or tier 4 adventure. 

As with the varia nt r ules for gaining levels, this award is 
based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather 
than the actual time a group s pent at the table. 

If a character completes an adventure of a tier higher 
tha n that character's tie r,  the character receives 1 addi 
tional treasure  point for that adventure. 

CREATING AN  ITEM  LIST 
T he DMs of the s hared ca mpaign s hould work together 
to compile a lis t of magic items  that players can pur 
chase. The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book 
and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide a re the 
obvious starting point. Choosing which ite ms to allow 
or ban is a  matte r of personal preference, just as it is  for 
the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs 
helps  to ensure that the  lis t meets everyone's expecta 
tions. Whe n in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add 
it to the available ite ms at a later time than it would be to 
remove it from the game once it has  been handed out. 
Naturally,  the  list of available ite ms  is  longer for ad 
ventures in  the higher tiers, a nd the point cost of those 
higher-tier items  likewise increases. The Magic [terns  by 
Tier table provides the details . 

For ins tance, treasure points  from a tier 1 adventure 

can be s pent on items  from tables A, B, C, and F. Any 
item on the firs t th ree tables costs 4  points, and an item 
from table F costs 8  points.

SPEN DING TREASU RE  POINTS 
P layers mus t s pend  treasure  points at the e nd of a play 
session, immediately after determining whether their 
characters  have gained a level. The order of these s teps 
is important, since a cha racter might enter a new tier 
because of the level gain. 

P layers a re entitled to choose any approved item from 
one of the magic item tables available in  the current tier. 
Treasure points can be s pread across  multiple  items . 
Many items cost more treasure points  than a charac 
ter can earn in a  2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy s uch an 
item, a cha racter can make a deposit, spending treasure 
points on the item until it's paid off, at which time the 
cha racter gains the item. 

BUYING AND  SELLING 

Cha racte rs can use their monetary treasure to  purchase 
a nything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the 
Player's Handbook. In add ition, the Adventurers League 
a llows characters to purchase potions  and sp ell scrolls, 
as detailed below. A spell scroll can be purchased 
o nly by a character who is  capable of casting the s pell 
in question.

SELLING ITEMS 
In a s hared campaig n, characte rs are not entitled to sell 
items  they find  on adve ntures or equipment they pur 
chase with their personal funds . Weapons, armor, a nd 
other gear used  by enemies are cons idered too damaged 
to have a ny moneta ry value. 

APPENDIX B:  CHARACTER NAMES 
Some players and DMs have a  knack for coming up with 
character names on the fly,  wh ile others  find  that task 
more of a challenge. T he  tables in this appendix a re 
designed to make life easier for both kinds of people, 
whether you're naming a  player cha rac ter, a nonplayer 
character, a  monster, or even a  place . 

Each table contains names that are associated with 
a nonhuman character race in the Player's Handbook 
or a  real-world ethnic or language group, with a focus 
on groups fro m antiquity and the Midd le Ages. You can 

select from  the  possibilities here, or use dice to deter 
mine a name. 

Even though names are associated with races in  th is 
appendix, a character might not have a  name from their 
own race. For ins tance, a  ha lf-o re might have grown up 
among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM, 
you might decide that dragon born in your campaign 
have a culture reminiscent of ancient Rome and there 
fore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn 
names s ugges ted here.
