Luckily. just as 0&0 can strengthen your friendships,

it can help build in you the confidence to create and
share. 0&0 is a game that teaches you to look for the
clever solution, share the sudden ide a that can overcome
a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be,
rather than simply accept what is.

The first characters

and adventures you create will

probably be a collection of clichés. That's true of every-
one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on
down. Accept this rea!ity and move on to create the
second character or adventure, which will be betler,
and then the third, which will be betler still. Repeat
that
over the course of time, and soon you'lI be able to create

Once you have that skill, it's yours forever. Countless
writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin-
nings to a few pages of 0&0 notes, a handful of dice,
and a kitchen table.

Above ali else, 0&0 is yours. The friendships you

make around the table will be unique to you. The adven-
tures you embark on. the characters you create,

HEDUNGEONS& DRAGONSROLEPLAYING
game is about storytelling in worlds of
swords and sorcery. !t shares elements
with childhood games of make-believe. Like
those games, 0&0 is driven by imagina-
tion. !t's about picturing the towering castle
beneath the stormy night sky and imagining

howa fantasy adventurer might react
that scene presents.

to the challenges

Oungeon Master (OM): After passing through the
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling

towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these,
a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep
fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm,
leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.
The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their
rust.eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop
the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you
from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting
wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the
entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors ofCastle
Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into
the courtyard.

Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the

gargoyles. I have a feeling they're not just statues.

Amy(playing Rival:The drawbridge looks precarious?
I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross
it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?

Unlike a game of make-believe, 0&0 gives structure

to the stories, a way of determining the consequences
of the adventurers'
action. Players roll dice to resolve
their attacks hit or miss or whether
whether
turers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a
magicallightning
bolt, or pull off some other dangerous
task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some out-
comes more probable than others.

Oungeon Master (OM): OK, one at a time. Phillip,

you're looking at the gargoyles?

Phillip: Yeah. 15 there any hint they might be

creatures and not decorations?

OM: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?

(played by friends).

In the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame, each player
(also called a character) and

creates an adventurer
teams up with other adventurers
Working together,
the group might explore a dark dun-
geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle. a lost temple deep
in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavero beneath a mysterious
mountain. The adventurers

can solve puzzles,

One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon

Master (DM). the game's lead storyteller and referee.
The DM creates adventures
for the characters, who nav-
igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The
DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,
and the players decide what they want their adventurers
to do. WilI they walk across the dangerously weathered
drawbridge? Tie themselves
together with rope to mini-
mize the chance that someone will fali if the drawbridge
gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?

Then the DM determines

the results of the adventur-

ers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because
the DM can improvise to react
to anything the players
attempt, 0&0 is infinitely f1exible, and each adventure
can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing
story called a campaign. Many people who play the
game keep their campaigns going for months or years.
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick
up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow
in might as the campaign continues. Each monster
defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasurc
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also
earos the adventurers new capabilities. This increase
in power is reflected by an adventurer's

leveI.

There's no winning and losing in the DUNGEONS&
DRAGONSgame-at
least, not the way those terms are
usually understood. Together, the DM and lhe players
create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront
deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to
a grisly end, toro apart by ferocious monsters or done in
bya nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade,
or the player might choose to create a new character
to
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created
a memorable story, they ali win.

and magic that make these worlds unique.

The worlds of the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame exist
within a vast cosmos called the multiverse,
connected
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to
other planes of existence. such as the Elemental Plane
of Fire and the lnfinite Depths of the Abyss. Within

lNTRODUl TION

this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many
of them have been published as official settings for the
D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag-
onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron
settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi-
verse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands
more, created by generations of D&D players for their
own games. And amid ali the richness of the multiverse,
you might create a world of your own.

Ali these worlds share characteristics,

but each world

for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals,

is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive
monsters and races, fantastic geography, anciem dun-
geons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun
setting,
and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature
races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron's war-
forged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in
the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great
story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central
role
in the Dragonlance setting. But they're ali D&D worlds,
and you can use the rules in this book to create a char-
acter and play in any one of them.

Your DM might set the campaign on one of these
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there
is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you
should check with your DM about any house rules that
will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dun-
geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its
setting, even if the setting is a published world.

Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the

rules and guidance you need to make the character

other customization options that you can choose from.

2. The players describe what

they want

to do. Some-

times one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
"We'lI take the east door," for example. Other times,
different adventurers do different
things: one adventurer
might search a treasure chest while a second examines
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
watch for monsters. The players don't need to take
turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides
how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes,

resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
wants to walk across a roam and open a door, the DM
might just say that the door opens and describe what
lies beyond. But the doar might be locked, the floor
might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance
might make it challenging for an adventurer

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's
verbal descriptions
to set the scene. Some DMs like to
use music, art, ar recorded sound effects to help set the
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other
characters
they play in the game. Sometimes,
might lay out a map and use tokens ar miniature figures
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help
the players keep track of where everyone is.

GAME DrCE

The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers
of sides. Vou can find dice like these in game stores and
in many bookstores.
In these rules,

the different dice are referred to by the
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, dS, dI O,
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
typical cube that many games use).

Percentile dice, ar d100, work a little differently. Vou

ten-sided dice numbered from Oto 9. One die

different

the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for
example,
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and I is 71,
and 00 and O is 100.

rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100.

the number

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how
many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what mod-
ifiers to add. For example, "3dS + 5" means you roll

three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5
to the tota!.

The same d notation appears

in the expressions

cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain,
the DUNGEONS& DRAGONSgame relies on rolls of a

The target number

for an ability check or a saving

This sim pie rule governs the resolution of most tasks
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
using the d20 in the game.

ar some

This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3,
that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial
traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abili-
ties, and other game elements break the general ruIes in
some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the
game works. Remember
this: lf a specific ruIe contra-
dicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance,
many adventurers don't have proficiency with longbows,
but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That
trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other
examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For
instance, an adventurer can't normally pass through
walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic
accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

ROUND DOWN

There's one more general rule you need to know at the
outset. Whenever you divide a number
in the game,
round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the
fraction is one-half or greater.

THE WONDERS OF MAGIC

Few D&D adventures end without something magical
happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magie appears
frequently in the life of an advenlurer, and it is the focus
of chapters 10 and 11.

In the worlds of DUNGEONS& DRAGONS,practitioners
of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people
by their extraordinary
talent. Common foIk l11ightsee

Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven-

tures are driven by the machinations of spellcaslers
who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult
leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath
the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them
of lheir vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of
automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a

At 1st levei, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the
die type is determined by your c1ass. Vou start with hit
points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in
your c1ass description.
(You also add your Constitution
modifier, which you'lI determine in step 3.) This is also
your hit poiot maximum.

Record your character's hit points on your character

sheet. AIso record the type of Hit Die your character
uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you
rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see
"Resting" in chapter 8).

Your c1ass determines your weapon proficiencies,
your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill
and tool proficiencies.
(Skills are described in chapter 7,
tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional
skill and toa I proficiencies, and some races give
you more proficiencies. Be sure to note ali of these
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your
character

sheet.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die
roll ar other number more than once. Occasionally, your
proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled ar halved,
for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than
once to the same roll ar that it should be multiplied
more than once, you nevertheless
add it only once,
multiply it only once, and halve it only once.

BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 2
Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battIe with an axe,
one horo on his helmet broken ofr. He makes Bruenor a
fighter and notes the fighter's proficiencies and 1st-leveI
c1ass features on his character

sheet.

As a 1st-leveI fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die-a d 10-
and starts with hit points equal to la + his Constitution
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final
number after he determines Bruenor's Constitution
score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus
for a 1st-levei character, which is +2.

3. DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES

After assigning your ability scores, determine

your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and
Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without
consulting the table, subtract 10 fram the ability score
and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the
modifier next to each of your scores.

BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 3
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14,
13, 12, 10,8) for Bruenor's abilities. Since he's a fighter,
he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-
highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a
brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to
be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent
scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his
racial benefits (increasing Bruenor's Constitution by
2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor's ability scores and
modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10
(+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-I), Wisdom 13
(+1), Charisma 12 (+1).
Bob fills in Bruenor's

final hit points: 10 + his

Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.

VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES
At your Dungeon Master's option, you can use this
variant for determining your ability scores. The method
described here allows you to build a character with a set
of ability scores you choose individually.

Vou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores.
The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score
Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7
points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score
you can end up with, before applying racial increases.
Vou can't have a score lower than 8.

This method of determining ability scores enables
you to create a set of three high numbers and three low
that are above
ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers

Your character's background

describes where he or

character's place in the D&D world. Your DM might
offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included

13

in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to
craft a background that's a more precise fit for your
character concept.

A background gives your character a background
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills,
and it might also give you additionallanguages
or
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this
information, along with the personality information
you develop, on your character sheet.

YOUR CHARACTER'S ABILITIES
Take your character's ability scores and race into
account as you flesh out his or her appearance
and personality. A very strong character with low
Intelligence might think and behave very differently
from a very smart character with low Strength.

For example, high Strength usually corresponds
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with
low Strength might be scrawny or plump.

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and

slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be
either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.

A character with high Constitution usually looks

healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A
character with low Constitution might be sickly or frai!.
A character with high Intelligence might be highly
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low
Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
A character with high Wisdom has good judgment,
empathy, and a general awareness of what's going on.
A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded,
foolhardy, or oblivious.

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,
which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
presence. A character with a low Charisma might come
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or tímido

BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 4
Bob fills in some of Bruenor's basic details: his name,
his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment
(Iawful good). His high Strength and Constitution
suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence
suggests a degree of forgetfulness.

Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line,

but his elan was expelled from its homeland when
Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith
in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor
has a heroic destiny-to reelaim his homeland-so
Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.
He notes the proficiencies and special feature this
background gives him.

Bob has a pretty elear picture of Bruenor's personality

in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is
a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff,
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness
from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor
believes that no one is above the law.

Given his history, Bruenor's bond is obvious: he

aspires to someday reelaim Mithral Hall, his homeland,
from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.

His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature-he
soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to
show mercy even when it might not be warranted.

to spend based on your elass, as shown in chapter 5.
Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in
that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket
at no cost (see the trinket table at the end of chapter 5).
Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.

ARMOR CLASS
Your Armor Class (AC)represents how well your
character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that
contribute to your AC inelude the armor you wear, the
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not ali
characters wear armor or carry shields, however.

Without armor or a shield, your character's AC equals

10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your
AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on
your character sheet.

Your character needs to be proficient with armor and
shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
and shield proficiencies are determined by your elass.
There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained
in chapter 5.

Some spells and elass features give you a different
way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features
that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you
choose which one to use.

WEAPONS
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the
modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and
the damage you deal when you hit.

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate
ability modifier.

For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your
Dexterity modifier instead.
For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon thal
has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use
your Strength modifier inslead.

SHORT AND STOUT

Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as
skilled warriors, miners, and workers
of stone and melaI. Though lhey sland
well under 5 feel tall, dwarves are so
broad and compael lhal lhey can weigh
as much as a human slanding nearly lwo
feet laller. Their courage and endurance
are also easily a maleh for any of
lhe larger folk.

Owarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
hue linged wilh red, bul lhe most eommon shades are
lighl brown or deep lan, like cerlain lones of earlh.
Their hair, worn long bul in simple slyles, is usually
black, gray, or brown, lhough paler dwarves oflen have
red hair. Male dwarves value lheir beards highly and
groom lhem carefully.

LONG MEMORY, LONG GRUDGES

Owarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so lhe
oldesl living dwarves often remember a very differenl
world. For example, some of lhe oldesl dwarves living
in Ciladel Felbarr (in lhe world of lhe Forgotten Realms)
can recall lhe day, more lhan three cenluries ago, when
ores conquered lhe forlress and drove lhem into an exile
lhal lasled over 250 years. This longevity granls lhem a

humans and halflings lack.

CLANS AND KINGDOMS

Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains

artistry of precious metais and fine jewelry, and in some
dwarves this lave festers into avarice. Whatever wealth

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests
ar in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where
soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances
waft on the breeze. Elves lave nature and magic, art
and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things
of the world.

With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves
appear hauntingly beautiful
of many other races. They are slightly shorter

humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet
tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender

A TIMELESS PERSPECTIVE
Elves can live weIl over 700 years, giving them a broad

The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings'
lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from
marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing tire
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
Though some halflings live out their days in remote .
agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands
that travei constantly, lured by the open road and the
wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and
peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food,
hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon
jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

SMALL ANO PRACTICAL

The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear re1atively
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing
between 40 and 45 pounds.

Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy

cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among
them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear
simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring
bright colors.

Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.

They're concerned with basic needs and simple
pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the
wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a
cellar rather than on display for ali to see. They have
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

KINO ANO CURIOUS

Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few
dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among
them usually venture into the world for reasons of

humans, dwarves, ar elves, making themselves valuable

Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal
to their friends, whether halfling ar otherwise. They can
display remarkable
ferocity when their friends, families,
ar communities

are threatened.

PASTORAL PLEASANTRIES

Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with
large farms and well-kept graves. They rarely build
kingdoms of their own ar even hold much land beyond
their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any
sort of halfling nobility ar royalty, instead looking to
family elders to guide them. Families preserve their
traditional ways despite the rise and fali of empires.
Many halflings live among other races, where the

LASTING INSTITUTIONS

Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the
responsibility of guarding a speciallocation or a
powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and
institutions for such purposes. While dwarf c1ans and
halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each
new generation, human temples, governments, Iibraries,
and codes of law fix their lradilions in lhe bedrock of
history. Humans dream of immorlality, but (excepl for
lhose few who seek undeath or divine ascension to
escape dealh's c1utches) they achieve il by ensuring that
they will be remembered when lhey are gone.

not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with
power ali their own. The bard is a master of song,
speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
that the multiverse was spoken into existence,
words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these
primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout
the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt

The greatest strength of bards is their sheer

versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and
hinder their foes fram a distance. But bards are capable
of defending themselves
in melee if necessary, using
their magic to bolster their swords and armar. Their
spells lean toward charms and illusions rather
than
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging
knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude
that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become
masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting,
from musical performance

to esoteric knowledge.

or not. Your character's background and motivations

SPELLCASTING

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the cleric spelllist.

CANTRIPS
At 1st levei, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spelllist. Vou learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher leveis, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st levei and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's levei
or higher. Vou regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.

Vou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spelllist. When
you do 50, choose a number of cleric spells equal to
your Wisdom modifier + your cleric levei (minimum of
one spell). The spells must be of a leveI for which you
have spell slots.
For example,

if you are a 3rd-Ievel c1eric, you have four

1st-levei and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With a Wisdom
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination.
]f you prepare
the 1st-levei spell cure wounds, you can cast it using
a 1st-levei or 2nd-levei slot. Casting the spell doesn't
remove it from your list of prepared spells.

PART 1 I CLASSES

Vou can change your list of prepared spells when you

finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells
requires
minute per spelllevel

for each spell on your listo

in prayer and meditation: at least 1

SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. Vou use your Wisdom whenever a c1eric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

RITUAL CASTING
Vou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

SPELLCASTING Focus
Vou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

DIVINE DOMAIN

Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each
domain is detailed at the end of the class description,
and each one provides examples of gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and olher
features when you choose it at 1st leveI. It also grants
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
gain that feature at 2nd levei, and additional benefits at
6th, 8th, and 17th leveis.

DOMAIN SPELLS
Each domain has a list of spells-its
domain spells-
that you gain at the c1eric leveis noted in the domain
description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn't count against
number of spells you can prepare each day.

the

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the
cleric spelllist, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for YOU.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

At 2nd levei, you gain the ability to channel divine
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
magical effects. Vou start with two such effects: Turn
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some
domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
leveis, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity. you choose
which effect to create. Vou must then finish a short or
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

When you use such an effect from this class,
equals your c1eric spell save DC.

the DC

Beginning at 6th leveI, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th levei,

you can use it three times between rests. When you finish
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

TURN UNDEAD

CHANNEL DIVINITY:
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move

as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly
move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th leveI, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th leveI, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

DESTROY UNDEAD

Starting at 5th leveI, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature,
the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

DIVINE INTERVENTION

Beginning at 10th levei, you can call on your deity to
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

1mploring your deity's aid requires you to use your

action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal
to or lower
than your cleric leveI, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature of the intervention;
the effect of any
cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
lf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
you finish a long rest.

At 20th leveI, your call for intervention succeeds

automatically, no roll required.

DIVINE DOMAINS
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different
aspects of mortallife
and civilization, called a deity's
domain. Ali the domains over which a deity has
influence are called the deity's portfolio. For example,
the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the

domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you
choose one aspect of your deity's portfolio to emphasize,
and you are granted powers related to that domain.

Your choice might correspond to a particular

worshiped in one region as Phoebus ("radiant") Apollo,
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain,
and in a different place as Apollo Acesius ("healing"),
emphasizing his association with the Life domain.
Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a
malter of personal preference,
that appeals to you most.

Each domain's description gives examples of deities
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included

CREATING

A DRUID

When making a druid, consider why your character has
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character
lives in a society where the Old Faith slill thrives, or was
raised bya druid after being abandoned in the depths
of a forcst. Perhaps your character had a dramatic
encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to
face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving lhe
experience. Maybe your character was born during an
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreled

as a sign that becoming a druid
was part of your character's destiny.

Have you aJways been an adventurer
as part of your druidic calling, or did you
first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred
grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was
befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in
hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

QUICK BUILD
VOU can make a druid quickly by following these
suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose
the hermit background.

SPELLCASTING

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See
chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

CANTRIPS
At 1st levei, you know two cantrips of your choice from

SACREO PLANTS ANO WOOO
Adruid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularlyalder,
ash, birch,elder, hazel, holly,juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan,
willow,and yew.Druids often use such plants as part of a
spellcastíng focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yewor
sprigs of mistletoe.

Similarly,a druid uses such woods to make other objects,
such as weapons and shields. Yewis assocíated wíth death
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might
be fashioned from il. Ash is assocíated with lifeand oak
with strength. These woods make excellenthafts or whole
weapons, such as c1ubsor quarterstaffs, as wellas shields.
Alderis assocíated wíth air,and it might be used for thrown
weapons,

such as darts or javelins.

Druids from regions that lackthe plants described here

have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For
instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca
tree and cactus plants.

DRUID CIRCLES
Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders,
druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring
political borders, Ali druids are nominally members
of this druidic society, though some individuais are so
isolaled lhat lhey have never seen any high-ranking
members of the society or participated in druidic
gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and
sislers, Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids
somelimes compete with or even prey on each other,

At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that
share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the
way of the druid,

CIRCLE OF THE LAND

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through
a vast oral tradition, These druids meet within sacred
circles of trees or standing slones to whisper primai
secrets in Druidic, The circle's wisest members preside
as the chief priests of communities
lhat hold to the Old
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk,
As a member of this circle, your magic is inl1uenced

mysterious

rites.

additional druid cantrip of your choice.

ELDRITCH KNIGHT

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial
mastery common to ali fighters with a careful study of
similar
magic. Eldritch Knights use magical
to those practiced by wizards, They focus their study

techniques

on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively
small number of spells, committing them to memory
instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

SPELLCASTING
When you reach 3rd levei, you augment your martial
prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for
the wizard spelllist.

Cantrips. Vou learn two cantrips of your choice fram

the wizard spell list. Vou learn an additional wizard
cantrip of your choice at 10th leveI.

SpeJl Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table

shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st leveI and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's levei or
higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example,

if you know the Ist.level spell shieId and

have a Ist.level and a 2nd.level spell slot available, you
can cast shieId using either slot.

SpeJls Known of 1st-LeveI and Higher. Vou know
three 1st.level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation
spells on the wizard spelllist.

The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight
Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard
spells of 1st levei or higher. Each of these spells must be
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
be of a leveI for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th levei in this c1ass, you can learn one
new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th leveI can

come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a leveI in this c1ass, you can

replace one of the wizard spells you know with another
spell of your choice from lhe wizard spelllist. The
new spell must be of a leveI for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell,
unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th,
or 20th leveI.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting

ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your
spells through study and memorization. Vou use your
lntelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier
when setting lhe saving throw De for a wizard spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.

PALADIN
Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite
the dust and grime of long travei, a human lays down
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally
wounded mano Divine radiance shines from her hands,
the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide
with amazement.

A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak

making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently,
he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two
orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.

Silver hair shining in a shaft of !ight that seems to
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its
hideous darkness.

Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are
united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil.
Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey
beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful
bond. lt is a source of power that turns a devout warrior
into a blessed champion.

THE CAUSE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness,
to stand with the good things of the world against the
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to
gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a
commitment

to justice itself as it does from a god.

Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat,

mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.

BEYOND THE MUNDANE LIFE

Almost by definition, the !ife of a paladin is an
adventuring !ife. Unless a lasting injury has taken him

Vou can use this feature a number of times equal to

you regain ali expended uses.

LAY ON HANDS

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. Vou have a pool
of healing power that replenishes when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of
hit points equal to your paladin leveI x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your

pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or
neutralize one poison affecting it. Vou can cure multi pIe
diseases and neutralize multi pIe poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately
for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

PART 1 I CLASSES

By 2nd levei, you have learned to draw on divine
magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell listo

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of
1st leveI or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's
leveI or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when
you finish a long resto

Vou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available

for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spelllist.
When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin
leveI, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a leveI for which you have spell slots.

For example,

if you are a 5th-leveI paladin, you have

four 1st-leveI and two 2nd-leveI spell slots. With a
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include
four spells of 1st or 2nd levei, in any combination.
If you
prepare the 1st-levei spell cure wounds, you can cast
it using a 1st-leveI or a 2nd-leveI slot. Casting the spell
doesn't

remove it from your list of prepared spells.
Vou can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells
requires
in prayer and meditation: at least I
minute per spelllevel

for each spell on your list.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin
spells, since their power derives from the strength of

your convictions. Vou use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
an attack roll with one.

SPELLCASTING Focus
Vou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

DIVINE SMITE

Starting at 2nd leveI, when you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell
slot to deal radiant damage to the target,
in addition to
the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a
1st-levei spell slot, plus ld8 for each spelllevel higher
than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases
by ld8 if the target

is an undead or a fiend.

DIVINE HEALTH

By 3rd levei, the divine magic flowing through you
makes you immune to disease.

SACRED OATH

When you reach 3rd leveI, you swear the oath that binds
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been
in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not
yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion,
the Oath of the Ancients, ar the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the c1ass description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd leveI and again
at 7th, 15th, and 20th leveI. Those features include oath
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

OATH SPELLS
Each oath has a list of associated spells. Vou gain
access to these spells at the leveIs specified in the oath
description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you
always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.

CHANNEL DIVINITY
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel

by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your ChanneI Divinity, you choose

which option to use. Vou must then finish a short ar long
rest

to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

When you use such an effect from this c1ass, the DC
equals your paladin spell save De.

Becorning a paladin invoIves taking vows that commit

c1ass don't consider
true paladins until

they have reached 3rd levei and made this oath. For
others,
the actual swearing of the oath is a formality,
an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin's heart.

TENETS OF DEVOTION

Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and
punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your
foes, but temper it with wisdom.

Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your

honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as

suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability

carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

CREATING A RANGER

As you create your ranger character, consider
the nature
of the training that gave you your particular capabilities.
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering lhe wilds
together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you
leave your apprenticeship,
perhaps by the same kind of monster
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle,
lore. Vou
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add
your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

SPELLCASTING

By the time you reach 2nd levei, you have learned to
use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much
as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell Iist.

SPELL SLOTS
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your spells of 1st leveI and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's leveI
or higher. Vou regain ali expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
For example,

if you know the 1st-levei spell animal

friendship and have a 1st-levei and a 2nd-leveI spell slot
available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVE L AND HIGHER
Vou know two 1st-levei spells ofyour choice from the
ranger spelllist.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows
when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each
of these spells must be of a levei for which you have

spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th levei in this
c1ass, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd leveI.
Additionally, when you gain a levei in this c1ass,
you can choose one of the ranger spells you know
and replace it with another spell from the ranger
spelllist, which also must be of a leveI for which you
have spell slots.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger
spells, since your magic draws on your attunement
to
nature. Vou use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw De for
a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.

RANGER ARCHETYPES
The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions:
Hunter and the Beast Master.

of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you

BEAST MASTER

The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship
between the civilized races and the beasts of the world.
United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight
the monstrous
wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype
means committing yourself to this ideal, working in
partnership with all animal as its companion and friend.

ROGUE
Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into
the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target-a notorious slaver-passes
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.

the alleyway,

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers
and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt.
In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
open, and she and her companions are free to make
their escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes'

vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful
adventuring party.

SKILL AND PRECISION

Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning

over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down
with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
magical tricks to supplement

their other abilities.

A SHADY LIVING
Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues
operate independently, but even they sometimes
recruit apprentices to help them in their scams
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as

Golden eyes flashing, a human

the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes,
leathery wings spread from her back and
she takes to the air.

Long hair whipped bya conjured wind,
a half.elf spreads his arms wide and throws
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off
the ground. a wave of magic surges up in him,
through him, and out from him in a mighty blast
of lightning.

Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.

SORCEROUS RESTORATION

At 20th levei, you regain 4 expended sorcery points

SORCEROUS ORIGINS
Different sorcerers c1aim different origins for their
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most
of these origins fali into two categories: a draconic
bloodline and wild magic.

DRACONIC BLOODLINE

Vour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was
mingled with your blood ar that of your ancestors. Most
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent
times who made a
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient
bargain with a dragon ar who might even have c1aimed
a dragon parenl. Some of these bloodlines are well
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact ar some other exceptional circumstance.

DRAGON ANCESTOR
At 1st levei, you choose one type of dragon as your
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon
is used by features you gain later.

CONTROLLED CHAOS
At 14th levei, you gain a modicum of control over the
surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
either number.

SPELL BOMBARDMENT
Beginning at 18th leveI, the harmful energy of your
spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and
roll the highest number possible on any of lhe dice,

DRACONIC PRESENCE
Beginning at 18th leveI, you can channel
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around
you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a
distance of 60 feel. For I minute or until you lose your
concentration (as if you were casting a concentration
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this
aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on
this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

WILD MAGIC

Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos
that underlie the order of creation. You might have
endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portalleading
Planes, or lhe mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked bya
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with
no apparent cause or reason. However it carne to be, this

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the

Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse, Through pacts

SWORN AND BEHOLDEN

A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly
being, Sometimes
the relationship between warlock
and patron is like that of a c1erie and a deity, though
the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
gods, A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity-beings

The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor

but lasting alterations
to the warlock's being (such as
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language)
to access to powerful spells, Unlike bookish wizards,
warlocks supplement
their magic with some facility
at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light
armor and know how to use simple weapons,

DELVERS INTO SECRETS

Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge
and power, which compels them into their pacts and
shapes their lives, This thirst drives warlocks into their
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves

to fiends are

widely known, Sut many warlocks serve patrons that
are not fiendish. Sometimes

Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures,
or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do
between adventures.

What kind of relationship do you have with your

patron? Is it friendly. antagonistic. uneasy. or romantic?
How important does your patron consider you to be?
What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you
know other servants of your patron?

How does your patron communicate with you? If

it might occasionally speak with

you have a familiar,
your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages
frolll their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea
leaves, or adrift in the clouds-messages
that only the
warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their
patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with
intermediaries.

QUICK BUILD
Vou can make a warlock quickly by following these
suggestions. First. Charisma should be your highest
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose
the charlatan background. Third. choose the eldritch
blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-leveI
spells ray of sickness and witch bolt.

alien beings lhat dwell in the outer void.

Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge
and power can't be slaked with mere study and research.
No one makes a pact with such a mighty palron if he or
she doesn't
intend to use the power thus gained. Rather,
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active
pursuit of their goals. which typically means some kind
of adventuring. Furthermore,
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

the demands of their

CREATING A WARLOCK

As you make your warlock character, spend some time
thinking about your patron and the obligations that
your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the
pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
Wcrc you seduced into sumllloning a devi!, or did you
seek out the ritual thal would allow you to make contact
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron,
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe
under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in
anticipation of the rewards promised to you?

Work with your DM to determine how big a part your

pact will play in your character's

adventuring career.

OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS
The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are
mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant

favors in returno
Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability
to bind mortaIs to their will. Other patrons bestow their
power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivaIs.

MYSTIC ARCANUM

THEARCHFEY

At 11th levei, your patron bestows upon you a magical
secret called an arca num. Choose one 6th-leveI spell
from the warlock spelllist as this arcanum.

Vou can cast your arca num spell once without

expending a spell slot. Vou must finish a long rest before
you can do so again.

At higher leveIs, you gain more warlock spells of your

choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th.level spell
at 13th leveI, one 8th.level spell at 15th levei, and one
9th-leveI spell at 17th leveI. Vou regain all uses of your
Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

ELDRITCH MASTER

At 20th leveI, you can draw on your inner reserve of
mystical power while entreating your patron to regain
expended spell slots. Vou can spend 1 minute entreating
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you
can do so again.

Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of
legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before
the mortal races were born. This being's motivations
are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and
might involve a striving for greater magical power or the
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness,
ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer
Court; her consort Oberon,
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

BEGUILING DEFENSES
Beginning at 10th levei, your patron teaches you how to
turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against
them. Vou are immune to being charmed, and when
another creature attempts to charm you, you can use
your reaction to attempt
that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or

WIZARD
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the
battletield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving
in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a
tiny bead of tire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a confiagration that engulfs the soldiers.

Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes

an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
fioor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.

Crouching on the fioor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.

Wizards are supreme magic-users, detined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates
the cosmos, wizards cast
spel1s of explosive tire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute.force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the
future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest
spel1s change one substance into another, cal1 meteors
down from the sky, or open portaIs to other worlds.

SCHOLARS OF THE ARCANE

the

Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function,
power of magic draws students who seek to master
its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods,
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
spel1 requires merely the utterance of a few strange
words, fieeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or
clump of exotic materiaIs,
these surface components
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship

and countless haurs of study.

Wizards live and die by their spel1s. Everything else
is secondary. They learn new spel1s as they experiment
and grow in experience. They can also learn them fram

Vou prepare the Iist of wizard spells that are available

for you to east. To do so, ehoose a number of wizard
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligenee

spells must be of a leveI for whieh you have spell slots.

Vou have learned to regain some of your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots
to recover. The spell slots can have a combined leveI that
is equal to or less than half your wizard leveI (rounded

For example, ifyou're a 4th-leveI wizard, you can recover
up to two leveIs worth of spell slots. Vou can recover either
a 2nd-leveI spell slot or two 1st-levei spell slots.

your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.

SPELL MASTERY

At 18th leveI, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a

lowest leveI without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. 1£you want to cast either spell at a

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one

or both of the spells you chose for different spells of
the same leveIs.

powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.

ARCANE TRADITIONS
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to
the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly
established in the worlds of 0&0, with various
traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions

in the multiverse

revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through

these traditions are

the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools, as described
in chapter 10. In some places,
literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of
lllusion while another studies across town at the School
of Enchantment.
the schools are
In other institutions,
more like academic departments, with rival faculties
competing for students and funding. Even wizards who
train apprentices
in the solitude of their own towers use
the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of
different

techniques.

SCHOOL OF ABJURATION

The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks,
banishes, or protects. Oetractors of this school say
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than
positive assertion. Vou understand, however, that ending
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil
influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a
proud and respected vocation.

Called abjurers, members of this school are sought
when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and
when portaIs to other planes of existence must be closed.

ILLUSORY REALITY
By 14th levei, you have learned the secret ofweaving
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-
reality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st levei or
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical
object that is part of the illusion and make that object
real. Vou can do this on your turn as a bonus action
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for

bridge over a chasm and then make it reallong enough
for your allies to cross.

The object can't deal damage or otherwise

directly harm anyone.

SCHOOL OF NECROMANCY

The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that

spellbook if it is not there already, When you cast
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse
or pile of bones, creating another zombie or ske1eton,

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy

the forces that animate them that you have become

undead under your control, even those created by other
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that

HARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN

their own stories,
and
capabilities beyond those that c1ass and race
define. This chapter expounds on the details
from one another,
that distinguish characters

the rules of backgrounds
and languages, and the finer
points of personality and alignment.

learn about you. !t's worth thinking about how these
characteristics

SEX
Vou can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
your character does or does not conform to the broader

behavior. For example, a male drow c1eric defies the

Vou don't need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's
image. Vou could also play a female character who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's
orientation is for you to decide.

HEIGHT AND WEIGHT

Vou can decide your character's height and weight,
using the information provided in your race description
or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about
what your character's
ability scores might say about his
or her height and weight. A weak but agile character
might be thin. A strong and tough character might be
tall or just heavy.

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your

character's height and weight using the Random Height
and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height
Modifier column determines
extra
height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same
number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in
the Weight Modifier column determines
the character's
extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

""TIKA ANO ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT

•••

Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted
and striving to help others where she cano Artemis is lawful
life but at least
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient
professional

in his approach to murder.

As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He
began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes
when he must-and when it's in his own best interests. In
most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups
alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives.
Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.

IDEALS
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideais
are the things that you believe in most strongly,
fundamental moral and ethical principies that compel you
to act as you do. Ideais encompass everything from your
life goals to your core belief system.

suggested ideais. Five of them are linked to aspects of
alignment:
law, chaos, good, evit, and neutrality. The last
one has more to do with the particular background than
with moral or ethical perspectives.

connections

BONDS
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a
character's
to people, places, and events in
the world. They tie you to things from your background.
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead
you to act against your own best interests
if they are
threatened. They can work very much like ideaIs,
driving a character's motivations and goals.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do
you care most about? To what place do you feeI a special
connection? What is your most treasured possession?

Your bonds might be tied to your c1ass, your

background, your race, or some other aspect of your
character's history or personality. Vou might also gain
new bonds over the course of your adventures.

flaw represents

some vice, compulsion,
particular, anything that someone

FLAWS
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your
character's
or weakness-in
e1se could exploit to bring you to ruin ar cause you to
act against your best interests. More significant
than
nega tive personality traits, a flaw might answer any
of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one
person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What
are your vices?

Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to

GAINING INSPIRATION

Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety
of reasons. TypicalIy, DMs award it when you play
out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks
presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your
character
how you can earn inspiration in the game.

USING INSPIRATION

lf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make
an attack rolI, saving throw, or ability check. Spending
your inspiration gives you advantage on that rol!.

AdditionalIy, if you have inspiration, you can reward

another player for good roleplaying, e1ever thinking,
or simply doing something exciting in the game.
When another player characler does somelhing that

BACKGROUNDS
Every story has a beginning. Your character's
background reveals where you carne from, how you
beca me an adventurer, and your place in the world.
Your tighter might have been a courageous knight or a
grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or
an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild
thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important

story cues about your character's
identity. The most
important question to ask about your background is
what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background describes and start adventuring? Where
did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or,
if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you
have more money? How did you learn the skills of your
e1ass? What sets you apart from ordinary people who
share your background?

SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL

FEATURE:
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
share your faith, and you can perform the religious
ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
companions can expect
to receive free healing and
care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence
of your faith, though you must provide any material
components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a
modest

lifestyle.

Vou might also have ties to a specific tem pIe dedicated

to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a
residence there, This could be the temple where you
used to serve,
if you remain on good terms with it, or a
temple where you have found a new home, While near
your temple. you can call upon the priests for assistance.
provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and
you remain in good standing with your temple.

GUILD ARTISAN

Vou are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in
a particular
field and c10sely associated with other
artisans. Vou are a well-established
mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the
constraints of a feudal social order. Vou learned your
skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the
sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master

GUILD BUSINESS
Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to
support several artisans practicing the same trade.
However, your guild might instead be a loose network
of artisans who each work in a different village within
a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the
nature of your guild. Vou can select your guild business
from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

to creale finished items from raw materiaIs (reflected in
your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's
as well as the principies of trade and good business
practices. The question now is whether you abandon
your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to

tools),

FEATURE: GUILD MEMBERSHIP
As an established and respected member of a guild, you
can rely on certain benefits that membership provides.
Your fellow guild members will provide you with
lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral
if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a
central place to meet other members of your profession,
which can be a good place to meet potential patrons,
allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If
you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you
if a good case can be made for your innocence or the
crime isjustifiable. Vou can also gain access to powerful
political figures through the guild, if you are a member
in good standing. Such connections might require the
donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
Vou must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If

you miss payments, you must make up back dues to
remain in the guild's good graces.

SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in
they set down their tools and take up
the world-until
an adventuring career. They understand the value of
hard work and the importance of community, but they're
vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

connected to an entire family, and whatever
title you
hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you
should also work with the DM to describe your family
and their influence on you.

Is your family old and established, or was your title
only recently bestowed? How much influence do they
wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation

does your family have among the other aristocrats of the
region? How do the common people regard them?

What's your position in the family? Are you the hei r

Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you

comforts of town and technology. You've witnessed the
migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather
more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend,

COINAGE

Common coins come in several differenl denominalions
based on lhe relalive worlh of the melai fram which lhey
are made. The lhree mosl common coins are lhe gold
piece (gp), lhe silver piece (sp), and lhe copper piece (cp).

Wilh one gold piece, a character can buy a belt
pouch, 50 feel of good rape, or a goat. A skilled (bUl
nol exceplional) arlisan can earn one gold piece a day.
The gold piece is lhe slandard unil of measure for

When merchanls discuss deals lhal involve goods or
services worlh hundreds or thousands of gold pieces,
lhe lransaclions
don'l usually involve lhe exchange of
individual coins. Ralher,
lhe gold piece is a standard
measure of value, and lhe aclual exchange is in gold
bars,

letters of credil, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is worlh len silver pieces,

the mosl

prevalenl coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a
laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's
rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worlh len copper pieces, which are

common among laborers and beggars. A single copper
piece buys a candle, a lorch, or a piece of chalk.

I EQUIPMENT

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property

to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage
when used in this way.

Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. Vou
must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack

rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and
bulk make it toa large for a Small creature to use
effectively.

Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle,
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this

weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can
normally make.

Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged

numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,
and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range.
When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have
disadvantage on the attack rol I. Vou can't attack a target
beyond the weapon's long range.

Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when

you attack with it.

Special. A weapon with the special property has

rules governing its use, explained in the

unusual
weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in
this section).

Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you
can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability
modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you
would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For
example,
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your
Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the

SILVERED WEAPONS
that have immunity or resistance
Some monsters
to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver
weapons, so caulious adventurers
invest extra coin to
plate their weapons with silver. Vou can silver a single
weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This
cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the
time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon
without making it less effective.

SPECIAL WEAPONS
Weapons with special rules are described here.

Lance. Vou have disadvantage when you use a lance

to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance
requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is

Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within
its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it,
ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction

takes 2d6 acid damage.

allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability
check you make using that tool. Too! use is not tied to
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents
broader knowledge of its use. For example,

detail with your woodcarver's
tools, or a Strength check

SERVICES

Advenlurers can pay nonplayer characters
them
or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others
are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with
specialized adventuring skills.

to assist

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on

table. Other common hirelings include

the Services
any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical
town or city, when the adventurers pay them to
perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might

paya carpenter

secret
chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmilh to
forge a special sword. A bard mighl pay a tailor lo make
exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance
front of the duke.

in

Olher hirelings provide more expert or dangerous

services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the
advenlurers
take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as
are sages hired to research ancient or esoleric lore. If a
high-Ievel adventurer establishes
a stronghold of some
kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and
agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward
to meniallaborers
lo keep the stables clean. These
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract
a place to live within lhe stronghold as part of the
offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired lo perform a
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on.

include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.

CLASS FEATURES

When you gain a new leveI in a class, you get its features
for that leveI. A few features, however, have additional
rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra
Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

CHANNEL DIVINITY
Ifyou already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain
a leveI in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the
Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting
the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of
it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class
levei that explicitly grants them to you. For example,
if
you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity
twice between rests beca use you are high enough levei
in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use
the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity
effects available to you from your two classes.

EXTRA ATTACK
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more
than one class,
the features don't add together. Vou
can't make more than two attacks with this feature
unless il says you do (as lhe fighter's version of Extra
Attack does). Similarly,
the warlock's eldritch invocation
Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you
also have Extra Attack.

PART I I CUSTOMIZATlON

OPTIONS

UNARMORED DEFENSE
]f you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you
can't gain it again from another class.

SPELLCASTING
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your
combined leveis in ali your spellcasting classes and
leveis in those classes. Once
partly on your individual
you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one
class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the
Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the
rules as described in that class.

SpeJls Known and Prepared. Vou determine

what spells you know and can prepare for each class
individually, as if you were a single.classed member of
that class. ]f you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example,
you know three Ist.level ranger spells based on your
leveis in the ranger class. As 3rd-Ievel wizard, you know
three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten
wizard spells,
you reached 3rd levei as a wizard) can be 2nd-levei
spells. Ifyour Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six
wizard spells from your spellbook.

two of which (the two you gained when

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one
of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that
class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting
focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the
spells from the class associated with that focus.

SpeJl Slots. Vou determine your available spell slots

by adding together ali your leveIs in the bard, cleric,
druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your leveis
(raunded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and
a third of your fighter or rogue leveis (rounded down)
if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster
feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by
consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster

table.

Ifyou have more than one spellcasting class,

this table

might give you spell slots of a levei that is higher than
the spells you know or can prepare. Vou can use those
slots, but only to cast your lower.level spells. If a lower-
levei spell that you cast, like burning bands, has an
enhanced effect when cast using a higher.level slot, you
can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have
any spells of that higher leveI.

For example,

if you are the aforementioned

ranger 4/

wizard 3, you count as a 5th-levei character when
determining your spell slots: you have four Ist.level
slots, three 2nd.level slots, and two 3rd.level slots.
However, you don't know any 3rd.level spells, nor do you
know any 2nd-levei ranger spells. Vou can use the spell
slots of those leveis to cast the spells you do know-and
potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magie. If you have both the Spellcasting class
feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock
class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact
Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepareu
from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you
can use the spell slots you gain fram the Spellcasting
class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION
of every creature's physical and mental
characteristics:

Strength, measuring physical power

. Dexterity, measuring agility
• Constitution, measuring endurance

To determine an ability modifier without consulting
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then
divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack
roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers
come up in play more often than their associated scores .

Intelligence, measuring reasoning
and memory
Wisdom, measuring perception and insight
Charisma, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant
and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores
creature's assets as well
define these qualities-a
as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the

ability check,

the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six
ability scores. The book's introduction describes
the
basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability
modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks
and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities
that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls

in chapter 9.

have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check,
a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens,
you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
if
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example,
you have disadvantage
and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the
5. ]f you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
you use the 17.

advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll

If circumstances

and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multi pie
circumstances
and only one grants
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have
neither advantage nor disadvantage.

impose disadvantage

When you have advantage or disadvantage and
something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky
trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one
of the dice. Vou choose which one. For example,
if a
halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls
a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to
reroll the I.

Vou usually gain advantage or disadvantage

through

the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration
(see chapter 4) can also give a characler advantage on
ideais,
checks related to the character's personality,
or bonds. The DM can also decide that circumstances
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant
advantage or impose disadvantage

as a result.

PROFICIENCY BONUS
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by
levei, as detailed in chapter
I. Monsters also have this
bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The
bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving
throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die

roll or other number more than once. For example,
two different rules say you can add your proficiency
bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless

By the same token, if a feature ar effect allows you

LIFTING AND CARRYING
Vour Strength score determines
you can bear. The following terms define what you can
lift or carry.

terrain they're moving over.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN
The traveI speeds given in the Travei Pace table
assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains,
or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face
dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep
mountains, and ice-covered ground-all
difficult terrain.

an hour, or a day.

SPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness
areas often involves more than simply walking.
Adventurers might have to climb, crawl. swim, or jump
to get where they need to go.

SWIMMING. AND CRAWUNG

CUMBING,
While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain). unless
a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the
DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or
one with few handholds requires a successful Strength
(Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in
rough water might require a successful Strength
(Athletics) check.

jUMPING
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

LongJump. When you make a 10ngjump. you cover a
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at
leasl 10 feet 011fool immedialely before the jump. When
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
that distance. Eilher way, each fool you clear on the
jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the heighl of your jump
doesn't maller. such as a jump across a stream or
chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a

PART 2 I ADVENTURINO

DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle
(no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as
a hedge or low wall. Otherwise. you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain. you must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your
feet. Otherwise. you land prone.

HighJump. When you make a high jump. you leap
into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength
modifier ifyou move at least 10 feet on foot immediately
before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,
you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each
foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In
some circumstances. your DM might allow you to make
a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you
normally cano

Vou can extend your arms half your height above
yourself during the jump. Thus. you can reach above
you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1Vi
times your height.

ACTIVITY WHILE TRAVELING

As adventurers travei through a dungeon or the
wilderness,
some characters might perform other tasks to help
the group's journey.

they need to remain alert for danger, and

MARCHING ORDER
The adventurers should establish a marching order.
A marching order makes it easier to determine which
characters are affected by traps. which ones can spot
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those
enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank. one or more
middle ranks. or the back rank. Characters in the front
and back ranks need enough room to travei side by
side with others in their rank. When space is toa tight,
the marching order must change, usually by moving
characters to a middle rank.
Fewer Than Three Ranks.

If an adventuring party
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they
are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank,
it's considered a front rank.

STEALTH
While traveling at a slow pace. the characters can move
stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.
See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

NOTICING THREATS
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the
characters to determine whether anyone in the group
notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular
rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a
maze of tunnels. the DM might decide that only those
characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or
spot a stealthy creature following the group, while
characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.

While traveling at a fast pace. characters take a -5
penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
to notice hidden threats.

FOOD AND WATER

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of
exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack
of food or water can't be removed until the character
eats and drinks the full required amount.

FOOD
A character needs one pound of food per day and can
make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day
without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum
I). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character
automatically suffers one levei of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days

without food to zero.

SOCIAL INTERACTION
Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying
monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less
important,
adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.
Interaction takes on many forms. Vou might need

the roles of any
characters who are participating in the interaction that

is called a nonplayer

(NPC).

In general

terms, an NPC's altitude toward you is
described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly
NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are
inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you
want from a friendly NPC, of course.

Social

interactions have two primary aspects:

roleplaying and ability checks.

ROLEPLAYING

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.

approach. Most players use a combination of the two
styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for YOU.

DESCRIPTIVE ApPROACH TO ROLEPLAYING
With this approach, you describe your character's words
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on

what your character does and how he or she does it.
For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek

Cloakwood for his family's misfortune. At a tavern. an
obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek's table and tries to
strike up a conversation with the dwarf.

Chris says, "Tordek spits on the fioor, growls an
insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits
on a stool and glares at the minstrei before ordering
another drink."

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood

and given the DM a clear idca of his character's
altitude and actions.

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your

though you still need to describe things

Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek
above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used
active roleplaying:

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,
"I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here.
If I wanted to hear anything out of you, l'd snap your
arm and enjoy your screams."
In his normal voice, Chris
then adds, "I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar."

proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts
to convince or deceive will fali short.

ABILITY CHECKS

In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in
determining the outcome of an interaction.

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's altitude,

but there might still be an element of chance in the
situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma
check at any point during an interaction if he or she
wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's
reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain
situations, at your DM's discretion.

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking

of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack

BETWEEN AnVENTURES
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting
arms and armor, performing research, or spending
their hard-earned gold.

the DM might want to keep
track of just how much time is passing as events beyond
your perception stay in motion.

LIFESTYLE EXPENSES

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality
of !ife and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as
described in chapter 5.
Living a particular

lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect

on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way
to you. For example,

lifestyle, it might be easier
for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you

DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES

the DM might ask you what your

Between adventures,
character
of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime
activity requires a certain number of days to complete
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day
to count. The days do not need to be consecutive.
Ir you
have more than the minimum amount of days to spend,
you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period
of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

CRAFTING
Vou can craft nonmagical objects,
equipment and works of art. Vou must be proficient
with tools related to the object you are trying to create
(typically artisan's
tools). Vou might also need aeeess to
special materiais or locations necessary to create it. For
example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a
forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you
can craft one or more items with a total market value
not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materiaIs
worth half the total market value. Ir something you
want to craft has a market value greater
than 5 gp, you
make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you
reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit
of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days
to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters

can combine their efforts toward

the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters
ali have proficiency with the requisite tools and are
working together
in the same place. Each character
contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent
helping to craft the item. For example,

BONUS ACTIONS
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus
action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows
a rogue to take a bonus action. Vou can take a bonus
action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something as a bonus
action. Vou otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.
Vou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so
you must choose which bonus action to use when you
have more than one available.

Vou choose when to take a bonus action during your

also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need

objects always require an action to use, as stated
in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any
of these activities when it needs special care ar when it
presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,
could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck doar ar turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

BREAKING Dp YOUR MOVE
Vou can break up your movement on your turn, using
some of your speed before and after your action. For
example,
if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feel.

MOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS
If you take an action that includes more than one
weapon attack, you can break up your movement even
further by moving between those attacks. For example,
a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra
Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could
move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then
attack again.

USING DIFFERENT SPEEDS
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking
speed and a f1yingspeed, you can switch back and forth
between your speeds during your move. Whenever you
switch, subtract
the distance you've already moved fram
the new speed. The result determines how much farther

Spellcasters
many monsters, have access to spells and can use
them to great effect in combal. Each spell has a casting
time, which specilies whether
the caster must use an
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the
spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an
action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action,

to cast such a spell. See chapter 10 for the rules
on spellcasting.

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for

USE AN OBJECT

Vou normally interact with an object while doing
something else, such as when you draw a sword as part
of an attack. When an object requires your action for
its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action
is also useful when you want to interact with more than
one object on your turno

MAKING AN ATTACK
Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a
weapon aI range, or making an attack roll as part of a
spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack's

range: a creature, an object, ar a location.

2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether
the target has cover and whether you have advantage
ar disadvantage against the target. In addition, spel1s,
special abilities. and other effects can apply penalties
ar bonuses to your attack rol1.

3. Resolve the attack. Vou make the attack roll. On a

hit, you rol1damage, unless the particular attack has
rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause
special effects in addition to ar instead of damage.

If there's ever any question whether something you're

doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're
making an attack rol1,you're making an attack.

ATTACK ROLLS

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines
whether the attack hits ar misses. To make an attack
rol1,rol1a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. lf the
total of the roll plus modifiers equals ar exceeds the
target's Armar Class (AC),the attack hits. The AC of a
character is determined at character creation. whereas
the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

MODIFIERS TO THE ROLL
When a character makes an attack rol1,the two most
common modifiers to the rol1are an ability modifier
and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster
makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is
provided in its stat block.

Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee
weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used
for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that
have the finesse ar thrown property break this rule.
Some spel1s also require an attack roll. The ability

modifier used for a spel1 attack depends on the
spellcasting ability of the spel1caster, as explained
in chapter 10.

Proficiency Bonus. Vou add your proficiency bonus
to your attack rol1when you attack using a weapon with
which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack
with a spell.

ROLLING I OR 20
Sometimes fate blesses ar curses a combatant, causing
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 rol1for an attack is a 20, the attack hits

regardless of any modifiers ar the target's AC. In
addition, the attack is a criticai hit, as explained later
in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a I, the attack misses

regardless of any modifiers ar the target's AC.

UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice
by hiding, casting the invisibility spel1, ar lurking
in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have

disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether
you're guessing the target's location ar you're targeting
a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in

the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but
the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not
whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on

attack rolls against

il.

lf you are hidden-both

unseen and unheard-when

you make an attack, you give away your location when
the attack hits or misses.

RANGED ATTACKS

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a
crossbow, huri a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles
to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot
spines from its taii. Many spells also involve making a
ranged atlack.

RANGE
Vou can make ranged attacks only against
a specified range.

targets within

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a

single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller
number
is
the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when

RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged atlack with
a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have
disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet
of a hostil e creature who can see you and who isn't
incapacitated.

MELEE ATTACKS

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a meIee atlack allows
you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack
typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword,
a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a
melee attack when it strikes with its daws, horns,
tentades, or other body parI. A few spells also involve
making a mele e atlack.

teeth,

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus
attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a
melee attack. Certain creatures
(typically those larger
than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach
than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

When you are unarmed,

you can fight in melee by
making an unarmed strike, as shown in the weapon
table in chapter 5.

OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies
to drop their guardo Vou can rarely move heedlessly past
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so
provokes an opportunity attack.

Vou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile
creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To
make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction
to make one melee atlack against

Vou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by
taking the Disengage action. Vou also don't provoke an
opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone
or something moves you without using your movement,
action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an
opportunity atlack if an explosion huris you out of a foe's
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light
melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can
use a bonus action to atlack with a different

GRAPPLING
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it,
you can use the Attack action to make a special melee
attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks
with the Atlack action, this atlack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no more than one

size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target
by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics)
check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject
to
the target
the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the
target whenever you like (no action required).

Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by
your Strength (Athletics) check.

Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more

with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those
with fewer hit points are more fragile.

points) can be any number

as a creature takes damage ar receives healing.

or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,
this one
isn't tied to any ability score. Vou are in the hands of fate

HEALING

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even
death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can
restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter
8), and magical methods such as a cure wOllnds spell or
a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.
When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit
points regained are added to its current hit points. A
creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum,
so any hit points regained in excess of this number are
lost. For example, a druid granls a ranger 8 hit points of
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a
hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points
from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can't regain hit points until
magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.

DROPPING TO O HIT POINTS
When you drop to O hit points, you either die outright or
fali unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

INSTANT DEATH
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage
reduces you to O hit points and there is damage
remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals
or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of
12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she
takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced
to O hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because
the remaining damage equals her hit point
maximum,

the cleric dies.

TEMPORARY HIT POINTS

Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit

When you have temporary hit points and take damage,

the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For

CHAPTER 10: SPELLCASTING

in the form of a spell.

AGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND
most often appears
This chapter provides the rules for
casting spells. Different character
classes have distinctive ways of learning
and preparing their spells, and monsters

use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source,
a spell follows the rules here.

WHAT 1s A SPELL?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping
of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse
into a specific, limited expression.
a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of
raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a
particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way,
and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in
most cases, ali in the span of seconds.

In casting a spell,

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective

wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or
remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy
away, and restore life to the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created

over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of
them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in
crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be
reinvented by a character who has amassed enough
power and wisdom to do sO.

SPELL LEVEL

indicator of how powerful

Every spell has a levei from O to 9. A spell's levei is a
general
it is. with the lowly
(but still impressive) magic missile at 1st levei and
the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips-simple
can cast almost by rote-
powerful spells that characters
are levei O. The higher a spell's levei, the higher levei a
spellcaster must be to use that spell.

but

Spelllevel and character

levei don't correspond

directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th
levei, not 9th levei, to cast a 9th-leveI spell.

KNOWN AND PREPARED SPELLS

Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must
have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access
to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes,
including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of
spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The
same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other
spellcasters,
such as clerics and wizards, undergo a
process of preparing spells. This process varies for
different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case,

the number of spells a caster can

have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the
character's

leveI.

SPELL SLOTS

Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or
prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of
spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic
and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-Ievel spells
are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's
description (except that of the warlock) includes a table
showing how many spell slots of each spelllevel a
leveI. For example,
character can use at each character
the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-levei spell slots
and two 2nd-levei slots.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends
a slot of that spell's levei or higher, effectively "filling"
a slot with the spell. Vou can think of a spell slot as a
groove of a certain size-small
for a 1st-levei slot,larger
for a spell of higher leveI. A 1st-levei spell fits into a slot
of any size, but a 9th-levei spell fits only in a 9th-levei
si01. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-levei
spell, she spends one of her four 1st-levei slots and has
three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots

(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).

Some characters

and monsters have special abilities
that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For
example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four
Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can ali
cast spells in such a way.

CASTlNG A SPELL AT A HIGHER LEVEL
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a
higher levei than the spell, the spell assumes
the higher
levei for that casting. For instance,
if Umara casts magic
missile using one of her 2nd-levei slots, that magic
missile is 2nd leveI. Effectively, the spell expands to fill
the slot it is put into.

Some spells, sue h as magic missile and cure wounds,
have more powerful effects when cast at a higher levei,
as detailed in a spell's description.

CANTRIPS

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without
using a spell slot and without being prepared in
advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the
caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic
needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's

It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the
ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher leveI.
To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells
known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies
otherwise, as the wizard's does.

CASTING A SPELL
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules
are followed, regardless of the character's class or the
spell's effects.

Each spell description in chapter li begins with a block

of information, including the spell's name, levei,school
of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration.
The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.

CASTING TIME

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more
time to cast.

BONUS ACTION
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. Vou
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action
this turno Vou can't cast another spell during the same
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of I action.

REACTIONS
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells
take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast
in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a
reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when
you can do sO.

LONGE R CASTING TIMES
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituais) require
more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you
cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single
action or reaction, you must spend your action each
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your
concentration while you do so (see "Concentration"
below). ]f your concentration is broken, the spell fails,
but you don't expend a spell slot. ]f you want to try
casting the spell again, you must start over.

RANGE

The target of a spell must be within the spell's range.
For a spelllike magic missile,
the target is a creature.
the target is the point in space
For a spelllike firebaJl,
where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some

spells can target only a creature (including you) that you
touch. Other spells. such as the shield spell, affect only
you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate

from you also have a range of self, indicating that the
origin point af the spell's effect must be yau (see "Areas
af Effect" later in the this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its
range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.

COMPONENTS

A spell's components are the physical requirements you
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S),
or material (M) components. Ifyou can't provide one
or more of a spell's components, you are unable to
cast the spell.

VERBAL (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The
words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power;
rather, the particular combination of sounds, with
specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic
in molion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area
of silence, such as one created by the siJence spell, can't
cast a spell with a verbal component.

SOMATIC (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful
gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell
requires a somalic component, the caster must have free
use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

MATERIAL (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects,
specified in parentheses in the component entry.
A character can use a component pouch or a
speIlcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of
the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is
indicated for a component, a character must have that
specific component before he or she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is

consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this
component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these
components, but it can be the same hand that he or she
uses to perform somatic components.

DURATION

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists.
A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,
or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.

INSTANTANEOUS
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms,
heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way
that can't be dispelled, beca use its magic exists only
for an instant.

CONCENTRATION
Some spells require you to maintain concentration
in order to keep their magic active. If you lose
concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentralion,
that fact appears in its Duration entry, and lhe spell
specifics how long you can concentrate on it. Vou can
end concentration at any time (no action required).

THE SCHOOLS OF MAGIC

••

Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called
schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these
categories to ali spells, believing that ali magic functions in
essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous
study ar is bestowed by a deity.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
rules oftheir own, although some rules refer to the schools.
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers,

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't

interfere with concentration. The following factors can
break concentration:

speIl that requires concentration.
Casting another
Vou lose concentration on a spell if you cast another
spell that requires concentration. Vou can't concen-
trate on two spells at once.
Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while
you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra-
tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,
whichever number is higher.lfyou take damage from
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each
source of damage.
Being incapacilated or kilIed. Vou lose concentration

The DM might also decide that certain environmental

phenomena,
such as a wave crashing over you while
you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell.

TARGETS

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets
to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description
tells you whether
a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature

the spell targets creatures, objects, or

might not know it was targeted by a spell at alI. An effect
like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle
effect, such as an attempt

typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.

A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET
To target something, you must have a clear path to it,
so it can't be behind total cover.

lf you place an area of effect at a point that you can't
see and an obstruction.
such as a wall, is between you
and that point, the point of origin comes into being on

pasition its point of origino Typically,
a point of origin is a point in space, but
some spells have an area whose origin is a
creature or an object.

lines fram the point
of origino If no unblocked straight
line extends from the
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of

lHE WEAVE OF MAGIC

••

lhe worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
Ali existence is suffused with magical power, and potential
energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living
creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of
creation,
every bit of malter and present
energy throughout

the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating

in every manifestation of

the multiverse.

they

Mortais can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead,
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between
the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. lhe
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and
recagnize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. Sy
any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and
inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't
light a candle
with magic in an area where the Weave has been tom. Sut
surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning
to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an
eye, or even reverse death itself.

Ali magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
of magic access it in a variety of ways. lhe spells of wizards,
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane
magic. lhese spells rely on an understanding-Iearned
or
intuitive-of
the workings of the Weave. lhe caster plucks
directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
magic. lhe spells of derics, druids, paladins, and rangers are
called divine magic. lhese spellcasters' access to the Weave
is mediated by divine power-gods,
nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath.

Duration: Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soulleaves
it and enters the container you used for the spell's
material component. While your soul inhabits the
container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you
were in the container's space. Vou can't move or use
reactions. The only action you can take is to project your
soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning
to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting
to possess a humanoids body.

Vou can attempt to possess any humanoid within

100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a
protection [rom evil and good or magic circIe spell can't
be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's
body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the
container. On a success,
the target resists your efforts
to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again
for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can

perceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can't move or take actions at ali.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to
return from the host body to the container if it is within
100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to
its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the
creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success,
you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.
Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your
soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is
more than 100 feet away from you or ifyour body is
dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. Ir another
creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed,
the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive
and within 100 feet. Otherwise,

that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Vou create three glowing darts of magical force. Each
dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see
within range. A dart deals Id4 + I force damage to its
target. The darts ali strike simultaneously, and you can

Duration: Until dispelled

Vou implant a message within an object in range, a
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met.
Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being
worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
message, which must be 25 words or less, though it
can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally,
determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to
deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth
appears on the object and recites the message in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. Ir the object
you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a
mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical
mouth appears there so that the words appear to come
from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you
can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or
it can remain and repeat its message whenever the
trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the
object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to
speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the
object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

MAJOR IMAGE
3rd-Ievel illusion

Casting Time: I action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of f1eece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Vou create the image of an object, a creature, ar some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a
20.foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you
can see within range and lasts for the duration. lt
seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. Vou
can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
troglodyte's stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you

can use your action to cause the image to move to
any other spot within range. As the image changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
movements appear natural for the image. For example,
if you create an image of a creature and move it, you
can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a
conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
iIlusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an iIlusion with a successfullntelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save De. lf a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image, and its other sensory
qualities become faint to the creature.

a spell slot of 6th leveI or higher, the spelllasts until
dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)

Duration: 24 hours

Vou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures
of your choice that you can see within range and that
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do
some other obviously harmful act automatically negates
the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
Vou can also specify conditions that will trigger a
special activity during the duration. For example, you
might suggest that a group of soldiers give ali their
money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't
met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.
lf you or any of your companions damage a creature

affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
At Higher LeveIs. When you cast this spell using
a 7th.leveI spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When
you use an 8th.level spell slot, the duration is 30 days.

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your

you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's
impossible to track which image is real. Vou can use
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during
the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the
attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

lf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or

higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores ali other damage and effects. The spell ends

Vou craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a
creature that you can see within range. The target must
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you
create a phantasmal object, creature. or other visible
phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a
lO-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead
ar constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature. and other

stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm

with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If the check succeeds,
the target realizes
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats

the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes
any illogical outcomes from interacting with the
phantasm. For example. a target attempting to walk
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls
once it steps anta the bridge. ]f the target survives the
fali, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up
with some other explanation for its fall-it was pushed,
it slipped, ar a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's
reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the
target. Similarly. a phantasm created to appear as tire. a
pool of acid. ar lava can burn the target. Each round on
your turn. the phantasm can deal Id6 psychic damage
to the target if it is in the phantasm's area ar within 5

PROJECT IMAGE
7th-levei iIlusion

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 miles
Components: V,S, M (a small replica of you made from

materiais worth at least 5 gp)

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day

Vou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for
the duration. The copy can appear at any location
within range that you have seen before, regardless of
intervening obstacles. The illusion Iooks and sounds
like you but is intangible. Ir the illusion takes any
damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

Vou can use your action to move this illusion up to

twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and
behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your
mannerisms perfectly.

Vou can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus
action, you can switch from using its senses to using
your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own
surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image, and any noise it makes
sounds hollow to the creature.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of
those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against
the targel. The target also can't be charmed, frightened,
or possessed by them. Ir the target is already charmed,

that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. Ir the
creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the
body, the creature returns to life with I hit poinl.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the
time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first
removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an
undead creature to life.

This spell closes ali mortal wounds, but it doesn't
restore missing body parts. Ir the creature is lacking
body parts or organs integral for its survival-its head,
for instance-the

Duration: 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a lO-foot-diameter
circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that Iink
your location to a permanent
teleportation circle of
your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is
on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering
portal opens within the circle you drew and remains
open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that
enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
that space is occupied.

Many major tempIes, guilds, and other important

sequences during your adventures. Vou can commit
a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it

TENSER'S FLOATING DISK
1st-leveI conjuration (ritual)

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet

Duration: 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
3 feet in dia meter and 1 inch thick, that lIoats 3 feet
above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
that you can see within range. The disk remains for the
duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
falls to the ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of YOU. It
can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs,
slopes and the Iike. but it can't cross an e1evation change
of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move
across a IO-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it
was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically

because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you),
the spell ends.

Vou might be able to achieve something beyond the
scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM
as precisely as possible. The DM has great
ruling what occurs in such an instance;
wish, the greater
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some
unforeseen consequence
as a result of how you worded
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
might propel you forward in time to a period when that
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item
or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until
you finish a long rest, you take IdlO necrotic damage
per leveI of that spel!. This damage can't be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops
to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
more than Iight activity, your remaining recovery time
decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent
chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you
suffer this stress.

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are

pantheons

for use in a 0&0 game, divorced from

times. They include deities tha! are

that serve the needs of the game.

THE CELTlC PANTHEON
It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every
soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling
aI night, to the whispering wind through the pines,
to
the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and
it is in
this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from
the brook and stream,
strength of the oak and lhe beauty of the woodlands and
open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to
the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
in a brook, these gods forced themselves

their might heighlened by lhe

into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by
c1erics. for they are c10sely aligned with the forces of
nature lhat druids revere.

THE GREEK PANTHEON
The gods of Olympus make lhemselves known wilh the
gentle lap of waves against
the shores and lhe crash of
the thunder among the c1oud-enshrouded peaks. The
thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered
hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Everyaspect
of nature echoes with their presence, and they've made
a place for themselves

inside the human hearl, 100.

When discussing anything to do with deities,
the
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their
actual homes are not literally "places" at ali, but
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of
thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one
can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as
a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual
regions
lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.

Even in those perceptible regions, appearances
can be deceptive. Initially. many of the Outer Planes
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the
whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on
these planes can remake them completely, effectively
erasing and rebuilding existence itself to bettcr fulfill
their own needs.

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes
often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to
what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take
a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to
the ninth, in a single day-if
desire il. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a
grueling trek across a single layer.

The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments

between them.

The planes with some element of good in their nature
are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such
as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes
with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends
such as demons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the
Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and
a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's
experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.
When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it
feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels
out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.

OTHER PLANES

Existing somehow between or beyond the known planes
of existence are a variety of other realms.

SIGIL AND THE OUTLANDS
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a
plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness.
Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it
ali in a paradoxical balance-simultaneously
and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain,
with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting,
shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world
of the Material Plane.

concordant

The Outlands is circular, like a great wheel-in fact,
Ihose who envlsion the Ouler Planes as a wheel point
to the Outlands as proof, calling il a microcosm of the

planes. That argument might be circular, however,
for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands
inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.
Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,

are the gate-towns: sixleen settlements, each built
around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each
town shares many of the characteristics of the plane
where its gate leads.

At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the

planar wheel, the Spire shoots impossibly high into the
sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of
Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar metropolis
holds countless portais to other planes and worlds.
Sigil is a trader's city. Goods, merchandise, and
information come to it from across the planes. There
is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in
particular
the operation of particular portais. These portal keys
are highly sought after, and many travelers within the
city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key
to allow them to continue on their way.

in the command words or items required for

DEMIPLANES
Demiplanes are small extradimensional
spaces with
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that
don't se em to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come
into being by a variety of means. Some are created by
spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a
powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally,
as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched olf
from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe
growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered
through a single point where it touches another plane.
Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers
to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required
for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows
of the demiplane.

THE FAR REALM
The Far Realm is beyond the known muItiverse. In fact,
it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own
physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from
the Far Realm leak onto another plane, life and matter
are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy
ordinary geometry and biology.

The entities that abide in the Far Realm are toa alien

for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic
creatures swim through nothingness, preoccupied
with madness. Unspeakable things whisper awful
truths to those who dare listen. For mortais, knowledge
of the Far Realm Is a triumph of mind over the rude
boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.
There are no known portaIs lo the Far Realm, or
at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once
pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the
Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak,
but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and
the portaI's location-even its home world-is
long-
forgotten. Other portaIs might still exist, marked by the
alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material
Plane around them.
