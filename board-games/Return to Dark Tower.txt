Long ago, the sorcerer-king Azkol built a Tower at the  
crossroads of the Four Kingdoms. Behind its ebon walls,  
he practiced dark sorcery in his search for power. 

As Azkol’s madness grew, his apprentice, the sorceress Nimet, 
plotted against him. She stole his wondrous treasures and fled the 
Tower, then recruited heroes from the Four Kingdoms to stop him. 
One hero prevailed. Azkol was defeated, and the Tower lay vacant.

But now a new adversary has taken up residence. It grows in 
power, spreading corruption and calling forth wicked creatures 
from afar. This foe cannot be defeated alone. The heroes of the 
Four Kingdoms must unite and return to the Tower.

Overview 

Return to Dark Tower is a cooperative game where heroes of the  
Four Kingdoms join forces, with the aid of a helpful companion,  
to defeat the adversary in the Tower. You all win or lose together.

Your companion will guide you in your quest to breach the Tower 
and engage the adversary in battle. But beware! The Tower’s 
influence is ever working to corrupt the heroes.

You have six months before the Four Kingdoms fall and the 
adversary’s reign is absolute. Can you repel the gathering darkness?

67Concepts to Know: HEROES

 ADVANTAGES 
There are six types of Advantages, which are linked to the 
six traits found on foes and dungeons. Wild Advantages  
can count as any of these six traits.

You calculate Advantages before you battle foes or explore 
dungeons with the matching trait. You then spend them  
to improve the results of battle cards or dungeon rooms.

Advantages with a black background are automatic and  
do not have a cost  A . Advantages with a grey background 
are conditional and have a cost  B .

 ITEMS 
There are four types of items: potions, gear, treasures, 
and quest items. You gain items by reinforcing, 
defeating foes, exploring dungeons, and completing 
quests. You can only use your items on your own turn.

Each hero can carry a certain number of items: 

Potion

unlimited

Gear

up to one of each

Treasure

up to four

Quest Item

unlimited

If you ever gain 
a duplicate gear 
or fifth treasure, 
lose one.

When you gain a potion, draw the top card of the potion 
deck. When you gain gear, choose one from the gear stacks. 

When you gain a treasure, choose one of the face-up 
treasures from the market. When a treasure leaves the 
market, replace it with the top card of the treasure deck. 

When you gain a quest item, find and take it from the  
quest item deck in the box.

See page 13 for what happens when an item is spent or lost.

 WARRIORS 
Warriors are an important 
resource when battling 
foes, exploring dungeons, 
and completing quests. 
Warrior tokens are 
unlimited, so use a proxy  
if the supply runs out.

 SPIRIT 
Spirit is a resource that allows the 
heroes to move farther, gain virtues, 
remove corruptions, and be more 
effective when reinforcing. Spirit 
tokens are unlimited, so use a proxy 
if the supply runs out.

A

C

D

 COMPANIONS 
Companions are allies who aid 
your efforts. In each game, there 
is a main companion who offers 
beneficial quests. Some quests let 
you recruit other companions  
who will provide their abilities  
to the hero they accompany.

When a quest 
to gain a new 
companion is 
completed, the 
new companion 
joins the hero who completed the 
quest and will accompany the heroes 
for the rest of the game.

B

 VIRTUES 
Virtues are special abilities unique to your hero. 

You start the game with three active virtues and 
three inactive virtues, which you can gain during 
the game. You gain a virtue by spending spirit 
when you reinforce at a citadel.

When you gain a virtue, flip one of your inactive 
virtues face up to its active side C . It goes into 
effect immediately.

 CORRUPTIONS 
Corruptions are penalties that weaken your hero. 
You gain a corruption when…

 → an event, battle card, or dungeon room makes 

you lose resources or items that you do not have

 → the outcome of a failed quest instructs you to

 → a building in your home kingdom is destroyed

When you gain a corruption, draw the top card 
of the corruption deck and place it on your hero 
board D . It goes into effect immediately.

You cannot gain more than one corruption 
per event, battle card, or dungeon room. For 
example, if a battle card makes you lose four 
warriors and one spirit, and you do not have 
enough of either, you only gain one corruption 
(not two).

You can only have up to two corruptions. If you 
would ever gain a third corruption, the players 
lose the game! Press the “game lost” button, 
found on most screens in the app.

It is possible for heroes to remove corruptions. 
Place removed corruptions on the bottom of the 
corruption deck.

89Concepts to Know: 
THE WORLD

 KINGDOMS 
The game board is divided into four kingdoms (north, east, 
south, and west). The kingdoms are separated by rivers. 
Each kingdom has 15 spaces. The terrain type of each space 
is indicated by its color and icon.

Desert

Hills

Mountains

Lake

Forest

Grasslands

The kingdom facing you is your home kingdom. The kingdom  
where your hero figure is currently located is your current kingdom.

In games with fewer than four players, a kingdom that is not 
anyone’s home kingdom is known as a dormant kingdom.

 BUILDINGS 
There are four types of buildings: citadels, 
sanctuaries, villages, and bazaars. In each 
kingdom, there is one building of each type.

While you are on a space with a building, 
you can take the Reinforce action 
(explained on page 20).

When a building is destroyed, the building 
and the three skulls on it are removed from 
the game. The hero whose home kingdom 
the building was in gains a corruption.  
If it was in a dormant kingdom, no one 
gains a corruption. 

 SKULLS 
Skulls represent the growing influence of evil. 
They make foes and events more threatening 
and can destroy buildings.

When skulls emerge from the Tower or are 
added due to events, they must be placed on 
buildings. As seals on the Tower are removed, 
skulls will emerge with greater frequency.

Each building can hold up 
to three skulls. If a fourth 
skull would be placed on 
a building, the building 
is destroyed instead. If 
players ever have to take a 
skull from the supply and 
there are none, the heroes 
lose the game!

Citadel

Sanctuary

Village

Bazaar

Three skulls maximum

Seal

No Seal, 
Glyph

No Seal, 
No Glyph

 GLYPHS 
As the seals on the Tower are removed, glyphs will 
be revealed. Each glyph matches a specific action.

While a revealed glyph is facing your home 
kingdom, you must spend one spirit in order 
to take the matching action. If you do not 
spend the spirit, you cannot take the action.



Banner

Cleanse

Battle

Quest

Reinforce

 FOES 
In each game, you will face four types of foes, 
including the adversary. The app will tell you 
when these foes appear and on which spaces. 
Each foe has a matching card.

 → Level: How many battle cards you draw in the app 
A
when you face them in battle. Each game has a 
level 2, level 3, level 4, and level 5 foe (the adversary). 

B

 → Traits: Which Advantages you can spend 
B
against this foe in battle and what might 
happen when you battle them.

 → Strike Event: What this foe will do about  
C
once a month. Foes strike only if there is  
at least one of that foe on the game board.

 → Status: How threatening this foe’s battle cards 
D
and events are. Foe status will grow more 
lethal if any are on the game board for too 
long. Some rare events will weaken them.

FOE STATUS SCREEN

The foe status screen in the app
shows information about each foe on 
the game board. This includes the number 
of each foe, their status, and their current 
strike event. You also use this screen to 
remove a foe without battling when an  
effect in the game allows you to do so.

1011Sequence of Play

The game is played in a series of months. If the heroes do not 
complete the main goal and then defeat the adversary before 
the end of the sixth month, they lose the game.

 INDIVIDUAL TURNS 
In the first month, the first turn is taken by the start player. 
Then play continues in clockwise order. Each player takes 
exactly one turn in the first month.

In following months, the first turn is taken by the player seated 
to the left of the player who took the final turn in the previous 
month. Play continues in clockwise order. You know the average 
number of turns per month, but not the exact number.

The app will inform you when the month ends.

 MONTHLY QUESTS 
At the start of each month (except the first), the app will  
give two monthly quests. Read them aloud and place the 
matching quest markers in the spaces on the board where  
they can be completed.

 → Companion Quest: Completing this quest provides  
a new companion or quest item to help the heroes. 

 → Adversary Quest: Failing this quest allows the adversary  

to advance their plans, making the world worse for the heroes.

Monthly quests fail if they are not completed by the end of  
the month. Read the outcome aloud and resolve any effect,  
as instructed by the app.

Taking Your Turn

Perform these three steps, in order:

1
1  Start of Turn: You may take your Banner action.

2
2  Middle of Turn: You may move, take a heroic action,  

and take a Reinforce action, in any order.

3
3  End of Turn: You must drop a skull into the Tower.

At the start of your turn, you may take the BANNER ACTION listed on your hero board. 
This action is optional. However, you cannot save your Banner action for later.

difficulty, there are fewer turns per month.

Other game effects that apply “at the start of your turn” happen now.  
You can resolve these effects and your Banner action in any order.

 MAKING TRADES 
Once during your turn, you may trade with 
heroes on your space (as long as all agree). 

You may give and take warriors, spirit,  
items, and companions. 

You may not give or take virtues  
or corruptions.

 SPENDING VS. LOSING 
Spending resources or items is optional and can  
be done at any point during your turn. 

Sometimes, you will spend an item to get its 
effect. Sometimes you will spend an item to gain 
a different effect, such as activating a virtue or 
completing a quest. When you spend an item  
for a different effect, you do not get the effect  
on the item you spent as well. 

Example: If you spend 4 potions to activate 
the Relic Hunter’s Inventive virtue, you do not 
also get the effects of the potions you spent.

Losing resources or items is mandatory. You must 
lose them if possible. If you cannot resolve the 
loss fully, lose as much as you have and then gain 
a single corruption. You cannot gain multiple 
corruptions from a single effect.

Adversary quest

Note: You should discuss your plans 
with your fellow heroes, but the final 
decisions for what to do on your turn 
are yours alone.

12132. Middle of Turn

In the middle of your turn, you may MOVE, take a HEROIC 
ACTION, and take a REINFORCE ACTION. These steps are 
optional, and you can perform them in any order. You can  
even split up your move, stopping to take actions before,  
in the middle of, or after moving. 

 MOVEMENT 

Move a number of spaces up to your 
move value. Your base move value  
is listed on your hero board. 

You may spend one spirit to double your  
move for the turn. You must do this before  
you start moving.

Some virtues or gear can modify your move 
value. Modifiers are applied before doubling.  
If your move value changes (e.g., from gaining 
gear) after you have started to move, it does not 
apply until your next turn. 

Moving to an adjacent space takes one move. Spaces 
on the game board are adjacent to each other if they 
share a segment of narrow gold border (land) or 
thick blue border (river).

Note: When you cross a river, you 
cannot move to a space further up  
or down the river. The river is not  
a space; it is a border.

Nothing on the game board prevents 
or stops movement. You can move 
through foes, skulls, tokens,  
or other heroes.

Example: You (Orphaned Scion) are 
in the Upper Ice Fangs. You can move 
up to three spaces. First, you move 
two spaces to the Inner Kinghills. In 
the Inner Kinghills, you stop to take 
an action. You then use your last 
space of movement to move back to 
the Peaks of the Djinn.

 HEROIC ACTIONS 
There are three different heroic actions: A) CLEANSE, 
 B) BATTLE, and C) QUEST. You may take only one of  
these heroic actions per turn.

Before you take the Battle or Quest action, calculate how 
many Advantages you have available. (See Advantages  
to the right.)

Important: After you complete a heroic action,  
gain two spirit from the supply.

A) CLEANSE

Take the Cleanse action to remove skulls from a 
building on your space. Remove all skulls from 
the building and return them to the supply. 
Unless you have an ability that allows otherwise, 
you cannot Cleanse in a space without skulls.

1

2

Example: You (Orphaned 
Scion) are in the Hissing 
Groves. The citadel has three 
skulls, and you decide to 
cleanse it. You remove all of 
the skulls and return them 
to the supply. 



Your Generous virtue lets you 
also remove one skull from 
another building after you 
take the Cleanse action, so 
you remove one skull from the 
village in the east kingdom. 



At the end of this heroic 
action, you gain 2 

 .

 ADVANTAGES 
You can spend Advantages to 
improve battle cards or dungeon 
rooms. When you begin the battle 
or enter the dungeon, calculate 
how many automatic Advantages 
you have (black background). 
You can spend the cost to gain 
a conditional Advantage (gray 
background) in the middle of a 
battle or dungeon if needed.

If you gain an item in the middle of 
a battle or dungeon, you gain any 
automatic Advantages it gives and 
can use them in the same action. 
If you lose an item in the middle of 
a battle or dungeon that gave you 
an automatic Advantage, you don’t 
lose that Advantage.

You can spend up to 10 Advantages 
in a single heroic action. Spending 
Advantages is different from 
spending items. When you spend 
an Advantage, you do not return 
the item that created it. 

Unspent Advantages are lost when 
the heroic action is over.

Sometimes, you will need to spend 
Advantages to complete a monthly 
quest. In this case, calculate your 
Advantages and then spend them 
all at once to complete the quest.

14152. Middle of Turn (cont.)

B) BATTLE

Take the Battle action to battle a foe on your space 
and remove them from the board. You can only take 
the Battle action while on a space with a foe. If more 
than one foe is on your space, choose one.

STARTING THE BATTLE

Calculate your automatic Advantages. Open the battle screen 
to select a foe. Select a number of battle cards equal to the foe’s 
level. The app will reveal the first selected card. Many cards  
will make you lose warriors. Each foe also has special cards 
based on their traits, as well as a unique critical hit card.

SPENDING ADVANTAGES

You may spend your Advantages to improve the revealed 
battle cards. To spend an Advantage, press the arrow on the 
bottom of the battle card. The card will change to a better 
result, or maybe even a positive effect.

 → You can spend your Advantages as you like, including 
multiple Advantages or no Advantages on a single card.

 → Each card can be improved, with enough Advantages, 
until you have the best possible result for that card. 

 → You cannot undo spent Advantages.

 → The app shows how many you have spent so far per battle. 

APPLYING THE RESULTS

When you are done spending Advantages on a card, follow the 
instructions in the app to resolve the card and see the next 
card. Remember, if you cannot fully resolve the losses from 
a card, resolve what you can and gain a corruption. Once all 
cards have been resolved, that foe is defeated! Remove the foe 
token from the game board.

 BATTLING THE ADVERSARY 
Once you have completed the main goal, you can battle the adversary.  
This works like a normal battle, but with two key exceptions:

 → You may retreat from a battle with the adversary. You must resolve at least one 
battle card. After that, you can choose to retreat or continue to the next card.

 → Advantages applied to the adversary’s battle cards remain for future battles. 

Note: Heroes might need to battle the adversary  
multiple times before striking the final blow.

Press the battle button to open the battle screen

Select a foe to battle

Example: You decide to battle 
brigands. Their status is lethal, 
and you have four Advantages. 
Brigands are a level 2 foe, so you 
must select two battle cards. 

1

 due to skulls on a 

The first card forces you to 
lose 12 
nearby building. You spend three 
Advantages by pressing the 
arrow three times. This improves 
the card until it causes no losses. 
You decide to save your last 
Advantage because you still have 
one more card left.  

The next card forces you to 
lose 10 
. You spend one 
Advantage to improve it so 
you only have to lose 7 
.

2

 REMOVING FOES 
Certain effects let you remove foes from the game board without 
battling them. Open the foe status screen to select which foe to 
remove. This is not a heroic action, so you do not gain two spirit. 
The adversary cannot be removed this way.

16172. Middle of Turn (cont.)

C) QUEST

Take the Quest action to complete a quest (including the main goal) or explore a dungeon 
on your space. You can only take the Quest action if you can legally perform one of these 
two options.

 COMPLETE A QUEST 
Quests will require you to be in a certain location, spend certain resources, defeat a certain foe, 
complete a certain dungeon, and so on. To complete a quest, select the quest in the app, then press 
and hold the button. The app will tell you what happens. Read the outcome aloud, gain any rewards 
indicated, and remove the quest marker from the game board.

1

2

Example: You decide to complete the monthly 
companion quest. This quest requires you to be 
in the Ash Hills and spend two gear.

You move to the Ash Hills and return your Dusky 
Cloaks and Leather Armor to their stacks in order to 
meet the quest’s requirements. You gain Hakan the 
Artificer as a companion. At the end of this heroic 
action, you gain 2 

 .



Spend  gear

 COMPLETING THE MAIN GOAL 
The main goal is a type of quest. You can complete the main goal, just like a normal quest,  
if you meet all of its requirements. Completing the main goal will cause the adversary  
to spawn on the game board. You can now battle it to defeat it and win!

 EXPLORE A DUNGEON 
Dungeons will spawn as part of certain quests. The goal of 
each dungeon is to complete it by exploring rooms until you 
find its target room (e.g., where someone is hiding or where 
an item is hidden). Completing a dungeon automatically 
completes its associated quest. 

ENTERING THE DUNGEON

Press the dungeon button and select a dungeon  
to explore. The app will show the starting room  
and any unexplored room you can enter. Select  
one to enter. When you do, the app will reveal  
what happens in the new room.

SPENDING ADVANTAGES

You can spend one Advantage to improve the results of  
a room. To do so, press the “improve” button. The room  
will then change to a better result.

 → Each room can only be improved once.

 → You cannot undo spent Advantages.

APPLYING THE RESULTS

After deciding whether or not to spend an Advantage, follow 
the instructions in the app to resolve the room. If you cannot 
fully resolve the losses from a room, resolve what you can and 
gain a corruption. That room is now cleared, and you decide 
whether to explore a new room or leave the dungeon.

 → If you clear the target room, you have completed the dungeon!

 → If you leave the dungeon, the rooms you cleared will remain 

cleared the next time any hero explores that dungeon.

Dungeon button

Example: You decide to 
explore a fortress. Fortresses 
have the melee trait. You 
have one Advantage from 
your Longswords.

The first room you enter  
forces you to lose 5 
.  
You have 7 
and not spend your Advantage. 

, so you decide to lose them 

The next room forces you to lose 1 
You don’t have any spirit, so you spend 
your Advantage to improve the result. 
Now you gain 1 

  instead! 

 . 

Since you are out of Advantages, you 
decide to leave, having cleared two rooms 
but not completed the dungeon.

At the end of this heroic action,  
you gain 2 

 .

die roll, drawing the top card of the 
potion deck.

3. End of Turn 

At the end of your turn, you must take a skull from the 
supply and drop it into the Tower. If you cannot drop  
a skull because the supply is empty, the heroes lose! 

1

When you drop a skull, it might emerge from the Tower, 
cause a level to rotate, or cause events to occur. If skulls 
emerge, place them first, then resolve events. 

Note: Once you have dropped a skull into the Tower,  
you may not use items any more on that turn,  
not even to deal with skulls or events.

Example: You (Spymaster) drop a skull in the 
Tower. When you do, a skull emerges into the  
east kingdom, which is the Relic Hunter’s  
home kingdom. 

2

 PLACING SKULLS 
When a skull tumbles out of a Tower opening, 
it must be placed on a building in the kingdom 
where it first emerged (even if it came to a stop  
in a different kingdom).

Each player decides where to place skulls that emerge  
in their home kingdom. The player who dropped the 
skull into the Tower decides where to place skulls 
that emerge in dormant kingdoms.

If a building would receive its fourth skull, it is 
destroyed! Remove the building and the three 
skulls on it from the game. The fourth skull that 
would go on it returns to the supply. The player 
whose home kingdom the destroyed building was  
in gains a corruption. If the destroyed building was  
in a dormant kingdom, no one gains a corruption.



Unfortunately, all of the buildings in the  
east kingdom have three skulls already.  
The Relic Hunter decides to place the skull 
on the sanctuary. Since that would be the 
sanctuary’s fourth skull, it is destroyed. 

The three skulls and the building are 
removed from the game, and the Relic 
Hunter gains a corruption.

3. End of Turn (cont.)

 EVENTS 

Events happen at the end of most  
player turns. The app will alert you.

Read the event aloud and follow its instructions, 
with the player who dropped the skull into the 
Tower making any choices required. Once the 
event is resolved, press “confirm.” Repeat as 
needed for each event.

Events fall broadly into these categories:

 → Foes Strike: Foes will move and/or  
strike out. This event is skipped if 
none of that foe is on the board.

 → Foes Spawn: Foes spawn somewhere 

on the game board.

 → Foes Grow in Power: Foes change status 
to become more lethal. This event is skipped 
if none of that foe is on the board.

 → The Tower Stirs: The Tower rotates 
or a seal on the Tower is removed.

 → The Tower Acts: The adversary 
strikes out from within the Tower.

 → Companion Events: Companions 

reveal various good events.

 → New Wares: Players may replace 

treasures in the market.

Example: You (Relic Hunter) drop a skull into  
the Tower. The first event spawns shadow wolves 
in the Forest of Shades and the Bleak Wastes. 

You place one shadow wolves token on each  
of those spaces. 

The next event tells you to remove the seal 
indicated by the glowing lights.

When an event tells you to remove a seal, remove 
the one indicated by the glowing lights. 

3

If skulls emerge when the Tower rotates or a seal  
is removed, place those skulls as normal.

After you resolve any events, the next player’s  
turn begins. 



When the seal is removed, three skulls emerge 
into the north kingdom, which is the Brutal 
Warlord’s home kingdom. The Brutal Warlord 
decides where to place those skulls on the 
buildings in the north kingdom.

2223Long ago, Azkol’s apprentice, the sorceress Nimet, sought out the  
greatest hero from each kingdom in an attempt to end her master’s evil.  
Travel back to that time and prove yourself worthy. Enter the Tower  
and steal Azkol’s most powerful relic, weakening him forever.

Competitive Game

We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the cooperative  
game mode before you try the competitive game mode.

  OVERVIEW 
In the competitive game mode, the heroes race to be the first  
to find the relic hidden within the Tower dungeon.

 SETUP CHANGES 
Observe these changes and additions to the game setup:

 → Deal each player four heroic test cards 

(one of each type), face down.

 → Give each player one Amulet of Hope quest item.

 → Choose the competitive game mode in the app.

 HERO GOALS 
The goal for each hero is to complete three heroic tests,  
enter the Tower dungeon, and find the relic — all without 
getting eliminated.

COMPLETING HEROIC TESTS

Completing a heroic test requires you to take the Quest action 
while in a specific location on the game board. In addition,  
you must also have or spend certain resources or items.  
Flip the heroic test card face up once it is completed. 

Important! When you complete a heroic test, you may 
remove a seal from any Tower opening or place a removed 
seal back on any Tower opening.

- OR -

++



Optional heroic test completion effect

ENTERING THE TOWER DUNGEON

Once you have completed three heroic tests, you have gained access to the Tower dungeon.  
You can then enter the Tower dungeon by taking the Quest action on any space adjacent  
to the tower.

FINDING THE RELIC

Finding the relic requires you to find the room in the Tower dungeon where the relic is hidden.  
If you find the relic, you win the game! If you leave before you find it, you can re-enter the Tower 
dungeon and keep exploring on a future turn. But another hero might find it before you!

 HERO ELIMINATION 
If you would gain a third corruption or have to place or drop a skull and none are in the supply,  
you are eliminated from the game, and your home kingdom becomes dormant.

 END OF THE GAME 
If one hero finds the relic, that hero wins! If all but one of the heroes are eliminated, 
the lone remaining hero wins. If the sixth month ends, or one event eliminates  
all remaining players at once, Azkol reigns supreme and nobody wins.

 CLARIFICATIONS 

 →

The app will offer a quest each month. The first hero to complete the 
monthly quest gains a companion. If no one completes the monthly  
quest, there is no penalty.

 → You do not need permission from other heroes to affect them with items 
or abilities (e.g., moving them with the Potion of One Thousand Strides).

 → Despite the competitive nature of the game, the word “foe” 

only refers to actual foes, not the other heroes.

 → Heroes may still trade with each other if all 

players trading agree to the trade.

 → When you gain a potion, if there are no potions left in the deck, 

you can take a potion of your choice from another hero.

 Foe Tokens 
Foe tokens show the locations of foes on 
the game board. You must take the Battle 
action to battle them. Each foe token shows 
the level and traits of that foe. Foe tokens 
are removed when you defeat them in 
battle or use an effect to remove them. 

Note: The foe tokens are double sided. The 
two sides differ only in appearance, not in 
function. Use whichever side you prefer.

 Dungeon Tokens  
Dungeon tokens show the 
locations of dungeons on the 
game board. You must take the 
Quest action to explore them. 
Each dungeon token shows the 
trait of that dungeon. Dungeon 
tokens are removed when you 
complete them or when an 
event instructs you to.

 River of Fire Tokens 
River of fire tokens are only used when Ashstrider is 
the adversary. These tokens turn normal rivers into 
rivers of fire. When you move across a river of fire, you 
lose six warriors. These tokens cannot be removed.

 Caravan Tokens 
Caravan tokens are only used 
when Miras the Horselord is 
the main companion. Caravans 
function like moving dungeons 
that can be explored. 

 Siege Tree Tokens 
Siege tree tokens are only 
used when Letha the Dryad 
is the main companion. 
Spaces with siege tree tokens 
count as forests in addition 
to their normal terrain type. You can take 
the Reinforce action on a space with a siege 
tree token to move it one space.

 

Spore Tokens  
Spore tokens are 
only used when 
the Lingering Rot 
is the adversary

When you gain a spore token, 
place it on your hero board. If 
you would ever gain a third spore 
token, return all your spore  
tokens to the supply and gain  
a corruption instead.
