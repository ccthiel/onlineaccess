Date: 1st Midsummer, 1491 DR
	Midsummer Fey Folly
	Stage 1: Into the Whispering Woods (Expanded)
	Part A: Locating the Fey Crossing
	The adventurers must first find the fey crossing that allows entrance into the more mystical parts of the Whispering Woods.
	Skill Check: Survival or Nature DC 15 to find traces of fey magic and locate the crossing. Failure means they wander aimlessly, losing precious time.
	Part B: Elusive Moonlit Butterflies
	Once they find the area, they notice moonlit butterflies that must be captured; they serve as the "keys" to unlock the fey crossing.
	Skill Check: Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) DC 16 to carefully capture a butterfly without harming it. Failure means the butterflies become intangible for a brief period, forcing the adventurers to wait before they can try again.
	Part C: Unlocking the Crossing
	After capturing the butterflies, the adventurers must release them at the precise magical glyphs that appear near the fey crossing.
	Skill Check: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Religion) DC 17 to correctly match the butterflies to their corresponding glyphs. Failure results in a minor magical backlash, causing a loud noise that attracts unwanted woodland creatures (think: territorial owls or perhaps a feisty raccoon).
	Only upon successful completion of all three parts can the adventurers proceed to the next stage, delving deeper into the Whispering Woods to face the challenges that await.
	Now, Stage 1 has more substance, turning the journey to find the fey crossing into a multi-step challenge of its own.
	Stage 2: The Living Maze of Thorns (Expanded)
	Part A: Entering the Maze
	As they reach the living maze, it becomes evident that the vines actively shift and change, making traditional mapping useless.
	Skill Check: Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) DC 17 to spot patterns or markers that could help in navigating through. Failure means the adventurers take a wrong turn and end up at the maze's entrance, forced to start over.
	Part B: Avoiding the Thorns
	The maze isn’t just confusing; it’s also dangerous, with thorny vines that move to snag the unwary.
	Skill Check: Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) DC 16 to move through without getting entangled. Failure results in being trapped by the vines, taking some piercing damage and being restrained until freed.
	Part C: The Guardian of the Maze
	Towards the maze's exit, a Thorn Elemental, a minor guardian spirit, questions the party's intent and demands a tribute for passage.
	Skill Check: Charisma (Persuasion) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 18 to either convince the guardian of their noble intent or understand what sort of tribute it desires (could be a small trinket, a song, or a promise). Failure results in the guardian becoming hostile, requiring combat to proceed.
	Successfully navigating all these challenges allows the party to exit the living maze, now thoroughly tested but hopefully still enthusiastic for what lies ahead in the Whispering Woods. With the maze behind them, they proceed to the next stage and the challenges that await.
	Stage 3: The Talking Animals' Riddles (Expanded)
	Part A: Finding the Clearing
	The adventurers have to locate the clearing where the talking animals congregate. This is trickier than it sounds because the forest tries to lead them astray.
	Skill Check: Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) DC 16 to resist the forest's misleading allure. Failure means they're led into a circle and must try again, wasting time.
	Part B: Earning the Animals' Trust
	Upon reaching the clearing, the animals are suspicious. The adventurers must prove they come in peace.
	Skill Check: Charisma (Animal Handling) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 17 to understand the animals and gain their trust. Failure means they're given a false clue, leading them astray.
	Part C: Answering the Riddles
	The Owl's Riddle:
	Riddle: "I wear a face of stoic guise, and yet no man can see my eyes. I can be cheated, skipped, or won, and always flee when day is done. What am I?"
	Answer: Time.
	Skill Check: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 19.
	Riddle: "I whisper through the trees, and I'm found in every lore, I can open any doors but have not the key you're looking for. In towers tall and dungeons deep, I'm sought by mages for their keep. What am I?"
	Answer: A spell or magic word.
	Skill Check: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 20.
	The Turtle's Riddle:
	Riddle: "I was there when the world took form, I'll be there when it meets its storm. I dance through life and death alike, free, but sometimes caught, in lantern's light. What am I?"
	Answer: Fire.
	Skill Check: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 21.
	Failure at any of these checks means the animals become coy and vague, wasting the adventurers' time as they mock or taunt them.
	Part D: Receiving the Fey Blessing
	Successfully answering the riddles grants the adventurers a temporary blessing from the talking animals, giving them advantage on the first skill check they make in the next stage.
	No Skill Check required. This is the reward for successfully completing the stage.
	So there you have it—a more robust Stage 3 that will challenge not just the adventurers' wits, but their social and navigational skills as well. After this, they should be well-prepared for the fey party that awaits them in Stage 4.
	Stage 4: The Fey Party and the Moonlit Chalice (Battle of the Bands Edition)
	Part A: Finding the Main Stage
	The fey realm is ablaze with smaller stages, but the adventurers need to find the main event where the Moonlit Chalice is the grand prize.
	Skill Check: Wisdom (Perception) or Charisma (Performance) DC 17 to either spot the main stage or win over lesser bands to be directed to the big show. Failure means wandering into another lesser-known act and losing valuable time.
	Part B: Battle of the Bands
	The main event is a Battle of the Bands, where the adventurers have to outplay a fey ensemble.
	Skill Check: Charisma (Performance) or Dexterity (Musical Instrument of choice) DC 18 to best the fey musicians. Failure results in jeers from the crowd, and disadvantage on subsequent social interactions with the fey.
	Part C: The Storytelling Contest
	The band battle was just the opening act; now comes the storytelling contest.
	Skill Check: Charisma (Persuasion) or Intelligence (History) DC 19 to captivate the fey audience with an enthralling tale. Failure means the fey get bored and you lose their attention, making it harder to win the chalice.
	Part D: Locate the Moonlit Chalice
	After the performances, the chalice is hidden amongst various magical illusions and glamours.
	Skill Check: Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) DC 20 to discern the real chalice from the fakes. Failure means they grab a goblet of endless wine instead, forcing them to try again.
	Part E: The Final Deal
	Securing the chalice is one thing, but the head pixie wants a final deal: the chalice in exchange for a price or future favor.
	Skill Check: Charisma (Negotiation) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 21 to either make a fair trade or glean the pixie's true motives. Failure could mean accepting a deal with long-term repercussions.
	Victory in the Battle of the Bands and succeeding in the subsequent challenges grants the adventurers the Moonlit Chalice. Now they have to rush back to Saltmarsh in time to save the Midsummer festival.
	So there you have it—the final stage turned up to 11, complete with guitars, lutes, drums, and maybe a magical kazoo or two. This should make for a grand finale that hits all the right notes!
