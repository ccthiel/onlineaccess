Alistair was born in a small druidic community in the Moonshae Isles. From a young age, he showed a strong connection to nature and the elements. As he grew older, he felt the urge to explore the world beyond his secluded forest home. He traveled across Faerun, learning from various druid circles and even spending some time in elven and human courts. Along the way, he became a scholar, collecting ancient texts and artifacts to expand his knowledge. Eventually, his travels led him to Greenhollow, a peaceful village on the southeastern edge of the High Forest. He felt a strong connection to the land and its people and decided to settle there, becoming the village's resident druid and healer.

Relationship with Pine
Pine and his childhood friend Eamon Highridge often explored the forest near Greenhollow, where they frequently encountered Alistair. Recognizing Pine's potential for druidic magic, Alistair took him under his wing as a mentor. Their relationship deepened when tragedy struck Greenhollow in the form of an orc attack. The village was destroyed, and its people were either killed or enslaved. Alistair and Pine managed to escape and lived as hermits in the ruins of their village. During this time, Alistair taught Pine advanced druidic magic and survival skills.

When Pine Remaka felt ready to embark on his own quest, Alistair gave him his blessing but also warned him of the dangers he would face. Although Alistair has been living alone in the ruins of Greenhollow for the past year, he continues to keep an eye on Pine Remaka, using his druidic abilities to monitor his former pupil's progress and offer guidance when necessary.
