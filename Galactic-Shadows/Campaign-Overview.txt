This is a Star Wars Saga Edition roleplaying game campaign I'm running. It is set during the clone wars, with the battle between the separatists and the republic raging, The campaign is going to be an open ended sanbox type campaign with no set story line or campaign arc to follow. I'm trying to just go with the flow of the characters. 

It's going to use the Great Resynchronization calendar as it's set before the Battle of Yavin. There are 12 months to the year, 4 weeks per month and 7 days per week. The names of the months in order of the first month are:
Banthaar: Named after the Bantha, a creature native to Tatooine.
Corusca: After the Coruscant capital and the Corusca gem.
Alderaa: Inspired by the planet Alderaan.
Hothma: Named after the icy planet Hoth.
Endora: A nod to the forest moon of Endor.
Bespinar: From the gas giant Bespin, known for Cloud City.
Rylotha: Combining Ryloth, the Twi'lek homeworld, with Lothal from 'Star Wars Rebels.'
Yavinar: After Yavin, the location of a major Rebel base.
Mandalorei: Named after the planet Mandalore, home to Mandalorian warriors.
Dathomira: From Dathomir, the planet of Nightsisters and Darth Maul.
Feluciaar: Inspired by the vibrant, jungle planet Felucia.
Kashyyka: Named after Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld.
The campaign began on the 1st of Banthaar, year 13 of the Great Resynchronization.


The PDF file that's also uploaded called 'Tatooine Manhunt Saga.pdf' is a short adventure I plan on using.
