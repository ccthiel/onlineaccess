Campaign Timeline:
Year 13 of the Great Resynchronization
Firstmonth (Banthaar)
Firstday:
The party met in the Mos Eisley Cantina. All began to get to know each other.

At one point Ten'Shin managed to steal the comlink of Greef Teeka and the party determined he is working for someone called Zan and is actively looking for Aldar Tallon. There was much nonsense. Ten'Shin also tried and, initially failed, to steal the speederbike of a trandoshan.

Zil Gik also stole a speeder, but did so quietly by hotwiring it.

They party has decided to head for the Power Station in an attempt to "borrow" some equipment to scan for Aldar Tallon in addition to continuing to listen to Greef Teeka to see if his group has located Aldar Tallon.
GM Notes:
Ten'Shin has pissed off Sskar Vossk - leader of the Desert Fangs by stealing his speeder. This is most likely going to go somewhere as Ten'Shin did it immediately outside the docking bay the group has both ships in and it's not exactly difficult for the Desert Fangs to figure out which ships belongs to Ten'Shin
