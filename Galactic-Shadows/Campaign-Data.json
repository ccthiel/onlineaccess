            "entry": "<p>This is a player character in the star wars saga edition rpg campaign. Below is his backstory as well as physical appearance and other notes.</p><p>Name: Ten'shin</p><p>Species: Jawa</p><p><br></p><p>Space Rodent Without a Cause</p><p><br></p><p>Outward description: Aside from his stature (4’1”), nothing indicates that Ten’shin is actually a Jawa as far as his person goes. Typically he wears a bomber jacket over a Republic Navy Flight Suit that has been noticeably modified to fit his stature and his preference of appearance (added in some orange accents - yes, the same orange as the ship). In addition, his face is hidden behind a black mask accented by his glowing orange eyes. In place of where a mouth usually would go is an X made out of chrome. Atop his head rests an ancient looking leather bomber hat and pilot goggles, again modified to fit his face. When Ten’shin wants to disappear into a crowd, he flips his modified bomber jacket inside out. He modified it to be reversible with the interior collapsing into a Jawa robe with just a few adjustments. He keeps a spare hood in one of the compartments of his utility belt. Ten’shin wears a chest holster across his chest nestling a blaster pistol, while an ion blaster rests backwards on his right hip. His diminutive and delicate-looking feet are bare, and their soles are like soft calf leather and are as durable as a military boot. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Backstory:</p><p><br></p><p>Ten’shin woke as the entire world went sideways. His nostrils were singed by the acrid scent of smoke, blood, burning tech, and scorched fur. The sandcrawler had been knocked onto its side, but he found his footing just as quickly as his nimble fingers found his blaster. The cries of the wounded and dying hung thick in the air like ash after a volcanic eruption.</p><p> Tch’kara, where could she be, he thought to himself. I need to find her. We need to get out of here. </p><p>A cacophony of blasterfire seemed to strangle every decibel of sound for what seemed like an eternity as Ten’shin stumbled onward. The first body he came across was that of his grandmother - whose visage was encased in terror. Her lower torso was stained crimson where she lay pinned between shards of jagged metal that once composed the walls of her living quarters.  He checked her pulse despite her death gaze, and he found no sign of life nor hope in her still veins. He quietly said goodbye and slinked toward a commotion coming from a source of light further down the corridor. He approached slowly and found an astromech droid attempting to tear away its restraining bolt. Ten'shin cooed the droid like a horse whisperer addressing a beast of burden. The droid calmed and fell still. Ten'shin removed the restraining bolt and instructed the droid to follow his every move and to make as little noise as possible. The droid offered a quiet whistle in the affirmative. Ten'shin slowly, carefully navigated the sideways, distorted passageways he had called home the entirety of his life. The flames and black smoke seemed to be spreading in every direction he turned, and they prevented him from seeking out those whose cries would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>With clenched teeth and tears streaming down his face, Ten'shin emerged headfirst through a hole in the outer hull. His lungs filled with smoke infused desert air as he was able to exit the wreckage of the sandcrawler, and he hacked and coughed as he tried to get his bearings. He scanned the darkness of the desert, but there was no sign of the perpetrators. Ten’shin looked skyward and glimpsed the outline of a starship hovering above. They appeared to be surveying the effectiveness of their efforts. He knew that ship. It belonged to a group of pirates the elders had decided to engage in business with not long ago. The last encounter had grown heated, but no one could’ve predicted this. Above the ship’s mounted cannons began to shift about excitedly as they anticipated another volley was soon to follow. </p><p>Ten'shin then did the only thing he could do - he ran. Behind him sounded the whistles and beeps emitted by the panicked astromech droid who gave chase after his new master. He did not get far before the sounds of the blaster cannons began again. The fuel cell storage compartment must've been hit because there was a thunderous explosion and Ten’shin was airborne. He shakily rose to his feet, and they would not fail him as he ran through the night. As the three suns began to rise over Tatooine, his blistered feet found their way to the edge of Mos Eisley. He slithered his way to the threshold of a long condemned building, and collapsed into a heap. The astromech droid settled in beside him and resided over his new master while the Jawa slept fitfully into the night. </p><p>Days became weeks before Ten'shin was able to muster the courage to return to the wreckage that remained of his family’s sandcrawler. The beeps and whistles emitted by his companion offered little respite from his grief. In a single evening, the most important aspect of Ten'shin’s life had been stolen from him. Amongst the wreckage he did not find a single sign of life. His hope turned to grief and anger which metamorphosed into a bitter distrustful soul. His grief consumed him, and he fell quickly into addiction and despair. He never found any sign of Tch’kara, but he accepted her passing as there was no rational path supporting her survival.</p><p>Weeks turned to months and months turned to years. Ten'shin was consumed by his grief. He drank, he drank, he stole anything that wasn’t tied down, and then he’d drink some more. He was alone. He knew deep down that Jawas were never meant to be alone. They were born as many; they lived as many; and they died as many. His survival, when the members of his family lost their lives, was an abomination. He was consumed with grief and anger, and this only furthered the extent of his descent into addiction. </p><p>That is when the dreams began. Each night he saw the faces of his loved ones. He saw their agony - their suffering. Each night they screamed for him to help - to save them. But what could he do? He was nothing. He had nothing. He was nothing, and they had died screaming; they died crying; they died afraid. Ten'shin vowed he would never know fear again. He took a path to the heart of the desert. He did not intend to return. </p><p>He set out before daybreak, and in the darkness of a moonless sky, he walked for hours with that blasted astromech following his every step. By midafternoon, the sun tore at his robes and cooked him from the inside, but he walked on. He traveled over countless dunes until he found himself in a featureless valley. He lay down in the warm sand and accepted his fate. It was only when he lay his head down tat he knocked his skull against something metallic in nature. He rubbed his head in pain before he found his footing and surveyed the land before him. He took notice of rises in the sand - unnatural rises that spoke to something buried beneath its embrace. His naturally curious Jawa brain found a focus for its obsessive nature. There amongst the yellow sands of this endless desert, Ten’shin made out what could only be the cockpit of an ARC-170  starfighter. </p><p>The cockpit itself was still mostly intact. Through the glass, he saw the lifeless, desiccated bodies of the ship’s pilot and forward gunner. Their slumber looked somewhat peaceful, like they died in their sleep. Ten’shin continued to brush away the sand with his tiny hands until he found the shattered remains of an astromech droid. Obvious signs of carbon scoring spoke to a violent end for the droid. Ten’shin lay his hand on a shard of its exterior casing, and he saw flashes of its final journey. Its death had been painless, instantaneous, and the lack of its suffering made Ten’shin smile a little bit. Ten’shin thanked his ancestors for such good fortune, especially since he had been so close to a much different conclusion. With gratitude, he laid to rest the remains of the pilot and two gunners - after removing their valuables of course because they wouldn’t be needing them anymore. He decided he would make a flight suit of his own from what remained of the pilot and gunners’ uniforms. He removed all insignias and ranks associated with the Republic Navy and began to design an insignia of his own, the mask of a Jawa with glowing orange eyes emblazoned on the side of a sandcrawler. </p><p>It took nearly a week, but finally Ten’shin was able to unearth the entirety of the craft. When he finished he stood back and proudly gazed at his discovery. The ship had sustained moderate damage to its fuselage, but nothing that he couldn’t repair with parts he could find at Mos Eisley and the surrounding communities. One of the engines had suffered a direct hit and would have to be completely rebuilt, but the other was in fair condition. It only took him a three week’s labor and some scavenged parts to get that engine running again. Ten’shin didn’t waste an ounce of materials as his addiction was soon overcome by his obsession of rebuilding the starfighter. He no longer drank; he simply didn’t have the time. He decided he would leave Tatooine as soon as possible. There was nothing for him here any longer. </p><p>For more than a year, Ten’shin repeated this pattern: awake, eat, scavenge, shit, and build until the sun went down. In the evening, he would nestle in the ship’s cockpit and look at the stars until he fell asleep. He spoke to no one during this time save for the astromech droid that was always by his side. Somewhere in the midst of reassembling the underbelly of the craft, Ten’shin realized he had found a small measure of joy. At the end of the following growing season, Ten’shin had completed his task. </p><p><span><span>\t</span>The Arc-175 Starfighter was once again space worthy. He had rebuilt more than 35% of the craft from scratch. From nose to tail, everything was now in fine working condition. The engines hummed softly and emitted the softest purple hue. He had rigged the rear guns, so the astromech could cover his tail when necessary and removed the need for a forward gunner by rewiring the controls through the pilot’s console.Perhaps the most comical of his modifications was the booster seat he had to install in the pilot’s cockpit in order to be able to reach all of the controls at the same time. If you asked Ten’shin, the starfighter seemed giddy with anticipation to return to the vacuum of space. </span></p><p><span><span>\t</span>So began the legend of the Jawa that wanted the stars. His last day on the planet was also the day he left behind the traditional robes of the Jawa and began to don a black flightsuit and his own version of a Jawa mask merged with a republic helmet. That afternoon, he felt the warm sands of Tatooine under his for the last time. Tomorrow, with a blaster at his side and a sarcastic word on his lips, Ten’shin will begin to make his mark on the galaxy and never look back. Every Jawa one day would learn of his adventures - as would all the planets belonging to the galactic senate. His name would inspire hope, fear, jealousy, or love depending on one’s allegiances;  however, all would agree to the fact that Ten’shin was an honest, fair, and morally good man… err, space rodent. </span></p><p>           Ten’shin’s luck has been on the upswing lately. After answering a Republic Military Recruitment holo looking for independent contractors located in the outer rim, he has been mixing in Republic contracts to the usual array of gigs. The pay is so-so, and they insist on paying him in Republic credits, but as long as it keeps his belly full and the ship in running condition - that’s all that matters. Ten’shin is pleased with the minimal perks that come with taking the Republic gigs, military license for materials wasn’t too shabby, as per his contract - it was taken out automatically in increments from his earnings from his first few gigs he completed. He remembered getting a holo with an advert from the Republic Armory Association notifying his passing security clearance and completed his final installment for his license which had already been uploaded to his credentials. He had just finished a run of medical supplies to an outer rim colony having trouble with a pirate blockade. </p><p>The fixer he works with, a 1st Lt. Drunars, with the Supply and Requisition folks isn’t so bad. He’s a tall human witha slight build and hawk-like features. The man’s blue eyes barely seem to blink. Ten’shin appreciates that the Lt. tries not to look down at Ten’shin when giving orders, which is a courtesy not most races fail to offer to a Jawa. The man has no sense of humor to speak of, but then it’s hard to express humor with that damn Vox Box. Ten’shin has made several mental notes to improve its memory bank. It seems almost insane that the system can only handle a dozen or so phrases. </p><p>The Lt. did ask where he had salvaged the ARC-170. Heck, he even tried to buy it back. The Republic officer said he’d have to remove all the orange paint (camouflage) and the “weird mural thing” (banging Jawa mural) before he’d start repairs, and though Ten’shin had put hundreds of hours into its modifications - he was open to negotiation. Thankfully, he had kept a detailed log of the repairs and modifications he had made to his ship. Ten’shin began to lay out diagram after diagram mapping out the modifications he had made on the interior of the cockpits, which were now more of a Jawa-sized apartment, connected through a series of tunnels he had constructed himself, than  three individual cockpits. Ten’shin spoke at length about how each of these modifications improved the ship in some way or another whether it be performance or long-term habitation. True, one could return it mostly to its original form with a series of levers and knobs he himself had installed, but the pilot’s station alone would have to be completely rebuilt because Ten’shin had modified it for his delicate digits. The Lt. seemed to lose interest after Ten’shin explained his improvements and the ship’s true cost when labor was factored in. </p><p>Anyway, the Lt. is a fair enough man even if Ten’shin had to have the droid correct him repeatedly - that since he owned his ship and had a crew that Ten’shin was a captain, and R7-Clyde was his first mate. Regardless, the Lt. kept calling him ‘agent.’ Ten’shin just kept tapping the Navy Republic Wings he had modified on his modified jumpsuit while the droid chirped and whistled in explanation. That’s just the rules of the sky, my friend. The Lt. seemed to agree because he walked off shaking his head, which is usually what humans do when they agree with you. Odd creatures. Anyhow, Ten’shin really wants to save up for one of those nice long distance blaster rifles with the scopes. He’s partial to the sneaking around, but it gets a little hairy sometimes. Ten’shin decided after a particularly close call, involving the extraction of a couple of Jedi from a warzone on some frozen planet, that it’s better to do things at a distance sometimes. </p><p>Outside of the mind of Ten’shin and firmly rooted in reality, Ten’shin was recruited by The Republic Special Forces due to his reputation as a burgeoning pilot and scout capable of getting in and out of the most extreme conditions without raising the alarm. Ten’shin’s actual role within the Republic Special Forces is only really a secret to the Jawa himself within the organization to the extent that most of his clients are actually fellow agents. The young jawa is more than proving himself to be a reliable asset. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>GM Notes:</p><p>Obvious potential plotlines with both the pirates and his mate Tch'Kara</p><div><br></div>",

Below is his backstory as well as physical appearance and other notes.</p><p><br></p><p>Name: McCallin </p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Class: Scoundrel (Maybe secretly Jedi?)</p><p>Age: 43</p><p>Height: 5’11’’</p><p>Weight: 191</p><p>Hair: Black</p><p>Eyes: Hazel</p><p><br></p><p>Secret History/Facts: </p><p><br></p><p>McCallin was born Raymus Saval on the colony planet of Avedot. He has no childhood memories except for the vision of a woman, and a little boy that he feels is his mother and younger brother. In his memory, they are terrified. Beyond that, it is just the Jedi. His childhood and adolescence experiences were shared with other children engaged in Jedi training. While he was perficient with the Force - especially when it came to clouding minds - and a lightsaber, he distinguished himself among the other students with his constant questions. Questions about his past, his planet, the galaxy. Anything that he could think of. His questions were often meet with simple responses, indifference, or the command to not dwell on such things; just focus on the present and the Jedi. Saval thought it odd that others did not share his frustration with not knowing or being expected to blindly follow without questioning. Early on, he developed doubt about the dogmatic nature of the Jedi, and the way that they viewed the galaxy. This doubt only grew in time. </p><p><br></p><p>At sixteen, Saval was assigned to a Jedi Knight, Telemus, to go to Avedot on a diplomatic mission. The Avedotian government was dealing with a miner strike and requested mediation from the Jedi. Saval was choosen due to him being native from the planet. Saval reminded everyone that he knew nothing about Avedot, but, as usual, his remark was ignored. He was to be a prop for the Avedotians; nothing more. Telemus and Saval arrived on Avedot to learn that the miners, along with their families, had relocated to the moon of Avedot to avoid confrontation with the Avedotian government. Their had been isolated outbursts of violence between the strikers and the government, but nothing substantial. Regardless, the government declared the strikers as a terrorist organization, justifying the label due to those incidents of violence and that the miners had damaged the economy of the planet. Telemus agreed with the assessment of the government with no investigation on his part. </p><p><br></p><p>The government decided to send a bombing run on the miner’s bases, targeting the leaders of the strike. Saval objected to this course of action but his voice was a lonely one and was ignored. Deciding that he couldn’t stand by and do nothing, so he stole a ship to warn the miners of what was coming. After he alearted the leaders of the upcoming attack, he was confronted by Telemus, who had known Saval’s thoughts and followed with his own ship. A confrontation erupted with Telemus defeating the overmatched Padawan. What course of action Telemus would have taken against Saval is unknown, because after the conclusion of the fight, the bombing raid of the base began. While the miners managed to evacuate a majority of the base occupants, a number of civilians were killed, including children. Telemus was also killed in the first wave of bombs, and Saval believed that Telemus protected Saval with the force instead of himself. Using Telemus’s lightsaber - as Saval’s own was destroyed - he freed himself from the wreckage. </p><p><br></p><p>Saval did not remain long with the miners as the government’s attacked created a large, more militant fraction among the miners. It wouldn’t be long before they became the terrorist organization that the government already claimed them to be, using tactics that targeted civilians. Faking his own death and armed with Telemu’s lightsaber, Saval left his home planet a second time. He changed his name to McCallin, based on a type of brand of liquor that he drank after his survival of the bombing.</p><p><br></p><p>McCallin still practices weekly with the force and lightsaber.</p><p><br></p><p>McCallin disassembles the lightsaber (it is medium) when he is in public, carrying two pieces in his belt and hiding the main part in the middle of his electostaff. If he needs to utilize the lightsaber, he can quickly assemble it. He would only use the lightsaber in the most dire of circumstances. In fact, he has only used it twice in combat in the twenty years since his battle with Telemus. </p><p><br></p><p>McCallin primarily uses the force to persuade or to cloud the minds of others, but only to assist others, such as making a border agent more susceptible to a bribe. </p><p><br></p><p>Basic facts: </p><p><br></p><p>McCallin makes his living (so to speak) helping people, especially those affected by war and conflict. This help takes shape in a variety of ways: he finds those that are missing, assists in relocating refugees to safer areas, smuggle medical supplies and resources to war torn areas (he does not smuggle weapons or things that would assist in war), assists NGOs, and protects the helpless from gangs, pirates, government, and the mob. His assistance ranges anywhere from sneaking through military blockades to helping an abused child.</p><p><br></p><p>McCallin uses a melee weapon (Electrostaff) and a blaster pistol. He can also use explosives.</p><p><br></p><p>McCallin is knowledgable in history, politics, and different cultures. </p><p><br></p><p>He can communicate in the more common languages of the galaxy. </p><p><br></p><p>He will not work for governments or for the Jedi. It would take extraordinary circumstances before he would evn associate himself with government agencies, although his work makes him known among those groups.</p><p><br></p><p>A little bit of an Anarchist. Not that he advocates violence (an common misunderstanding of Anarchy) or even that he is against authority. Just thinks that the bigger a government (like say, an empire) and the bigger the bureaucracy, the less likely it actually serves the interests of the people. </p><p><br></p><p>Tries to avoid Jedi whenever possible.</p><p><br></p><p>McCallin does get paid for his work, but he is not driven for profit and will only take what his clients can offer. He is not above “reacquisiting” credits from criminals. </p><p>McCallin will engage in violence but tries to use it only as a last resort. Unless the circumstances dictates otherwise, he prefers to only stun his opponents. This does not mean he will not kill in self-defense or to save others. He has also killed opponents at his mercy if they are particularly evil. </p><p><br></p><p>Not sure about what type of ship he uses, but he pretty much lives in it. Big enough to transport small groups (8-10 if they all showered). Not a particularly good pilot. Relies more on sneaky.</p><p><br></p><p>Does not have a lot of personal relationships (guy does live on a ship), but had a few serious romances throughout the years. </p><p><br></p><p>Sardonic, cynical, self-derecating, humorous, and more than a little world weary, McCallin still works well with groups. He distrusts groups but believes in the individual.</p><p><br></p><p>GM Notes:</p><p>No love lost for either side in the Clone Wars.</p><p>Definite potential plot lines everywhere given his work experience and those he's worked with.</p><p>Owes Jabba the Hutt a favor. Jabba will be cashing in on that.</p><div><br></div>",

I left my home world Falleen to become a soldier. I no longer had to rely on my face to get what I needed or wanted out of life. I could work and earn my way hidden behind my helmet. Always behind the helmet. My people are fine warriors with their own armies, but tend to stick to our own kind. I wanted more.</p><p>I miss my people, my family, but they did not understand my desire to be more than a female, more than a pretty face. I did not want a noble or diplomatic life. I wanted to fight for my people with my hands and mind, not my voice and appearance. I never felt trusted or taken seriously when engaging with others because they expect me to be bewitching them. Behind a helmet with a blaster, I demand a completely different kind of  presence. </p><p>It was only by chance that the convoy landed on Falleen. Maybe not so much by chance but for a good time. I was able to convince the republic commander of a squad in the Republic Judicial Forces to take me to camp to be trained. I will use my species to get where I need to be. Once on base, at training camp, no one took me seriously. But I showed them: I’m fast, strong, smart, calculated, and bested most of them in the water. </p><p>Where no one but me thought I’d succeed, I made a career. Fifty years later, I’m retired, but I’m not ready to stay home. No one knows what to make of me and the truth is that I prefer to take orders and not have to think for myself. </p><p><br></p><p>I have long served the republic in the Judicial Forces, and my people are more loyal to them, and we have no love for the droid army. However I am not confident in the abilities of the republic senators as they tend to be either too emotionally involved or they are greedy and only look after their own interests. I prefer to look after the needs of those who cannot take care of themselves or to serve a greater purpose and find peace.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>GM Notes:</p><p>Definitely leans to Republic support and no love lost against the Confederate Independent Systems (seperatists).</p><p>Some plot lines here with past soldier experience, perhaps.</p><div><br></div>",

They hit up the charging center on the edge of town, spotting Grond watching them there while pretending to be charging and offline. Eventually they stole the parts they needed to create a mishmash of sensors in an attempt to detect the echo drive being used in the deep desert of Tatooine. They also geared up for an assault on Grond with Ten'Shin borrowing an ion blaster from Sivvi, the leader of the tribe of Jawa living in the center of Mos Eisley. Zil Gik \"borrowed\" an ion grenade from her employer Tanno Vikra. The party was able to attack and disable Grond in two rounds, causing mostly ion damage to the droid. They then gathered the disabled droid up, fled to McCallin's ship Yojimbo. After leaving the tracking beacon from Sskar Vossk's speederbike in the docking bay, they took off and began using the sensor mishmash Zil Gik cobbled together. They were able to pick up a signal in the deep desert, land, and make contact with Aldair Tallon. They had a brief conversation before alarms began sounding in Aldair Tallon's lair. The session ended there.  <span style=\"background-color:rgb(157,223,251);\"></span></p>",
