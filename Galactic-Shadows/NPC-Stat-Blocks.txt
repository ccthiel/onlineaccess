Description: Quist is a fair-skinned human with blonde hair and beard. Streaks of white through his hair are the only indication of his true
age. His right hand has been replaced with a knife blade. Within the folds of his long cape he keeps his hands hidden, waiting to surprise any
enemies with his bladed appendage. He has a wad of SoroSuub Chew in his mouth at all times.
Background: Quist once served the Old Republic, enlisting alongside his friend Adar Tallon. But Quist left the service to follow a more
lucrative career and soon became a pirate to be reckoned with. His ties to Tallon remained strong, however, and he agreed to stage the
commanders' "death." He was captured recently by Imperial agents. In return for his freedom, Quist sold what information he had — the
truth about Tallon's death. He is in Tallon's camp to betray Adar one more time.
Personality: Quist is smooth, friendly, courteous, and crafty. It's all an act to hide his true self — selfish, out for number one.
