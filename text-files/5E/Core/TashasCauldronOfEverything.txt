USING THIS  BOOK 

Tasha's Cauldron of Everything offers a host of new 
options for DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS,  and our journey 
through those options is accompanied by the notes 
of the wizard Tasha. Creator of the spell Tasha's hid­
eous laughter,  Tasha's life is  one  of the most storied 
in the D&D multiverse. Raised by Baba Yaga, the 
Mother of Witches herself, Tasha adventured across 
the world of Greyhawk and became the friend and 
sometimes enemy of other famous adventurers, 
like Mordenkainen. In  time, she ruled as the Witch 
Queen and later changed her name to lggwilv-a 
figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, 
and admired. 

Written for players and Dungeon Masters alike, 
this book offers options to enhance characters and 
campaigns in any D&D world, whether you're adven­
turing in Greyhawk, another official D&D setting, or 
a world of your own creation. 

WHAT You'LL  FIND WITHIN 

Chapter 1  brims with new features and subclasses 
for the classes in the Player's Handbook. and it 
presents  the artificer class, a master of magical 
invention. The chapter also offers feats for groups 
that use them. 

Chapter 2 contains patrons who can become one of 
the driving forces behind your group's adventures. 

Chapter 3 sparkles with new magical options, in­

cluding spells, magical spellbooks, artifacts, and 
magic-infused tattoos-available for both player 
characters and monsters to use. 

Chapter 4  holds various rules that a DM may incor­
porate into a campaign, including rules on side­
kicks who level up with the player characters and 
on supernatural environments. The chapter ends 
with a collection of puzzles ready to be deployed in 
any adventure that the DM would like to spice up 
with some puzzling. 

IT'S ALL OPTIONAL 

Everything in this book is optional. Each group, 
guided by the DM,  decides which of these options, 
if any,  to incorporate into a campaign. You  can use 
some, all, or none of them. We encourage you to 
choose  the  ones that  fit best with your campaign's 
story and with your_ group's style of play. 

Whatever options you choose to use, this book re­
lies on the rules in  the Player's Handbook, Monster 
Manual,  and Dungeon Master's Guide, and it can be 
paired with the options in Xanathar's Guide to Ev­
erything and other D&D books.

UN E A R TH E D  A R CA N A  

M uch o f  t h e  material i n  this book originally appeared 
in  Unea rthed Arcana, a series of o n l i n e  articles we 
publish to explore  rules that m ight officially become 
part of the game. Some U n earthed Arcana offerings 
don't end u p  resonating with fans and are  set aside. 
The Unearthed Arcana material that inspi red the op­
tions i n  the following chapters was well received and, 
thanks to feed back from thousands of D&D fans, has 
been refined i nto the official forms presented here. 

TEN RULES  TO REMEMBER 

1.  THE  DM ADJUDI CATE S  T H E  RULES 
The rules of D&D cover many of the twists and 
turns that come up in play, but the possibilities are 
so vast that the rules can't cover everything. When 
you encounter something that the rules don't cover 
or if you're unsure how to interpret a rule, the DM 
decides how to proceed, aiming for a course that 
brings the most enjoyment to your whole group. 

2.  EXCEPTIONS SUPERSEDE GEN E RAL RULES 
General rules govern each part of the game. For ex­
ample, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon 
attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks 
use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general 
rule is in effect as long as something in the game 
doesn't explicitly say otherwise. 

The game also includes elements-class features, 
spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like­
that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an 
exception and a general rule disagree, the exception 
wins. For example, if a feature says you can make 
melee weapon  attacks using your Charisma, you 
can do so,  even though  that  statement disagrees 
with the general rule. 

3.  ADVANTAGE AND D I SADVANTAGE 
Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or 
disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once,  and if 
you have advantage and disadvantage on the same 
roll, they cancel each other. 

4.  REACTION TI M I N G  
Certain game features let you take a special action, 
called a reaction, in response to an event. Making 
opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are 
two typical uses of reactions.  If you're unsure when 
a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's 
the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, un­
less the description of the reaction explicitly says 
otherwise.  Once you take a reaction. you can't take 
another one until the start of your next turn.

5.  PROF I C IENCY B O N US 
If your proficiency bonus  applies to a roll, you can 
add the bonus only once to the roll ,  even if multiple 
things in the game say your bonus applies. More­
over, if more than one thing tells you to double or 
halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve 
it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, 
divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be 
used only once per roll. 

6.  BONUS ACTION S PELLS 
If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 
1  bonus action, remember that you can't cast any 
other spells before or after it on the same turn, ex­
cept for cantrips with a casting time of 1  action. 

7.  C ONCENTRATION 
As soon as you start casting a spell or using a spe­
cial ability that requires concentration, your concen­
tration on another effect ends instantly. 

8.  TEM PORARY HIT POI NTS 
Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. I f  you have 
temporary hit points and receive more of them, you 
don't add  them  together, unless a game feature says 
you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit 
points to  keep. 

9.  ROUN D  D OW N  
Whenever you divide o r  multiply a number in the 
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, 
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. 

IQ;  H AVE FUN 
You  don't need to know every rule to enjoy D&D, 
and each group has its own style-different ways it 
likes to  tell  stories and  to use  the  rules. Embrace 
what your group enjoys most. In short, follow 
your bliss!

CHARACTER OPTIONS 

HEN  YOU  MAKE  YOUR D&D CHARACTER, 
you have an array of options in the 
Player's Handbook to create the sort of 
adventurer you want. This chapter adds 
to those options, making it possible to realize even 
more character concepts. If you combine these op­
tions with those in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, 
the  possibilities for your characters become vast. 
Here are the options featured in this chapter: 

•  A way to customize your character's origin by 

changing some of your racial traits 
•  Guidance on changing your subclass 
•  The artificer class, a master of magical invention 
•  Class features and subclasses for every class in 

the Player's Handbook 

•  Feats for anyone who uses that optional rule 

C U STOM I Z I N G  YOU R  O RI GI N  

At  1 st level, you choose various aspects of your 
character,  including ability scores, race, class, and 
background. Together these elements help paint a 
picture of your character's origin and give you the 
ability to create many different types of characters. 
Despite that versatility, a typical character race in 
D&D includes little or no choice-a lack that can 
make it difficult to realize  certain character con­
cepts. The following subsections address that lack 
by adding choice to your character's race, allowing 
you to customize your ability scores, languages, 
and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have 
in mind for your character. Character race in the 
game represents your character's fantasy species, 
combined with certain cultural assumptions. The 
following options step outside those assumptions to 
pave  the way for truly unique characters. 

ABILITY  SCORE  INCREASES 

Whatever D&D race you choose for your character, 
you get a trait called Ability Score Increase. This 
increase reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in 
the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For ex­
ample, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases 
by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often excep­
tionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every 
dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to 
reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appro­
priate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's 
unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the 
archetype. 

If you'd like your character to follow their own 
path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase 
trait and assign ability score increases tailored to 
your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability 
score increase you gain in your race or subrace 
and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you 
gain more than one increase, you can't apply those 
increases to the same ability score, and you can't 
increase a score above 20. 

For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of 
your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 
2  and your Wisdom by  1 ,  you could instead increase 
your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1 .  

LANGUAGES 

Your character's race includes languages that your 
character is assumed to know, usually Common 
and the language of your ancestors. For example, a 
halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common 
and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are 
extraordinary, and your character might have grown 
up speaking languages different from the ones in 
your Languages trait. 

To  customize the languages you know, you may 
replace each language in your Languages trait with 
a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celes­
tial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, 
Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin,  Halfling, Infernal, 
Ore, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon. 

Your DM may add or remove languages from that 
list,  depending on what languages are appropriate 
for your campaign. 

PROFICIENCIES 

Some races and subraces grant proficiencies. These 
proficiencies are usually cultural, and your charac­
ter might not have any connection with the culture 
in question or might have pursued different training. 
You can replace each of those proficiencies with a 
different one of your choice, following the restric­
tions on the Proficiency Swaps table.

CUSTOM  L I N E A CE 

I nstead of choosing one of the game's  races  for you r  
character a t  1 st level, you c a n  u s e  t h e  fol lowing traits 
to  represent you r  character's l i neage, givi ng you fu l l  
control over how you r  character's origin shaped them: 
Creature Type. You· are a h umanoid. You  determ ine 
you r  a p pearance a n d  whether you resemble a ny 
of your kin. 

Size. You are Small or Medium (your choice). 
Speed. You r  base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Ability Score Increase. One ability score of you r  choice 

increases by 2. 

Feat. You  gain one feat of you r  choice for which 

you qualify. 

Variable Trait. You  gain one of the following options of 
you r  choice:  (a) d arkvis ion with  a  range of 60 feet or 
(b)  proficiency in  one s ki l l  of you r  choice. 

Languages. You  can s peak, read, and write Com mon 

and one other language that you and you r  D M  agree 
is appropriate for you r  character. 

For example, high  elf adventurers have proficiency 

with longswords, which are martial weapons. Con­
sulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see that 
your high  elf can swap that proficiency for profi­
ciency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf might 
be a musician, who chooses proficiency with a 
musical instrument-a type of tool-instead of with 
longswords. Similarly, elves start with proficiency 
in the Perception skill. Your elf might not have the 
keen senses associated with your kin and could take 
proficiency in a different skill, such as Performance. 
The "Equipment" chapter of the Player's Hand­
book includes weapons and tools suitable for these 
swaps, and your DM might allow additional options. 

PERS ONALITY 

The description of a race might suggest various 
things about the behavior and personality of that 
people's archetypal adventurers. You may ignore 
those suggestions, whether they're about alignment, 
moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Your 
character's personality and behavior are entirely 
yours to determine. 

C HA NGI NG A  S K I LL 

Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up 
not being very useful in the campaign or that no lon­
ger fits your character's story.  In those cases, talk to 
your DM  about replacing that skill proficiency with 
another skill proficiency offered by your class at  1st 
level. A convenient time for such a change is when 
you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score 
Increase feature, representing that your character 
has spent a level or two studying the new skill and 
letting the old one atrophy. 

C HA NGING YOU R  SUB C LA S S  

Each character class involves the choice of a sub­
class at  1st,  2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents 
an area of specialization and offers different class 
features as you level up. With your DM's approval, 
you can change your subclass when you would nor­
mally gain a new subclass feature.  If you decide to 
make this change, choose another subclass that  be­
longs to your class and replace all your old subclass 
features with the features of the new subclass that 
are for your new level and lower. 

TRAINING  TIME 

To change your subclass, your DM  might require 
you to spend time devoted to the transition, as 
you study the ways of the new specialization. This 
transition requires a number of days equal to twice 
your new level in the class; a higher level represents 
more to learn. 

The DM might also require an expenditure of 

money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other 
goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 
100 gp times your new level. This cost might be 
accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, 
a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline 
could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or 
both from an ancient dragon. 

If you return to a subclass that you previously 
held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required 
for the transition is halved. 

SUDDEN  CHANGE 

Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic 
transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When 
a character experiences a profound self-realization 
or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, 
beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate 
subclass change.  Here are a few examples: 

•  An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a de­

monic horde from ravaging her homeland. After 
spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the 
next morning with the features of the Oath of Ven­
geance, ready to hunt down the horde. 

•  A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree 

whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, 
he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When 

·  he awakens, his subclass features have been re­

placed by those of the School of Divination. 
•  A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in 

conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one 
day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where 
her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's 
suffering.  Drinking from the glade's brook, the 
cleric is filled with such compassion for all people 
that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, 
ready to heal rather than make war.

ARTIFICER 
Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and 
magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in ob­
jects. They see magic as a complex system waiting 
to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells 
and inventions. You can find everything you need to 
play one of these inventors in the next few sections. 
Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their 
arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use 
alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, callig­
rapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tin­
ker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of 
artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and 
few other characters can produce the right tool for a 
job as well as an artificer. 

ARTIFICERS  IN  MANY WORLDS 

Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create 
inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many 
lives have been brightened or saved because of the 
work of kind artificers, but countless lives have 
also been lost because of the mass destruction un­
leashed by certain artificers' creations. 

In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is 
home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragon­
lance, tinker gnomes are often members of this 
class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks 
of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk 
to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, var­
ious nations employ artificers to keep airships and 
other wondrous devices operational. 

Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries 
from throughout the multiverse, and from there, 
the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning 
business that hires adventurers to fix problems that 
others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, 
magic is harnessed as a form of science and de­
ployed throughout society, largely as a result of the 
wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been dis­
covered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. 
If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms 
in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer 
has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, 
your artificer is proficient with them. 

STARTING EQUI PMENT 
You start with the following equipment, in addition 
to the equipment granted by your background: 

any two simple weapons of your choice 

•  a light crossbow and 20 bolts 
•  your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail 
•  thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack 

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the 

items offered by your background, you start with 
5d4  x  10 gp to buy your equipment.

C LA S S  FEATUR E S  

As an artificer, you gain the following class features, 
which are summarized in the Artificer table. 

MAGICAL TINKERING 

1st-level artificer feature 

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into 
mundane objects. To  use this ability, you must have 
thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then 
touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and 
give it one of the following magical properties of 
your choice: 

•  The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and 

dim light for an additional 5 feet. 

•  Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a 
recorded message that  can be heard up to  10 feet 
away. You utter the message when you bestow this 
property on the object, and the recording can be 
no more than 6 seconds long. 

•  The object continuously emits your choice of an 

odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, 
or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceiv­
able up to  10 feet away. 

•  A static visual effect appears on one of the object's 

surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to  25 
words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of 
these elements, as you like. 

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an 
action, you can touch the object and end the prop­
erty early. 

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, 

touching one object each time you use this feature, 
though a single object can only bear one property 
at a time. The maximum number of objects you 
can affect with this feature at one time is equal to 
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one ob­
ject). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest 
property immediately ends, and then the new prop­
erty applies. 

SPELLCASTING 

1st-level artificer feature 

You've studied the workings of magic and how to 
cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. 
To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells 
in a conventional way; you appear to produce 
wonders from mundane items and outlandish 
inventions.· 

TOOLS R EQUI R E D  
You produce your artificer spell effects through your 
tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifi­
cally thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in 
hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting 
feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component 

TH E  MACI C  OF A R TI FI CE 

As an  artificer, you  use tools when you  cast your 
spells. When describing your s pellcasting, think a bout 
how you're using a tool. For example, if you  cast cure 
wounds using a lchemist's s u pplies ,  you  coul d  be 
q uickly producing a  salve. If you cast it  using tin ker's 
tools, you m ight have a  m i niature mechan ical spider 
that binds wou nds. The effect of the  spell is the same 
either way. 

Such  details don't l i m it you  in  any way or provide you 

with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't 
h ave to j ustify  how you 're using tool s  to cast a s pell. 
B ut describing your spel lcasting creatively is a fu n way 
to d istinguish yourself from other s pellcasters. 

when you cast it). You must be proficient with the 
tool to use it in this way.  See the equipment chap­
ter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of 
these tools. 

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, 

you can also use any item bearing one of your infu­
sions as a spellcasting focus. 

CANTRIPS  (0-LEVEL SPELL S) 
You know two cantrips of your choice from the arti­
ficer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional 
artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the 
Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. 

When you gain a level in this class, you can re­
place one of the artificer can trips you know with 
another cantrip from the artificer spell list. 

P R E PA R I NG A N D  CASTING SPELLS 
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you 
have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your 
artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must ex­
pend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are 

available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer 
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of arti­
ficer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half 
your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one 
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots. 

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you 

have four 1 st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. 
With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared 
spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in 
any combination. If you prepare the  1 st-level spell 
cure wounds, you can cast it using a  1st-level or a 
2nd-level slot.  Casting the spell doesn't remove it 
from your list of prepared spells. 

You can change your list of prepared spells when 
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artifi­
cer spells requires time spent tinkering with your 
spellcasting focuses: at least  1 minute per spell level 
for each spell on your list. 

C H AP T E R  I  I  C H A RACTER OPTIONS

SPELLCASTING ABILITY 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arti­
ficer spells; your understanding of the theory behind 
magic allows you to wield these spells with superior 
skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, 
you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the 
saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and 
when making an attack roll with one. 

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your 
I ntelligence mod ifier 
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your 
I ntell igence modifier 

RITUAL CAST I NG 
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell 
has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. 

ARTIFICER SPELL LI ST 
Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn 
an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level, 
not charader level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, 
the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. 

Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it 
has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two aster­
isks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).

2nd-level artificer feature 

You've gained the  ability to  imbue mundane items 
with certain magical infusions, turning those ob­
jects into magic items. 

I N F USIONS KNOW N  
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer in­
fusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infu­
sions" section at the end of the class's description. 
You learn additional infusions of your choice when 
you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in 
the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. 

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can re­
place one of the artificer infusions you learned with 
a new one. 

I N F US I NG  AN  ITEM 
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a 
nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your 
artificer infusions, turning it into a magic  item. An 
infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as 
specified in the infusion's description. If the item re­
quires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the 
instant you infuse the item.  If you decide to  attune to 
the item later, you must do so using the normal pro­
cess for attunement (see the attunement rules in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but 
when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number 
of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (mini­
mum of 1  day). The infusion also vanishes if you 
replace your knowledge of the infusion. 

. 
more than one nonmagical object 

You can infuse

at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of 
objects appears in the Infused Items column of the 
Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, 
and each  of your infusions can be in only one object 
at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than 
one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed 
your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infu­
sion ends, and then the new infusion applies. 

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other 
things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly 
appear in and around its space. 

ARTIFICER  SPECIALIST 

3rd-level artificer feature 

Choose  the type of specialist you  are: Alchemist, 
Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which 
is detailed after the class's description. Your choice 
grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 
1 5th level. 

THE  RIGHT TOOL FOR THE  OB 

3rd-level artificer feature 

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you 
need: with  thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, 
you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in 
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This cre­
ation requires  1  hour of uninterrupted work, which 
can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the 
product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they 
vanish when you use this feature again. 

ABILITY  SCORE  IMPROVEMENT 

4th-level artificer feature 

When you reach 4th level and  again  at 8th,  1 2th, 
1 6th, and 1 9th level, you can increase one abil­
ity score of your choice by 2, or you can increase 
two ability scores of your choice by  1.  As normal, 
you  can't increase an ability score above  20 using 
this feature.

6th-level artificer feature 

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any 
ability check you make that uses your proficiency 
with a tool. 

FLASH  OF  GENIUS 

7th-level artificer feature 

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions 
under pressure. When you or another creature you 
can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check 
or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add 
your Intelligence modifier to the roll. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). 
You regain all  expended uses when you finish a 
long rest. 

MAGIC ITEM ADEPT 

10th-level artificer feature 

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to 
use and  make  magic items: 

•  You can attune to up to four magic items at once. 
•  If you craft a magic item with a rarity of com­

mon or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the 
normal time, and it costs you half as much of the 
usual gold. 

SPELL- STORING  ITEM 

1 1th-level artificer feature 

You can now store a spell  in an object. Whenever 
you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or 
martial weapon or one item that you can use as a 
spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choos­
ing a  1 st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell 
list that requires  1  action to cast (you needn't have it 
prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an 

action to produce the spell's effect from it, using 
your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell re­
quires concentration, the creature must concentrate. 
The spell stays in the object until it's been used a 
number of times equal to twice your Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this 
feature again to store a spell in an object.

•  You ignore all class, race, spell, and level require­

ments on attuning to or using a magic item. 

MAGIC ITEM MASTER 

18th-level artificer feature 

You can now attune to up to six  magic items at once. 

SOUL  OF ARTIFICE 

20th-level artificer feature 

You have developed a mystical connection to your 
magic items, which you can draw on for protection: 

•  You gain a +1  bonus to  all saving throws per 

magic item you are currently attuned to. 

•  If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out­

right, you can use your reaction  to end one of your 
artificer infusions, causing you to drop to  1  hit 
point instead of 0.

EXPERIM ENTAL ELI X I R  
3rd-level Alchemist feature 

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magi­
cally produce an experimental elixir in an empty 
flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir 
table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when 
someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature 
can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapaci­
tated creature. 

You can create additional experimental elixirs 
by expending a spell slot of 1 st level or higher for 
each one. When you do so, you use your action to 
create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and 
you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental 
Elixir table. 

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to 
have alchemist supplies on your person, and any 
elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is 
drunk or until the end of your next long rest. 

When you reach certain levels in this class, you 
can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two 
at 6th level and three at  1 5th level. Roll for each 
elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its 
own flask.

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents 
to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their 
creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy 
is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility 
has long been valued during times of war and peace.

ALC H E M ICAL  SAVANT 
5th-level Alchemist feature 

You've developed masterful command of magical 
chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you 
create through them. Whenever you cast a spell 
using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting 
focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That 
roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that 
deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and 
the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (mini­
mum of +l). 

R ESTORATIVE R EAGENTS 
9th-level Alchemist feature 

You can incorporate restorative reagents into some 
of your works: 

•  Whenever a creature drinks an experimental 

elixir you created, the creature  gains temporary 
hit points equal to  2d6 + your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of 1  temporary hit point). 

•  You can cast lesser restoration without expend­
ing a spell slot and without preparing the spell, 
provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spell­
casting focus. You can do so a number of times 
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 
once), and you regain all expended uses when you 
finish a long rest. 

C H E M I CAL MASTERY 
15th-level Alchemist feature 

You  have been exposed to so many chemicals that 
they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to 
quickly end  certain ailments: 

•  You gain resistance to acid damage and poison 
damage, and you are immune to the poisoned 
condition. 

•  You can cast greater restoration  and heal without 

expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, 
and without material components, provided you 
use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. 
Once you cast ·either spell with this feature, you 
can't  cast that spell with it again until you finish a 
long rest.

An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies 
armor to function almost like a second skin. The 
armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, 
unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable 
defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becom­
ing one with it even as they experiment with it and 
refine its magical capabilities.

ARCAN E  ARMOR 
3rd-level Armorer feature 

Your metallurgical pursuits have  led to you mak­
ing armor a  conduit for your magic. As an action, 
you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing 
into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's 
tools in hand. 

You gain the following benefits while wearing 

this armor: 

•  If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, 
the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you. 

•  You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting 

focus for your artificer spells. 

•  The armor attaches to you and can't be removed 
against your will. It also expands to cover your 
entire body,  although you can retract or deploy the 
helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any

• 

missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb 
it replaces. 

•  You can doff or don the armor as an action. 

The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until 

you don another suit of armor or you die. 

ARMOR MODEL 
3rd-level Armorer feature 

You can customize your Arcane Armor.  When you 
do so, choose one of the following armor models: 
Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives 
you special benefits while you wear it. 

Each model includes a special weapon. When you 

attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelli­
gence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to 
the attack and damage rolls. 

You can change the armor's model whenever you 
finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's 
tools in hand. 

Guardian. You design your armor to be in the 
front line of conflict. It has the following features: 

T hunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets 
counts as a simpl_e melee weapon while you aren't 
holding anything in it, and it deals  ld8 thunder 
damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has 
disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other 
than you until the start of your next turn, as the ar­
mor magically emits a distracting pulse when the 
creature attacks someone else. 

Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain 
temporary hit points equal to your level in this 
class, replacing any temporary hit points you al­
ready have. You lose these temporary hit points if 
you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action 
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, 
and you regain all expended uses when you finish 
a long rest. 

Infiltrator.  You customize your armor for subtle 

undertakings. It has the following features: 

Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on 
one of your armored fists or on the chest (your 
choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with 
a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 
feet, and it deals  ld6 lightning damage on a hit. 
Once on each of your turns when you hit a crea­
ture with it, you can deal an extra  ld6 lightning 
damage to that target. 

Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases 
.  by 5 feet. 
Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes 
disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and 
disadvantage cancel each other, as normal. 

EXTRA ATTACK 
5th-level Armorer feature 

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever 
you take the Attack action on your turn.

TOOL P ROF I C I E NCY 
3rd-level Artillerist feature 

You learn how to use your artificer infusions to spe­
cially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now 
counts as separate items for the purposes of your 
Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, 
helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of 
those items can bear one of your infusions, and the 
infusions transfer over if you change your armor's 
model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, 
the maximum number of items you can infuse at 
once increases by 2, but those extra items must be 
part of your Arcane Armor. 

You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you 
already have  this proficiency, you gain proficiency 
with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice. 

ARTILLERIST  SPELLS 
3rd-level Artillerist feature 

You always have certain spells prepared after you 
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the 
Artillerist Spells table.  These  spells count as arti­
ficer spells for you, but they don't count against the 
number of artificer spells you prepare. 

PERFECTED ARMOR 
15th-level Armorer feature 

Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based 
on its model, as shown below. 

Guardian. When a Huge or smaller creature you 
can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can 
use your reaction to magically force the creature to 
make a Strength saving throw against your spell 
save DC,  pulling the creature up to 30 feet toward 
you to an unoccupied space.  If you pull the target to 
a space within 5 feet of you, you can  make a melee 
weapon attack against it as part of this reaction. 

You can use this reaction a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses of it when you finish a long rest. 

Infiltrator.  Any creature that takes lightning dam­

age from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with 
magical light until the start of your next turn. The 
glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot ra­
dius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against 
you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, 
the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if 
that attack hits, the target takes an extra  ld6 light­
ning damage.

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl 
energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. 
This destructive power is valued by armies in the 
wars on many different worlds. And when war 
passes, some members of this specialization seek to 
build a more  peaceful world by using their powers 
to fight the  resurgence of strife. The world-hopping 
gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about 
making things right: "It's about time we fixed things 
instead of blowing them all to hell."

ELDRITCH  CAN NON 
3rd-level Artillerist feature 

You've learned how to create a magical cannon. 
Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can 
take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny 
eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a hori­
zontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch 
cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be 
held in one hand. 

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again 

until you finish a long rest or until you expend a 
spell slot to create one. You  can have only one can­
non at a time and can't create one while your can­
non is present. 

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of 
size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of 
hit points equal to five  times your artificer level. It is 
immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it 
is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, 
treat all its ability scores as 1 0  (+O). If the mending 
spell is  cast on  it, it  regains 2d6 hit points. It  disap­
pears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1  hour. 
You can dismiss it early as an action. 

When you create the cannon, you determine its 
appearance and whether it has legs. You also de­
cide which type it is, choosing from the options on 
the Eldritch  Cannons  table.  On each of your turns, 
you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to 
activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the 
same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to 
walk or climb up to  1 5  feet to an unoccupied space, 
provided it has legs.

ARCAN E  FIREARM 
5th-level Artillerist feature 

You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod  into  an 
arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. 
When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarv­
er's tools to carve special  sigils into a wand, staff, 
or rod and thereby turn  it into your arcane firearm. 
The sigils disappear from the object if you later 
carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise 
last indefinitely. 

You  can  use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting 

focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an ar­
tificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you 
gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal 
to the number rolled. 

EXPLOSIVE  CANNON 
9th-level Artillerist feature 

Every eldritch cannon you create is now more 
destructive: 

•  The cannon's damage rolls all increase by ld8. 
•  As an action, you can command the cannon to 

detonate if you are  within 60 feet of it. Doing so 
destroys the cannon and forces each creature 
within  20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving 
throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force 
damage on a failed save or half as much damage 
on a successful one. 

FORT I F I E D  POS ITION 
15th-level Artillerist feature 

You're a master at forming well-defended emplace­
ments using your Eldritch Cannon: 

•  You and your allies have half cover while within 
10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Can­
non, as a result of a shimmering field of magical 
protection that the cannon emits. 

•  You can now have two cannons at the same time. 
You can create two with the same action (but not 
the  same spell slot), and you can activate both of 
them with the  same  bonus action. You determine 
whether the cannons are identical to each other 
or different. You can't create a third cannon while 
you have two.

Armies require protection, and  someone  has to put 
things back together if defenses fail. A combination 
of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert 
at defending others and repairing both materiel and 
personnel. To  aid in their work, Battle Smiths are 
accompanied by a steel defender, a protective com­
panion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell sto­
ries of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle 
Smith and a steel defender. 

In t.he world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played 
a key role in House Cannith's work on battle  con­

Your combat training and your experiments with 
magic have paid off in two ways: 

•  You gain proficiency with martial weapons. 
•  When you attack with a magic weapon, you 

can use your I ntelligence modifier, instead of 
Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and

STEEL DEFENDER 
3rd-level Battle Smith feature 

Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel 
defender. It's friendly to you and your companions, 
and it obeys your commands. See its game statis­
tics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses 
your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You 
determine the  creature's appearance and whether it 

has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its 
game statistics. 

In combat, the defender shares your initiative 
count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. 
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the 
only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, 
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com­
mand it to take another action. That action can be 
one in its stat block or some other action. If you are 
incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its 
choice, not just Dodge. 

If the mending spell is cast on the defender, it 
regains 2d6 hit points.  If it has died within the last 
hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action 
to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and 
you expend a spell slot of 1 st level or higher. The 
defender returns to life after 1  minute with all its hit 
points restored. 

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new 
steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If 
you already have a defender from this feature, the 
first one immediately perishes. The defender also 
perishes if you die.

9th-level Battle Smith feature 

You've learned new ways to channel arcane energy 
to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with 
a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a 
target, you can channel magical energy through the
strike to create one of the following effects: 

•  The target takes an extra  2d6 force damage. 
•  Choose one creature or object you can see within 
30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the 
chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it. 

You can use this energy a number of times equal

ARTI FIC E R  I N FUSIONS 

Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that 
rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. 
The description of each of the following infusions 
details the type of object that can receive it, along 
with whether the resulting magic item requires 
attunement. 

Some infusions specify a minimum  artificer level. 

You can't learn such an infusion until you are at 
least that level. 

Unless an infusion's  description says otherwise, 

you can't learn an infusion more than once.

proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 
ld8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown 
property,  with a normal range  of 20 feet and a 
long range of 60 feet.  When thrown, the gauntlet 
detaches and flies at the attack's target, then im­
mediately returns to the wearer and reattaches. 

•  The armor can't be removed against the 

wearer's will. 

•  If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor 

replaces those limbs-hands, arms, feet, legs, or 
similar appendages. The replacements function 
identically to the body parts they replace. 

ARMOR OF MAGICAL STRENGTH 
Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement) 

This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend 
the armor's charges in the following ways: 

•  When the  wearer makes a Strength check or a 
Strength saving throw, it can expend  1  charge 
to add a bonus to the  roll equal to its Intelli­
gence modifier. 
If the creature would be knocked  prone,  it can 
use its reaction to expend 1  charge to avoid being 
knocked prone. 

The armor regains  ld6 expended charges 
daily at dawn.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your com­

panions, and it obeys your commands. See this 
creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Ser­
vant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus 
(PB) in several places. 

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative 
count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. 
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the 
only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, 
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com­
mand it to take another action. That action can be 
one in its stat block or some other action. If you are 
incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action 
of its choice, not just Dodge. 

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the 

mending spell is cast on it.  If you or the homunculus 
dies, it vanishe�. leaving its heart in its space.

concentration on a spell, the wearer can use its re­
action to expend  1  of the item's charges to succeed 
instead. The item regains  ld4 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 

RADIANT WEAPON 
Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer 
Item: A simple or martial weapon (requires 
attunement)

damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the 
wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed 
bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an 
additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the 
light as a bonus action. 

The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immedi­
ately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can ex­
pend  1  charge and cause the attacker to be blinded 
until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the 
attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw 
against your spell save DC. The weapon regains  ld4 
expended charges daily at dawn. 

REPEATING SHOT 
Item: A simple or martial weapon  with  the ammuni­
tion property (requires attunement) 

This magic weapon grants a + 1  bonus to  attack and 
damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a 
ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if 
it has it. 

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it pro­
duces its own, automatically creating one piece of 
magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack 
with it. The ammunition created by the weapon van­
ishes the instant after it hits or misses a target. 

REPLICATE  MAGIC  ITEM 
Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic 
item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; 
each time you do so, choose a magic item that you 
can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items 
tables. A table's title tells you the level you must be 
in the class to choose an item from the table. Alter­
natively, you can choose the magic item from among 
the common magic items in the game, not including 
potions or scrolls. 

In the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the 
item requires attunement. See the item's description 
in the Dungeon Master's Guide for more informa­
tion about it, including the type of object required 
for its making.

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw 
their rage from a bestial spark burning within their 
souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, 
physically transforming the barbarian. 

Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal 
spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can 
choose the origin of your feral might or determine it 
by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

FORM OF THE  BEAST 
3rd-level Path  of the Beast feature 

When you enter your rage, you can transform, re­
vealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage 
ends, you manifest a natural weapon. It counts as 
a simple melee weapon for you, and you add your 
Strength modifier to the attack and damage  rolls 
when you attack with it, as normal. 

You choose the weapon's form each time you rage: 

Bite. Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle 
or great mandibles (your choice). It deals ld8 
·  piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your 
turns when you damage a creature with this bite, 
you regain a number of hit points equal to your 
proficiency bonus, provided you have less than 
half your hit points when you hit. 

Claws. Each of your hands transforms into a claw, 
which you can use as a weapon  if it's empty. It 
deals  ld6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each 
of your turns when you attack with a claw using

C H A PT E R  1  I  C H A R ACTER  OPTIONS 

the Attack action, you can make one additional 
claw attack as part of the same action. 

Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals  ld8 
piercing damage on a hit and has the reach prop­
erty. If a creature you can see within  10 feet of 
you hits you with an attack roll, you  can  use your 
reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying 
a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled, po­
tentially causing the attack to miss you. 

B E STIAL SOUL 
6th-level Path  of the Beast feature 

The feral power within you increases, causing the 
natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count 
as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance 
and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 
You can also alter your form to help you adapt to 
your surroundings. When you finish a short or long 
rest, choose one of the following benefits, which 
lasts until you finish your next short or long rest: 

•  You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking 

speed, and you can breathe underwater. 

•  You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking 

speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, includ­
ing upside down on ceilings, without needing to 
make an ability check. 

•  When you jump, you can make a Strength (Athlet­
ics) check and extend your jump by a number of 
feet equal to the check's total. You can make this 
special check only once per turn. 

INFECTIOUS F U RY 
10th-level Path  of the Beast feature 

When you hit a creature with your natural weapons 
while you are raging, the beast within you can curse 
your target with rabid fury. The target must succeed 
on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your 
Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or 
suffer one of the following effects (your choice): 

•  The target must use its reaction to make a melee 

attack against another creature of your choice that 
you can see. 

•  The target takes 2d 1 2  psychic damage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended  uses when you finish a  long rest. 

CALL THE HUNT 
14th-level Path  of the Beast feature 

The beast within you  grows so powerful that you 
can spread its ferocity to  others  and gain resilience 
from them joining your hunt. When you enter your 
rage, you can choose a number of other willing crea­
tures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your 
Constitution  modifier (minimum of one creature). 

You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature 
that accepts this feature. Until the rage  ends,  the 
chosen creatures can each use the following benefit 
once on each of their turns: when the creature hits a 
target with an attack roll and deals damage to it, the 
creature can roll a d6 and gain a bonus to the dam­
age equal to the number rolled. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.

TASHA 

Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, 
intense emotion, and  rampant magic; the  Feywild, 
the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural 
power radiate with such forces and can profoundly 
influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians 
are especially susceptible to these wild influences, 
with some barbarians being transformed by the 
magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the 
Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi 
barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest 
the otherworldly magic of their ancestors. 

MAGIC AWAREN E S S  
3rd-level Path  of Wild Magic feature 

As an  action, you can open your awareness to the 
presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of 
your next turn, you know the location of any spell 
or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn't behind 
total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which 
school of magic it belongs to. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest.

3rd-level Path of Wild Magic feature 

The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes 
erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on

MAGICAL INSPIRATION 

2nd-level bard feature 

If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you 
and  casts a spell  that  restores  hit points or deals 
damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a 
target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled 
as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage 
dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost. 

BARDIC VERSATILITY 

4th-level bard feature 

Whenever you reach a  level  in  this class that grants 
the Ability Score I mprovement feature, you can do 
one of the following, representing a change in focus 
as you use your skills and magic: 

•  Replace one of the skills you chose for the Exper­
tise feature with one of your other skill proficien­
cies that isn't benefiting from Expertise. 

•  Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's 

Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the 
bard spell list. 

BARD  C OLLEGE S 

At 3rd level, a bard  gains  the  Bard College feature, 
which offers you the choice of a subclass. The fol­
lowing options are available to you when making 
that choice: College of Creation and College of 
Eloquence.

TA�HA 

Bards believe the  cosmos is a work of art-the cre­
ation of the  first  dragons  and  gods.  That creative 
work included harmonies that continue to resound 
through  existence today, a power known as the 
Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Cre­
ation draw on that primeval song through dance, 
music, and poetry, and their teachers share this 
lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the 
Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melo­
dies so delighted the stones and trees that some of 
them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing 
too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach 
the mountains to sing and dance." 

Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards 

to become students of the Song of Creation. And 
among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, 
for legends portray  Bahamut and Tiamat-the great­
est of dragons-as two of the song's first singers. 

MOTE  OF POTENTIAL 
3rd-level College of Creation feature 

Whenever you give a creature a  Bardic Inspiration 
die, you can utter a note from the Song of Creation 
to create a Tiny mote of potential, which orbits 
within 5 feet of that  creature. The mote is intangi­
ble and invulnerable, and it lasts until the Bardic 

2 8  

C H A PT E R  1  I  C H A RACTER  OPTION S 

Inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical 
note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life 
that you choose. 

When the creature uses the Bardic Inspiration 
die, the mote provides an additional effect based on 
whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack 
roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below: 

Ability Check. When the creature rolls the Bardic 
Inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the 
creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die again 
and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops 
and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment. 

Attack Roll. Immediately after the creature rolls 

the Bardic Inspiration die to add it to an attack roll 
against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. 
The target and each creature of your choice that 
you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a 
Constitution saving throw against your spell save 
DC or take thunder damage equal to  the  number 
rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die. 

Saving T hrow. Immediately after the creature rolls 
the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving 
throw, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft 
music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit 
points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic 
Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (mini­
mum of 1  temporary hit point). 

PERFORMANCE  OF  C REATION 
3rd-level College of Creation feature 

As an action, you can  channel the magic of the Song 
of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your 
choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. 
The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid 
that can support it. The gp value of the item can't 
be more than 20 times your bard level, and the item 
must be Medium or smaller. The item glimmers 
softly, and a creature can faintly hear music when 
touching it. The created item disappears after a 
number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. 
For examples of items you can create, see the equip­
ment chapter of the Player's Handbook. 

Once you  create an item with this feature, you 
can't do so again until you finish a  long rest, unless 
you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use 
this feature again. You can have only one item cre­
ated by this feature at a time; if you use this action 
and already have an item from this feature, the first 
one immediately vanishes. 

The size of the item you can create with this fea­
ture increases by one size category when you reach 
6th level (Large) and  14th level (Huge).

ANIMATING PERFORMANCE 
6th-level College of Creation feature 

As an action, you  can  target a Large or smaller non­
magical item you can see within 30 feet of you and 
animate it. The animate item uses the Dancing Item 
stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB). 
The item is friendly to you and your companions and 
obeys your commands. It lives for  1  hour, until it is 
reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die. 

In combat, the item shares your initiative count, 
but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can 
move and use its reaction on its own, but the only 
action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless 
you take a bonus action on your turn to command it 
to take another action. That action can be one in its 
stat block or some other action. If you are incapaci­
tated, the item can take any action of its choice, not 
just Dodge. 

When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you 

can command the item as part of the  same bonus 
action you use for Bardic Inspiration. 

Once you animate an item with this feature, you 
can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless 
you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use 
this feature again. You can have only one item ani­
mated by this feature at a time; if you use this action 
and already have a dancing item from this feature, 
the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

When you use your Performance of Creation fea­

The number of items equals your Charisma modi­
fier (minimum of two items). If you create an item 
that would exceed that number, you choose which 
of the previously created items disappears. Only one 
of these items can be of the maximum size you can 
create; the rest must be Small or Tiny. 

You are no longer limited by gp value when creat­

ing items with Performance of Creation.

Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the

detractors with logical arguments and plucking at 
heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.

SILVER TONGUE 
3rd-level College of Eloquence feature 

You are a master at  saying the right thing at the 
right time. When you make a Charisma (Persua­
sion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a 
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a  10. 

UNSETTLING WORDS 
3rd-level College of Eloquence feature 

You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle 
a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus 
action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspi­
ration and choose one creature you can see within 
60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The 
creature must subtract the number rolled from the 
next saving throw it makes before the start of your 
next turn. 

UNFAILING INSPIRATION 
6th-level College of Eloquence feature 

Your inspiring words are  so persuasive that others 
feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one 
of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the 
creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die. 

UNIVERSAL SPEECH 
6th-level College of Eloquence feature 

You gain the ability to make your speech intelligible 
to any creature. As an action, choose one or more 
creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number 
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one 
creature). The chosen creatures can magically un­
derstand you, regardless of the language you speak, 
for 1  hour. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
spell slot of any level to  use it again. 

I NFECTIOUS INSPIRATION 
14th-level College of Eloquence feature 

When you successfully inspire someone, the power 
of your eloquence can now spread to  someone else. 
When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of 
your Bardic I nspiration dice to its ability check, at­
tack roll, or saving throw and  the  roll succeeds, you 
can use your reaction to encourage a different crea­
ture (other than yourself) that can hear you within 
60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die with­
out expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses. 

You can use this ·reaction a number of times equal 

to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest.

C LERIC 

The cleric class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIONA L  C LA S S  FEATURE S 

You gain  class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a cleric. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand­
book, you don't gain the features here  automatically. 
Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to 
gain a feature in this section if you meet the  level re­
quirement noted in the feature's description. These 
features can be selected separately from one an­
other; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, 
you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't 
qualify for anything in the game that requires it. 

ADDITIONAL  CLERIC  SPELLS 

1st-level cleric feature 

The spells in the following list expand the cleric 
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is orga­
nized by spell level, not character level.  If a spell can 
be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the 
spell's name. Each spell is in the Player's  Handbook, 
unless it has an asterisk (a  spell in chapter 3). Xana­
thar's Guide to Everything also offers more spells.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest. 

CANTRIP VERSATILITY 

4th-level cleric feature 

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants 
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can 
replace one cantrip you learned from this class's 
Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the 
cleric spell list. 

B LESSED  STRIKES 

8th-level cleric feature,  which replaces the Divine 
Strike or Potent Spellcasting feature 

You are blessed with divine might in  battle. When a 
creature takes damage from one of your can trips or 
weapon attacks, you can  also  deal  1d8 radiant dam­
age to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you 
can't use this feature again until the start of your 
next turn. 

D I VI N E  D OM A I N S  

At 1 st level, a cleric gains the Divine Domain fea­
ture, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The 
following options are available to you when making 
that choice: Order Domain, Peace Domain, and Twi­
light Domain. 

ORDER  D OMAIN 

fi�l.\lly,  I.\  whole fl.\ith l.\bo1At coiori�1 i�1i&e the li�e\. 

TASHA 

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as 
devotion to the laws that govern a society, an insti­
tution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on 
logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples 
of which appear in the Order Deities table. 

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws es­
tablish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by 
law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must 
do so to the best of their ability, and if those who 
lead fail to protect the law, they must be  replaced. In 
this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that 
create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

magical energy to compel others. 

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using 

a spell slot of 1 st level or higher, you can change 
the spell's casting time to  1  bonus action for this

8th-level Order Domain feature 

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes 
with divine energy. Once on each of your turns 
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you 
can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic 
damage to the target. When you reach  14th level, the 
extra damage increases to 2d8.

Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under 
the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you

start of your next turn. The next time one of your 
allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy 
communities, between friendly nations, and in the 
souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire 
people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up 
against those forces that try to prevent peace from 
flourishing. See the  Peace Deities table for a list of 
some of the  gods associated with this domain. 

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the sign­
ing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate 
in disputes.  These clerics' blessings draw people 
together and help them shoulder one another's 
burdens, and the  clerics'  magic  aids those who are 
driven to fight for the way of peace.

you choose a number of willing creatures within  30 
feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your 
proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among 
them for  10 minutes or until you use this feature

protect each other. When a creature affected by your 
Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, 
a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first 
can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied 
space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second 
creature then takes all the damage instead.

is centered on you, has a  30-foot radius, and is filled 
with dim light. The sphere moves with you, and it 
lasts for 1  minute or until you are incapacitated or 
die. Whenever a creature (including you) ends its 
turn  in the sphere, you can grant that creature one 
of these benefits: 

•  You grant it temporary hit points equal to  ld6 plus 

your cleric level. 

•  You end one effect on it causing it to be charmed 

or frightened. 

STE PS OF  NIGHT 
6th-level  Twilight Domain feature 

You  can draw on  the  mystical power of night to rise 
into the air. As a bonus action when you are in dim 
light or darkness, you  can magically give yourself 
a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 
minute. You can use this bonus action a number of 
times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you re­
gain all  expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

D I V I N E  STRI KE 
8th-level Twilight Domain feature 

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes 
with divine energy. Once on each of your turns 
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you 
can cause the  attack to deal an extra ld8 radiant 
damage. When you reach  14th level, the extra dam­
age increases to 2d8. 

TW I LIGHT S H ROUD 
17th-level Twilight Domain feature 

The  twilight that you summon offers a protective 
embrace: you and your allies have half cover while 
in the sphere created by your Twilight  Sanctuary.

DRUID 

The druid class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIO NAL C LA S S  FEATU R E S  

You  gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a druid. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand­
book, you don't gain  the features here automatically. 
Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to 
gain a feature in this section if you meet the  level re­
quirement noted in the feature's description. These 
features can be selected separately from one an­
other; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

ADDITIONAL  D RUID  SPELLS 

1st-level druid feature 

The spells in  the following list expand the  druid 
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is orga­
nized by spell  level, not character level.  If a spell can 
be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the 
spell's name. Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, 
unless it  has an asterisk (a spell  in chapter 3). Xana­
thar's Guide  to Everything also offers more spells.

Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. 
They see within mold  and other fungi the ability 
to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit 
somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that 
life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one 
leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't 
the end of life, but instead a change of state that 
sees life shift into a new form. 

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship 
with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong 
with undeath, which they consider to be a compan­
ion to life and death. But these druids believe that 
the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment 
of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to 
replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid 
passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must 
be thwarted. 

C I RCLE SPELLS 
2nd-level Circle of Spores feature 

Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap 
into the cycle of life and death grants you access 
to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the chill 
touch  cantrip. 

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to 
the  spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores 
Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these 
spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't 
count against the number of spells you can prepare 
each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't 
appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonethe­
less a druid spell for you.

2nd-level Circle of Spores feature 

You  are  surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores 
that are harmless until you unleash them on a crea­
ture nearby. When a creature you can see moves 
into a space within  10 feet of you or starts its turn 
there, you can use your reaction to deal  ld4 necrotic 
damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a 
Constitution saving throw against your spell save 
DC.  The  necrotic damage increases to  ld6 at 6th 
level,  ld8 at  10th level, and  ldlO at  14th level.

SYM B IOTIC E NTITY 
2nd-level Circle of Spores feature 

You gain the ability to channel magic into your 
spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your 
Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather 
than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 
temporary  hit points for each level you have in this 
class. While this feature is active, you gain the fol­
lowing benefits: 

•  When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, 

roll the damage die a second time and add it to 
the total. 

•  Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra  ld6 ne-

crotic damage to any target they hit. 

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose 
all these temporary hit points, or until you use your 
Wild Shape again. 

FUNGA L  I N F E STATION 
6th-level Circle of Spores feature 

Your spores  gain the ability to infest a corpse  and 
animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small 
or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use 
your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up 
immediately with  1  hit point. The creature uses 
the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It 
remains animate for 1  hour, after which time it col­
lapses and dies. 

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately 

after yours.  It obeys your mental commands, and 
the only action it can take is the Attack action, mak­
ing one melee attack. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a 
long rest. 

SPREAD I NG  SPORES 
10th-level Circle of Spores feature 

You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly 
spores. As a bonus action while your Symbiotic 
Entity feature is active, you can hurl spores up to 
30 feet away, where they swirl in a  10-foot cube for 
1  minute. The spores disappear early if you use 
this feature again, if you  dismiss them as a bonus 
action, or if your Symbiotic Entity feature is no lon­
ger active. 

Whenever a creature moves into the cube or 
starts its turn there, that creature takes your Halo 
of Spores damage, unless the creature succeeds on 
a Constitution saving throw against your spell save 
DC. A creature can take this damage no more than 
once per turn. 

While the cube of spores persists, you can't use 

your Halo of Spores reaction.

2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature 

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly 
studies.  It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spell­
casting focus for your druid  spells. You  determine 
its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by 
choosing one. 

While holding this map, you have these benefits: 

•  You know the guidance cantrip. 
•  You have the guiding bolt spell prepared. It 

counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn't 
count against the number of spells you can 
have prepared . 

•  You can  cast guiding bolt without expending a 

spell  slot. You can do so a number of times equal 
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a  long rest. 

If you  lose the map, you  can perform a  1 -hour cer­
emony to magically create a replacement. This cere­
mony can be performed during a short or Jong rest, 
and it destroys the previous map.

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the 
power of starlight. These druids have tracked heav­
enly patterns since time  immemorial, discovering 
secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing 
and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the 
Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos. 

Many druids of this circle keep records of the con­
stellations and the stars' effects on the world. Some 
groups document these observations at megalithic 
sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. 
These repositories might take the form of stone cir­
cles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground tem­
ples-any construction durable enough to protect 
the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great 
cataclysm.

STARRY FOR M  
2nd-level Circle of the Stars feature 

As a bonus action, you  can expend a use of your 
Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form, rather 
than transforming into a beast. 

While in your starry form, you retain your game 
statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your 
joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect 
them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light 
in a  10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
10 feet. The form lasts for  10 minutes. It ends early 
if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapaci­
tated, die, or use this feature again. 
·

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose
which of the following constellations glimmers on 
your body; your choice gives you certain benefits 
while in the form: 

Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on 

you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus 
action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you 
can  make a  ranged  spell  attack, hurling a lumi-

feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant dam­
age equal to ld8 + your Wisdom modifier. 

Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet ap­
pears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using 
a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, 
you or another creature within 30 feet of you 
can regain hit  points equal to  ld8 + your Wis­
dom modifier. 

Dragon. A constellation of a wise  dragon appears 
on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wis­
dom check or a Constitution saving throw to main­
tain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll 
of 9 or lower on the d20 as a  10. 

C O SMIC O M E N  
6th-level Circle of the Stars feature 

Whenever you fi nish a long rest, you can consult 
your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a 
die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain 
access to a special reaction based on whether you 
rolled an  even  or an odd  number on  the  die: 

Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see 

within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack 
roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can 
use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number 
rolled to the total. 

Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 
30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a 
saving throw, or an ability check, you can  use 
your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract  the number 
rolled from the total. 

You can use this reaction a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended  uses when you finish a long rest.

The constellations of your Starry Form  improve. 
The  ld8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 
2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a fly­

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while 
in your Starry Form, you can change which constel­
lation glimmers on your body.

TASHA 

Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that 
destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, 
such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. 
These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors 
both destructive and creative power,  allowing the 
druids to create controlled flames that burn away 
one thing but give life to another. 

C I RCLE SPELLS 
2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature 

You  have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a 
primal being of creation and destruction. Your link 
with this spirit grants you access to some spells 
when you reach certain levels in this class, as 
shown on the Circle of Wildfire Spells table. 

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you 
always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against 
the number of spells you can prepare each day. If 
you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on 
the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid 
spell for you.

SUMMON WI LDFIRE  SPIRIT 
2nd-level Circle of Wildfire feature 

You can summon the primal spirit bound to your 
soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your 
Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, 
rather than assuming a beast form. 

The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your 

choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each 
creature within  10 feet of the spirit (other than you) 
when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity sav­
ing throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 
fire damage. 

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions 

and obeys your commands. See this creature's 
game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, 
which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several 
places. You determine the spirit's appearance. Some 
spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of 
gnarled branches covered in flame, while others 
look like beasts wreathed in fire. 

WILDFIRE  SPIRIT 
Small elemental 

Armor Class 1 3  (natural armor) 
Hit Points 5 + five times your druid level 
Speed 30 ft., fly 30 ft.  (hover) 

In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, 

but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The 
only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, 
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to com­
mand it to take another action. That action can be 
one in its stat block or some other action. If you are 
incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its 
choice, not just Dodge. 

The spirit manifests for 1  hour, until it is reduced 
to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon 
the spirit again, or until you die. 

EN HANCED BOND 
6th-level Circle of Wildfire feature 

The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your de­
structive and restorative spells. Whenever you cast 
a spell that deals fire damage or restores hit points 
while your wildfire spirit is summoned, roll a d8, 
and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to 
one damage or healing roll of the spell. 

In addition, when you cast a spell with a range 
other than self, the spell can originate from you or 
your wildfire spirit. 

CAUTE RIZING FLA M E S  
10th-level Circle of Wildfire feature 

You gain the ability to turn death  into magical 
flames that can heal or incinerate. When a Small 
or larger creature dies withiff 30 feet of you or your 
wildfire spirit, a harmless spectral flame springs 
forth in the dead creature's space and flickers there 
for  1  minute. When a creature you can see enters 
that space, you can use your reaction to extinguish 
the spectral flame there and either heal the creature 
or deal fire damage to it. The healing or damage 
equals 2d10 + your Wisdom modifier. 

You can use this reaction a number of times equal

BLAZING REVIVAL 
14th-level Circle of Wildfire feature 

The  bond with your wildfire spirit can save you from 
death. If the  spirit is within 1 2 0  feet of you when 
you are reduced to 0 hit points and thereby fall un­
conscious, you can cause the spirit to drop to 0 hit 
points. You then regain half your hit points and im­
mediately rise to your feet.

FIGHTER 

The fighter class receives new features and  sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIONA L  C LA S S  FEATURE S 

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a fighter. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain  the features here automat­
ically.  Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description. 
These features can be selected separately from one 
another; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

FIGHTING  STYLE  OPTIONS 

1st-level fighter feature 

When you choose a fighting style, the following 
styles are added to your list of options. 

I NTERCE PTION 
When a creature you can see hits a target, other 
than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can 
use your reaction to reduce the damage the target 
takes by ldlO + your proficiency bonus (to a mini­
mum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or 
a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction. 

SUPERIOR TEC H N IQU E  
You learn one maneuver o f  your choice from among 
those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a 
maneuver you use requires your target to make a 
saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the 
saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus 
+ your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 
You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this 
die is added to any superiority dice you have from 
another source). This die is used to fuel your maneu­
vers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 
You regain your expended superiority dice when you 
finish a short or long rest. 

TH ROWN WEAPON FIGHTING 
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown prop­
erty as part of the attack you make with the weapon. 

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack 
using a thrown weapon, you  gain a +2 bonus to the 
damage roll. 

UNARMED FIGHTING 
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage 
equal to  ld6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you 
aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you 
make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. 

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 

ld4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grap­
pled by you. 

MARTI AL VERSATILITY 

4th-level fighter feature 

Whenever you  reach a level in  this class that grants 
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do 
one of the following, as you shift the focus of your 
martial practice: 

•  Replace a fighting style you know with another 

fighting style available to fighters. 
If you know any maneuvers from the Battle Mas­
ter archetype, you can replace one maneuver you 
know with a different maneuver. 

M A N E U V E R  OPTIONS 

I f  you have access to maneuvers, the following ma­
neuvers are added to the list of options available to 
you. Maneuvers are available to Battle Masters but 
also to characters who have a special feature like 
the Superior Technique fighting style or the Martial 
Adept feat. 

AMBUSH 

When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an 
initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die 
and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't in­
capacitated. 

BA IT AND  SWI TCH 

When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your 
turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch 
places with that creature, provided you spend at 
least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing 
and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't pro­
voke opportunity attacks. 

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next 
turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a 
bonus to AC equal to  the number rolled. 

BRACE 

When a creature you can see moves i nto the reach 
you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, 
you can use your reaction to expend one superiority 
die and make one attack against the creature, using 
that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority 
die to the weapon's damage roll. 

COMMANDI NG  PRESENCE 

When you make a Charisma (Intimidation), a Cha­
risma (Performance), or a Charisma (Persuasion) 
check, you can expend one superiority die and add 
the superiority die to the ability check. 

GRA PPLING  STRIKE 

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee 
attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority 
die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus 
action (see the Player's Handbook for rules on grap­
pling). Add the superiority die to your Strength (Ath­
letics) check. 

Qu1cK T o s s
As a bonus action, you  can expend one superiority 
die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that 
has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon 
as part of making th is attack. If you hit, add the su­
periority die to the weapon's damage roll. 

TACTICAL ASSESSMENT 

When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), an 
Intelligence (History), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, 
you can expend one superiority die and add the su­
periority die to the ability check. 

MARTIAL ARC H ETYPE S 

At  3rd level, a fighter gains the  Martial Archetype

Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior 
is a fighter who augments their physical might 
with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, 
and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki 
train to become such warriors, as do some of the 
most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eber­
ron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming 
Psi Warriors.

As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your 
psionic  abilities through solo discipline, unlocked 
it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an 
academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as 
both weapon and shield. 

PsIONIC Pow ER 
3rd-level Psi  Warrior feature 

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within 
yourself. This energy is represented by your 
Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You 
have a number of these dice equal to twice your 
proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic 
powers you have, which are detailed below. 

Some of your powers expend the  Psionic En­
ergy die they use, as specified in a power's de­
scription, and you can't use a power if it requires 
you to use a die when your dice are all expended. 
You  regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice 
when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bo­
nus action, you can regain one expended Psionic 
Energy die, but you can't do so again until you 
finish a short or long rest. 

When you reach certain levels in this class, the 
size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th 
level (d8), 1 1 th level (dlO), and  1 7th level (d l 2). 

The powers below use your Psionic 

Energy dice. 

Protective Field.  When you or another crea-

ture you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, 
you can use your reaction to expend one Psionic En­
ergy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken 
by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum reduction of 1 ), as you create a momen­
tary shield of telekinetic force. 

Psionic  Strike. You can propel your weapons 
with psionic force. Once on each of your turns,  im­
mediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you 
with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, 
you can expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it 
and dealing force damage to the target equal to the 
number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier. 

Telekinetic Movement. You can move an object 

or a creature with your mind. As an action, you 
target one loose object that is Large or smaller or 
one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can 
see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you 
can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space 
you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you 
can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you 
can  move the  target horizontally, vertically, or both. 
Once you take this action, you can't do so again un­
til you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend 
a Psionic Energy die to take it again. 

TELEKINETIC ADEPT 
7th-level Psi Warrior feature 

You  have  mastered new ways to use your telekinetic 
abilities, detailed below. 

Psi-Powered Leap.  As a bonus action, you can 
propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying 
speed equal to twice your walking speed until the 
end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus 
action, you can't do so again until you finish a short 
or long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die 
to take it again. 

Telekinetic  Thrust.  When you deal damage to a 

target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the 
target to make a Strength saving throw against a 
DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your I ntel­
ligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock the 
target prone or move it up to  10 feet in any direction 
horizontally. 

GUARDED M I N D  
10th-level Psi  Warrior feature 

The psionic energy flowing through you has bol­
stered your mind. You have resistance to psychic 
damage. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or 
frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and 
end every effect on yourself subjecting you to those 
conditions.

BULWAR K  OF  FORCE 
15th-level Psi Warrior feature 

You can shield yourself and  others with telekinetic 
force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, 
which can include you, that you can see within 30 
feet of you, up to a ·number of creatures equal to 
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one crea­
ture). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by 
half cover for 1  minute or until you're incapacitated. 
Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so 
again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 
a Psionic Energy die to take it again. 

TELEKINETIC MASTER 
J8th-level Psi Warrior feature 

Your ability to move creatures and objects with your 
mind is matched by few. You can cast the telekinesis 
spell, requiring no components, and your spellcast­
ing ability for the  spell is Intelligence. On each of 
your turns while you concentrate on the spell,  in­
cluding the turn when you cast it, you can make one 
attack with a weapon as a bonus action. 

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't 

do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you 
expend a  Psionic Energy die to cast it again.

TA�tlA 

Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using 
the supernatural power of runes, an ancient prac­
tice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can 
be found among any family of giants, and you likely 
learned your methods first or second  hand from 
such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the  gi­
ant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the 
runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you 
studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply 
magic runes to empower your equipment. 

BONUS P ROFICIENCIES 
3rd-level Rune Knight feature 

You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you 
learn to speak, read, and write Giant. 

RUN E  C ARVE R  
3rd-level Rune KniSht feature 
You can  use magic runes to enhance your gear. 
You learn two runes of your choice, from among 
the runes described below, and each time you gain 
a level in this class, you can replace one rune you

know with a different one from this feature. When 
you reach certain levels in this class, you learn addi­
tional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a 
number of objects equal to the number of runes you 
know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each 
of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a 
weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, 
or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. 
Your rune remains on an object until you finish a 
long rest,  and  an object can bear only one of your 
runes at a time. 

The following runes are available to you when you 

learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you 
must be at least that  level in this class to learn the 
rune. If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune 
Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Constitution modifier. 

Cloud Rune.  This rune emulates the deceptive 
magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing 
or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, 
you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
checks and Charisma (Deception) checks. 

In addition, when you or a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can 
use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a 
different creature within 30 feet of you, other than 
the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the tar­
get of the attack, using the same roll. This magic 
can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the 
attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't 
do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 

Fire Rune.  This rune's magic channels the mas­
terful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing 
or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your 
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check 
you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. 
In  addition, when you hit a creature with an at­
tack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to 
summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 
2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw or be restrained for  1  minute. While 
restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire 
damage at the start of each of its turns. The target 
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once 
you invoke this  rune, you can't do so again until you 
finish a short or long rest. 

Frost Rune. This rune's  magic evokes the might 
of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such 
as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object 
inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on 
Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma 
( Intimidation) checks. 

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, 
you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving 
throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you 
invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you fin­
ish a short or long rest. 

Stone Rune.  This rune's magic channels the judi­
ciousness associated with stone giants. While wear­
ing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, 
you have advantage on Wisdom ( Insight) checks, 
and you have darkvision out to a range of 1 2 0  feet. 
In addition, when a creature you can see ends its 
turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction 
to invoke the rune and force the creature to make 
a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, 
the creature is charmed by you for 1  minute. While 
charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 
0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy 
stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at 
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a 
success. Once you invoke this rune, you  can't do so 
again until you finish a short or long rest. 

Hill Rune (7th Level or Higher).  This rune's 
magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill gi­
ant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears 
this rune, you have advantage on saving throws 
against being poisoned, and you have resistance 
against poison damage. 

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, 
and slashing damage for 1  minute. Once you invoke 
this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a 
short or long rest. 

Storm Rune (7th Level or Higher).  Using this 
rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant 
seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed 
with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence 
(Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long 
as you aren't incapacitated. 

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus 
action to enter a prophetic state for 1  minute or until 
you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you 
or another creature you can see within 60 feet of 
you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an abil­
ity check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll 
to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke 
this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a 
short or long rest.

gain  the following benefits, which last for 1  minute: 

•  If you are smaller than Large, you become 

Large, along with anything you are wearing. If 
you lack the room to become Large, your size

Strength saving throws. 

•  Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks 

with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an

BATTLE  MAST E R  B U I L D S  

A Martial Archetype option i n  the Player's Hand­
book, the Battle Master showcases just how ver­
satile a fighter can  be.  The suite of maneuvers you 
choose, when combined with a fighting style and 
feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters, 
each with its own flavor and play style. Below are 
recommendations for how you might build a Battle 
Master to reflect various types of warriors. 

Each of these builds contains suggested fighting 

styles, maneuvers, and feats. Those suggestions 
are from the Player's Handbook, except for the ones 
followed by an asterisk, which indicates an option 
introduced in this book. 

ARCHER 

Fighting Style: Archery 
Maneuvers: Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike, 

Precision Attack 
Feats: Sharpshooter 

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, 
trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling 
bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on 
accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that 
"those who live by the sword die by the bow." 

BRAWLER 

Fighting Style: Blind Fighting,* Two-Weapon Fight­

ing, Unarmed Fighting* 

Maneuvers: Ambush,* Disarming Attack, Feinting 

Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack 

Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Resilient, Shield 

Master, Tavern Brawler, Tough 

When  bottles start breaking and chairs start flying, 
you're in your element. You love a good scrap, and 
you've likely seen your share of them. You may or 
may not have formal training, and while others 
might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive. 

D UELIST 

Fighting Style: Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack, 

Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte 
Feats: Defensive Duelist, Dual Wielder, Observant, 

Savage Attacker, Weapon Master 

You  regard the duel as a proud tradition, a test of 
skill and wits that brings honor to those who can de­
feat an enemy while respecting the art. Your search 
for improvement is a consuming passion, and you 
draw on the  expertise of the masters who've come 
before you as you work to perfect your form. 

GLADIATOR 

Fighting Style:  Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Goading Attack, Menacing Attack, 

Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack 

Feats: Athlete, Charger,  Dual Wielder, Durable, 

Grappler, Savage Attacker, Tough, Weapon Master 

You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport 
or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use 
all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adver­
saries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know 
how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.

HOPLITE 

Fighting Style: Defense, Thrown Weapon Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Brace,* Lunging Attack, Parry,  Preci­

sion Attack 

Feats: Athlete, Grappler, Polearm Master, Sentinel, 

Shield Master 

With spear and shield, you follow in the footsteps of 
the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and 
athle.ticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether 
fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squar­
ing off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task. 

LANCER 

Fighting Style: Dueling 
Maneuvers: Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Pre­

cision Attack, Pushing Attack 

Feats: Heavy Armor Master,  Mounted Combatant, 

Savage Attacker 

When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You 
ride  out to greet your enemy with the  point of your 
weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and 
only the heaviest blows can deter you. 

OUTRIDER 

Fighting Style: Archery 
Maneuvers: Ambush,* Distracting Strike, Goading 

Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss* 

Feats: Alert, Crossbow Expert, Mounted Combat-

ant, Observant, Sharpshooter 

You  find freedom in the saddle and a companion 
in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a 
blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and 
range, opting to find advantageous positions that al­
low you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading 
the most dangerous threats. 

PUGILIST 

Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, 
Grappling Strike,* Menacing Attack,  Pushing At­
tack, Riposte, Trip  Attack 

Feats: Athlete, Durable, Grappler, Savage Attacker, 

Tavern Brawler 

Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists. 
Whether through training or experience, you've 
developed a superior technique that can help you 
overcome an enemy in an up-close fight. 

SHOCK TROOPER 

Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting 
Maneuvers: Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, 

Sweeping Attack 

Feats: Charger, Great Weapon M aster, Heavy 

Armor Master 

S ... OCK  TR O O P E R

Subtlety is not your style. You're trained to get 
straight into the fighting, busting through enemy 
lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. 
Those who  ignore you in  combat do so at their peril. 

SKIRMISHER 

Fighting Style: Archery, Thrown Weapon Fighting* 
Maneuvers: Ambush,* Bait and Switch,* Distracting 

Strike, Quick Toss* 

Feats: Alert, Dual Wielder, Mobile, Skulker 

You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your 
mobility and versatility in combat to soften your ad­
versaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's 
plan rarely survives contact with you. 

STRATEGIST 

Fighting Style: Defense 
Maneuvers: Commander's Strike, Commanding 
Presence,* Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical 
Assessment* 

Feats: Inspiring Leader, Keen Mind, Linguist 

To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You un­
derstand that strength and speed are important in 
a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know 
how best to apply them. That's where you come in.

MONK 

The monk class receives new features and sub­
classes. in this section. 

O PTIONAL  C LA S S  FEATUR E S  

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a monk. Unlike the features in the Player's Hand­
book, you don't gain the  features here automatically. 
Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to 
gain a feature in this section if you meet the level re­
quirement noted in the feature's description. These 
features can be selected separately from one an­
other; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

DEDICATED  WEAPON 

2nd-level monk feature 

You  train yourself to use a variety of weapons as 
monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and 
shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long 
rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, 
and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until 
you use this feature again. 

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria: 

•  The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon. 
•  You must be proficient with it. 
•  It must lack the heavy and special properties. 

KI- FUELED ATTACK 

3rd-level monk feature 

If you spend  1  ki point or more as part of your action 
on your turn, you can make one attack with an un­
armed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action 
before the end of the turn. 

U ICKENED  HEALING 

4th-level monk feature 

As  an  action, you  can spend 2  ki  points and roll 
a Martial Arts die. You regain a number of hit 
points equal to the number rolled plus your profi­
ciency bonus. 

FOCUSED  AIM 

5th-level monk feature 

When you  miss with an  attack roll, you  can spend 
1  to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for 
each of these ki points you spend, potentially turn­
ing the miss into a hit. 

MONASTIC TRADITIONS 

At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition 
feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. 
The following options are available to you when 
making that choice: Way of Mercy or Way of the 
Astral Self. 

WAY  OF MERCY 

PIA�IAe tAocfor-\oMe look\ �ever �o 01At  of  1t�le." 

TASHA 

Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate 
the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. 
They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. 
However, to those beyond their help, they bring a 
swift end as an act of mercy. 

Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be 
members of a religious order,  administering to the 
needy and making grim choices rooted in reality 
rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced 
healers, beloved by their communities, while  others 
might be masked bringers of macabre mercies. 

The walkers of this way usually don robes with 
deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with 
masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bring­
ers of life and death. 

I M PLEME NTS OF M E RCY 
3rd-level Way of Mercy feature 

You gain  proficiency in the Insight and Medi­
cine skills, and you gain proficiency with the 
herbalism kit. 

You also gain _a special mask, which you often 
wear when using the features of this subclass. You 
determine its appearance, or generate it randomly 
by rolling on the Merciful Mask table.

You can use this feature only once per turn. 

PHYSIC IAN'S  TOUCH

6th-leve
.

You can administer even greater cures with a touch, 
and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you 

can  also end one disease or one of the following 
conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, 
paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. 

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you 
can subject that creature to the poisoned condition 
until the end of your next turn. 

FLU RRY OF H EALING A N D  HARM 
1 1th-level Way of Mercy feature 

You  can  now mete out  a flurry of comfort and hurt. 
When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace 
each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your 
Hand of Healing, without spending ki points for 
the  healing. 

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike 
with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm 
with that strike without spending the ki point for 
Hand of Harm. You can still use  Hand of Harm only 
once per turn. 

HAND OF ULTIMATE M E RCY 
17th-level Way of Mercy feature 

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the 
ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the 
corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 
hours and expend 5 ki points. The creature then re­
turns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal 
to 4d 10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died 
while subject to any of the following conditions, it 
revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, para­
lyzed, poisoned, and stunned. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 

until you finish a long rest. 

WAY  OF THE ASTRAL  SELF 

Note to  \elf:  cre1Ate  IA  lpell  th1At  let1  �olA  thro1At-p1A�ch 
people with �OIAY ,ho1t. 

A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self be­
lieves their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a 
representation of their true form, an astral self. This 
astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or 
disorder, with some monasteries training students 
to use their power to protect the weak and other 
instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true 
selves in service to the mighty. 

ARMS  OF  THE ASTRAL SELF 
3rd-level Way  of the Astral Self feature 

Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a 
portion of your astral self. As a bonus action, you 
can spend  1  ki point to summon the  arms of your 
astral self. When you do so, each creature of your 
choice  that you  can see within  10  feet of you must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take force 
damage  equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. 
For  10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near 
your shoulders or surround your arms (your choice). 
You determine the arms' appearance, and they van­
ish early if you are incapacitated or die. 

While the spectral arms are present, you gain the 

following benefits: 

•  You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of 
your Strength modifier when making Strength 
checks and Strength saving throws. 

•  You can use the spectral arms to make un­

armed strikes. 

•  When you make an unarmed strike with the arms 

on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater 
than normal. 

•  The unarmed strikes you make with the arms 
can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your 
Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and 
damage rolls, and their damage type is force. 

VI SAGE  OF T H E  ASTRAL SELF 
6th-level Way of the Astral Self feature 

You can summon the visage of your astral self. As a 
bonus action, or as part of the  bonus  action you take 
to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 
1  ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It 
vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die. 

The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet 

or mask. You determine its appearance.

FOR M S  O F  YOU R  ASTRAL SELF 
T h e  astral self is a tra n s lucent e m bodiment o f  the 
monk's sou l .  As a  res u lt, a n  astral self can reflect 
aspects of a  monk's backgro u n d ,  ideals, flaws, and 
bonds, a n d  a n  astral self doesn't necessarily look a ny­
thing l i ke the monk. For exam ple, the astral  self of a 
l a n ky h u m a n  m i ght be  rem i n i scent of a  m ino taur-the 
strength of which the monk feels within. S i m i l a rly, a n  
ore m o n k  m ight man ifest gossamer a r m s  and a deli­
cate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the ore's 
soul.  Each  astral  self is u n i q u e ,  a n d  some of the monks 
of this monastic trad ition are known more for the 
a p pearance of thei r astral self than for the i r  physical 
a p pearance. 

When choosi ng this path, consider the q u i rks that 
define you r  monk. Are you obsessed with something? 
Are you d riven by j u stice or a  selfish desire ?  Any of 
these motivations cou l d  m a n ifest i n  the form of you r  
astral self. 

Armor ofthe Spirit.  You gain a +2  bonus to 

Armor Class. 

Astral Barrage. Whenever you use the Extra At­
tack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack 
three times if all the attacks are made with your 
astral arms. 

While the spectral visage  is present, you  gain the 

following benefits. 

Astral Sight. You can see normally in dark­

ness, both magical  and  nonmagical, to a distance 
of 120 feet. 

Wisdom of the· Spirit.  You have advantage 
on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimida­
tion) checks. 

Word of the Spirit.  When you speak, you can di­
rect y9ur words to a creature of your choice that you 
can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that 
creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can am­
plify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet 
can hear you. 

BODY  OF THE ASTRAL SELF 
1 1th-level Way of the Astral Self feature 

When you  have both your astral arms and visage 
summoned, you can cause the body of your astral 
self to appear (no action required). This spectral 
body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, 
connecting with the arms and visage. You deter­
mine its appearance. 

While the spectral body is present, you gain the 

following benefits. 

Deflect Energy.  When you take acid, cold, fire, 
force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use 
your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the 
damage you take is reduced by ldlO + your Wisdom 
modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

Empowered Arms.  Once on each of your turns 

when you hit a target with the Arms of the As­
tral Self, you can deal extra damage to the 
target equal to your Martial Arts die. 

AWAKENED ASTRAL SELF 
1 7th-level Way of the Astral Self 
feature 

Your connection to your astral self 
is complete, allowing you to un­
leash its full potential. As a bonus 
action, you can spend 5 ki points to 
summon the arms, visage, and body 
of your astral self and awaken it for 
10 minutes. This awakening ends 
early if you are incapacitated or die. 

While your astral self is awakened, 

you gain the following benefits.

PALADIN 

The paladin class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIONA L  C LA S S  FEATU R E S  

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels  in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a paladin. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically.  Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description. 
These features can be selected separately from one 
another; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

ADDITIONAL  PALADIN  SPELLS 

----

2nd-level paladin feature 

The spells in  the following list expand the paladin 
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is orga-

nized by spell level, not character level. Each spell is 
in the Player's Handbook, unless it has an asterisk 
(a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide to Every­
thing also offers more spells.

FIGHTING  STYLE  OPTIONS 

2nd-level paladin  feature 

When you choose a fighting style,  the following 
styles are added to your list of options. 

BLESSED WARRIOR 
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the 
cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, 
and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. 
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can 
replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip 
from the cleric spell list. 

BLIND FIGHTING 
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within 
that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't 
behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in dark­
ness. Moreover, you can  see  an  invisible creature 
within that range, unless the creature successfully 
hides from you. 

-
I NTERCEPTION 
When a creature you can see hits a target, other 
than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can 
use your reaction to reduce the damage the target 
takes by  ldlO + your proficiency bonus (to a mini­
mum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or 
a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction. 

H ARNESS  DIVINE  POWER 

3rd-level paladin feature 

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity 
to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch 
your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one 
expended spell slot, the level of which can be no 
higher than  half your proficiency bonus (rounded 
up). The number of times you can use this feature is 
based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd 
level, once; 7th level, twice; and  1 5th level, thrice. 
You regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest. 

MARTIAL VERSATILITY 

4th-level paladin feature 

Whenever you reach a level  in this class  that  grants 
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can re­
place a fighting style you know with another fighting 
style available to paladins. This replacement rep­
resents a shift of focus in your martial practice. 

SAC R E D   OAT H S  

At 3rd level, a paladin gains the Sacred Oath fea­
ture, which offers you the choice of a subclass. The 
following options are available to you when making 
that choice: Oath of Glory and Oath of the Watchers.

TA�HA 

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they 
and their companions are destined to achieve glory 
through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and 
encourage their companions so they're all ready 
when destiny calls. 

TE N ETS  OF GLORY 
The  tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to at­
tempt heroics that might one day shine in legend. 

Actions over  Words.  Strive to be known by glori­

ous deeds, not words. 

T1 E F L I N G 

PALA D I N  O F  G L O RY 

ChaJJenges Are but Tests.  Face hardships 
with courage, and encourage your allies to face 
them with you. 

Hone  the Body. Like raw stone, your body must 

be worked so its potential can be realized. 

Discipline the Soul. You must marshal the dis­

cipline to overcome failings within yourself that 
threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends. 

OATH  SPE LLS 
3rd-level Oath of Glory feature 

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in

LIVING LEGEND 
20th-level Oath of Glory feature 

You gain the following two Channel Divinity op­
tions. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how 
Channel Divinity works. 

Peerless Athlete.  As a bonus action, you can 
use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleti­
cism. For the next  10 minutes, you have advantage 
on Strength (Athletics) and  Dexterity (Acrobatics) 
checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice  as 
much weight as normal; and the distance of your 
long and high jumps increases by  10 feet (this extra 
distance costs movement as normal). 

Inspiring  Smite.  Immediately after you deal dam­

age to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, 
you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action 
and distribute temporary hit points to creatures 
of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can in­
clude you. The total number of temporary hit points 
equals  2d8 + your level in this class, divided among 
the chosen creatures however you like. 

AURA OF ALACRITY 
7th-level Oath of Glory feature 

You emanate an aura that fills you and your com­
panions with supernatural speed, allowing you to 
race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking 
speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't 
incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who 
starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by  10 
feet until the end of that turn. 

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range 

of the aura increases to  10 feet. 

GLORIOUS DEFENSE 
15th-level Oath of Glory feature 

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When 
you or another creature you can see within  10 feet 
of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your re­
action to grant a bonus to the target's AC against 
that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus 
equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +l). If 
the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack 
against the attacker as part of this reaction, pro­
vided the attacker is within your weapon's range. 

You  can use this feature a number of times equal 
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and 
you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest. 

You  can  empower yourself with the  legends­
whether true or exaggerated-of your great deeds. 
As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits 
for  1  minute: 

•  You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, 

gaining advantage on all Charisma checks. 
•  Once on each of your turns when you make a 

weapon  attack and miss, you can  cause  that attack 
to hit instead. 
If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reac­
tion to reroll it. You must use this new roll. 

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it 
again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 
a 5th-level spell slot to use it again. 

OATH OF THE WATCHERS

TASHA 

The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect 
mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar 
creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal 
soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spir­
its, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against 
such threats. 

Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever 

vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar 
forces, often establishing a network of spies and 
informants to gather information on suspected 
cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and 
awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as 
wearing armor in battle. 

TENETS OF THE WATCH ERS 
A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers 
swears to safeguard mortal realms from other­
worldly threats. 

Vigilance. The threats you face are cunning, 
powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their 
corruption. 

Loyalty.  Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or 

those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, 
your comrades, and your duty. 

Discipline. You are the shield against the endless 
terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be 
forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what 
lies beyond.

Divinity works. 

Watcher's  Will.  You can use your Channel Divin­
ity to invest your presence with the warding power 
of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number 
of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up 
to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (min­
imum of one creature). For 1  minute, you and the 
chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. 

Abjure the Extraplanar. You can use your Chan­

nel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an 
action, you present your holy symbol and each 
aberration, celestial, elemental, fey,  or fiend within 
30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wis­
dom saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature is 
turned for  1  minute or until it takes damage. 

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to 

move as far away from you as it can, and  it can't 
willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of 
you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action 
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from 
moving.  If there's nowhere to move,  the creature can 
take the Dodge action. 

AURA OF THE SENTI N E L  
7th-level Oath of the  Watchers feature 

You  emit an aura of alertness while you aren't in­
capacitated. When you and any creatures of your 
choice within  10 feet of you roll initiative, you 
all gain a bonus to initiative equal to your profi­
ciency bonus. 

. 

At  1 8th level, the range of this aura increases 

to 30 feet.

You've learned how to chastise anyone who dares 
wield beguilements against you and your wards. 
Whenever you or a creature you can see within 30 
feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, a Wisdom, 
or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your re­
action to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force 
damage to the creature that forced  the saving throw. 

MORTA L BULWARK 
20th-level Oath of the  Watchers feature 

You manifest a spark of divine power in defense of 
the mortal realms. As a bonus action, you gain the 
following benefits for 1  minute: 

•  You gain truesight with a range of 1 20 feet. 
•  You have advantage on attack rolls against aberra­

tions, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends. 
•  When you hit a creature with an attack roll and 
deal damage to it, you can also force it to make 
a Charisma saving throw against your spell save 
DC. On a failed save,  the creature is magically 
banished to its native plane of existence if it's cur­
rently not there. On a successful save, the creature 
can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours. 

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it 
again  until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 
a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.

when you reach certain levels  in your class. This

Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level

qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

Explorer feature 

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both 
in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your 
travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you

when you finish a long rest. 

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your 

exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1 .  

FAVORED  FOE 

1st-level ranger feature,  which replaces the Favored 
Enemy feature and works with  the Foe Slayer 
feature 

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can 
call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the 
target as your favored enemy for 1  minute or until 
you lose your concentration (as if you were concen­
trating on a spell). 

The first time on each of your turns that you hit 

the favored enemy and deal damage to it, includ­
ing when you mark it, you can increase that dam­
age by 1d4. 

You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy 
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, 
and you regain all expended uses when you finish a 
long rest.

3rd-level Fey  Wanderer feature 

Your fey qualities give you a supernatural charm. 
As a result, whenever you make a Charisma check, 
you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom 
modifier (minimum of +l). 

In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the 
following skills of your choice: Deception, Perfor­
mance, or Persuasion. 

BEGU I LING TWI ST 
7th-level Fey  Wanderer feature 

The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You 
have  advantage on  saving throws against being 
charmed or frightened. 

In addition, whenever you or a creature you can 

see within 1 2 0  feet of you succeeds on a saving 
throw against being charmed or frightened, you can 
use your reaction to force a different creature you 
can see within  1 20 feet of you to make a Wisdom 
saving throw against your spell save DC. If the save 
fails, the target is charmed or frightened by you 
(your choice) for 1  minute. The target can repeat the 
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending 
the effect on itself on a successful save. 

FEY REI N FORC E M E NTS 
11th-level Fey  Wanderer feature 

The  royal courts of the  Feywild have  blessed you 
with the  assistance of fey beings: you  know summon 
fey  (a  spell in chapter 3). It doesn't count against the 
number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast 
it without a material  component. You can also cast it 
once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability 
to do so when you finish a long rest. 

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can 
modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If 
you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1  minute for 
that casting. 

M I STY WAN DERER 
15th-level Fey  Wanderer feature 

You  can  slip in and out  of the  Feywild to move in 
a blink of an eye: you can cast misty step without 
expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of 
times  equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 
once),  and you regain all expended uses when you 
finish a long rest. 

In addition, whenever you cast misty step, you can 
bring along one willing creature you can see within 
5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccu­
pied space of your choice within 5 feet of your desti­

TASHA 

Feeling a deep connection to the environment 
around them, some rangers reach out through their 
magical connection to the world and bond with a 
swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a po­
tent force  in battle, as well as helpful company for 
the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or 
hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant 
swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of 
others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant 
communities that work for the mutual benefit of all 
those they consider part of their swarm.

GATHERED SWARM 
3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature 

A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded 
itself to you and can assist you in battle. Until you 
die, the  swarm  remains in your space, crawling on 
you or flying and skittering around you within your 
space. You determine its appearance, or you gener­
ate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appear­
ance table.

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the 
swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, 
immediately after you hit a creature with an attack: 

•  The attack's target takes  ld6 piercing damage 

from the swarm . 

•  The attack's target must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw against your spell save DC or be 
moved by the swarm up to  15  feet horizontally in a 
direction of your choice. 

•  You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in 

a direction of your choice. 

SWARMKEEPER MAGIC 
3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature 

You learn the mage hand cantrip if you don't already 
know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form 
of your swarming nature spirits. 

You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or 
higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as 
shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell 
counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count 
against the number of ranger spells you know.

7th-level Swarmkeeper feature 

You can condense part of your swarm into a focused 
mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain 
a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect 
lasts for  1  minute or until you are incapacitated. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal

•  If a creature fails its saving throw against being 
moved by Gathered Swarm, you can also cause 
the swarm to knock the creature prone. 

•  When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives 

you  half cover until the start of your next turn. 

SWARMING D I SPERSAL 
15th-level Swarmkeeper feature 

You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding 
danger. When you take damage, you can use your 
reaction to give yourself resistance to that damage. 
You vanish into your swarm and then teleport to an 
unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of 
you, where you reappear with the swarm. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal

BEAST MAST E R  C OMPAN IONS 

The Beast Master i n  the Player's Handbook forms 
a mystical bond with an animal. As an alternative, 
a Beast Master can take the feature below to form a 
bond with a special primal beast instead. 

PRIMAL C O M PA NION 
3rd-level Beast Master feature,  which replaces the 
Ranger's Companion feature 

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws 
strength from your bond with nature. The beast 
is friendly to you and your companions and obeys 
your commands. Choose  its stat block-Beast of the 
Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky-which 
uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. 
You also determine the kind of animal the beast 
is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. 
Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal 
markings, indicating its mystical origin. 

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can 

move and use its reaction on its own, but the only 
action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take 
a bonus action on your turn to command it to take 
another action. That action can be one in its stat 
block or some other action. You can also sacrifice 
one of your attacks when you take the Attack action 
to command the beast to take the Attack action. If 
you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action 
of its choice, not just Dodge. 

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can 
use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of

TASHA  · 

Many rogues walk a fine  line between life and 
death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of 
others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues 
discover a mystical connection to death itself. These 
rogues take knowledge from the dead and become 
immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming 
like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly ef­
fective information gatherers and spies. 

Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters 
of these macabre techniques, and some are willing 
to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgot­
ten Realms and  Karrnath in Eberron, where many 
necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can 
become a wizard's confidant and right hand.  In tem­
ples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as 
an agent to track down those who try to cheat death 
and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be 
lost to the grave. 

How did you discover this grim power? Did 
you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new 
abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or 
thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death? 

WH ISPERS  OF THE DEAD 
3rd-level Phantom feature 

Echoes of those who  have  died cling to you. When­
ever you finish a short or long rest, you can choose 
one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain 
it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with 
you. You lose this proficiency when you use this fea­
ture to choose a different proficiency that you lack. 

WAI LS  FROM THE GRAVE 
3rd-level Phantom feature 

As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can 
channel the power of death to harm someone else 
as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak 
Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can 
target a second creature that you can see within 
30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of 
Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the 
second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the 

roll's total, as wails of the  dead  sound  around them 
for a moment. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses when you finish a long rest. 

TOKENS OF THE D E PARTED 
9th-level Phantom feature 

When a life ends in your presence, you're able to 
snatc\1 a token from the  departing soul, a sliver of 
its life essence that takes physical form: as a reac­
tion when a creature you can see dies within  30 
feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause 
a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket.  The 
DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll 
on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to 
generate it. 

You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets 
equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create 
one while at your maximum. 

You can use soul trinkets in the following ways: 

•  While a soul trinket is on your person, you have 
advantage  on death saving throws and Constitu­
tion saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by 
the life essence within the object. 

•  When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your 
turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets 
that's on your person and then immediately use 
Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of 
that feature. 

•  As an action, you can destroy one of your soul 

trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you 
do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the 
trinket one question. The spirit appears to you 
and answers in a language it knew in life. It's un­
der no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as 
concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit 
knows only what it knew in life, as determined 
by the DM. 

GHOST WALK 
13th-level Phantom feature 

You can phase partially into the realm of the  dead, 
becoming like a ghost. As a bonus action, you as­
sume a spectral form. While in this form, you have 
a flying speed of 10 feet, you  can hover, and attack 
rolls have disadvantage against you. You  can also 
move through creatures and objects as if they were 
difficult terrain, but you take  ldlO force damage if 
you end your turn inside a creature or an object. 

You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you 
end it as a bonus action. To use this feature again, 
you must finish a long rest or destroy one of your 
soul trinkets as part of the bonus action you use to 
activate Ghost Walk. 

D EATH 'S  FRIEND 
1 7th-level Phantom feature 

Your association with death has become so close 
that you gain the following benefits: 

•  When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can 
deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the 
second creature. 

•  At the end of a long rest, a soul trinket appears in 
your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as 
the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.

Most assassins strike with physical weapons, 
and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to 
infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulk­
nife strikes and infiltrates with  the mind, cutting 
through barriers both physical and psychic. These 
rogues discover psionic power within themselves 
and channel it to do their roguish work. They find 
easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, 

C H A P T E R  1  I  C H A RACTER O P T I O N S

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy 
die they use, as specified in a power's description, 
and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a 
die when your dice are all expended. You regain all 
your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish 
a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can 
regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you 
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 
When you reach certain levels in this class, the 
size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th 
level (d8), 1 1th level (d l O), and  17th level (d1 2). 

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice. 
Psi-Bolstered Knack. When your nonpsionic 
training fails you, your psionic power can help: if 
you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with 
which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic 
Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, 
potentially turning failure into success. You expend 
the die only if the roll succeeds. 

Psychic  Whispers. You can establish telepathic 
communication between yourself and others-per­
fect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one 
or more creatures you can see, up to a  number of 
creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then 
roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours 
equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures 
can speak telepathically with you, and you can 
speak telepathically with them. To send or receive 
a message (no action required), you and the other 
creature must be within  1  mile of each other. A crea­
ture can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any lan­
guages, and a creature can end the telepathic con­
nection at any time (no action required). You and the 
creature don't need to speak a common language to 
understand each other. 

The first time you use this power after each long 

rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All 
other times you use the power, you expend the die. 

PSYC H I C  BLADES 
3rd-level Soulknife feature 

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmer­
ing blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take 
the Attack action, you can manifest a psychic blade 
from your free hand and make the attack with that 
blade. This magic blade is a simple melee weapon 
with the finesse and thrown properties. It has a nor­
. ma! range of 60 feet and no long range, and on a hit, 
it deals psychic damage equal to  ld6 plus the ability 
modifier you used for the attack roll. The blade van­
ishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, 
and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage. 

After you attack with the blade, you can make 
a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second 

though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are 
leery of anyone using strange mind powers to con­
duct their business. Most governments would also 
be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy. 

Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material 

Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk 
the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal 
guardians of their woods. In the endless war among 
the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a 
Soulknife when stealth is required against the 
githyanki foe. 

As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have 
haunted you since you were a child, only revealing 
their full potential as you experienced the stress of 
adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive 
order of psychic adepts and spent years learning 
how to manifest your power. 

PSIONIC POWER 
3rd-level Soulknife feature 

You  harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within 
yourself. This· energy is represented by your Psionic 
Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a num­
ber of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bo­
nus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, 
which are detailed below.

SOUL BLADES · 
9th-level Soulknife feature 

Your Psychic Blades are  now an  expression of your 
psi-suffused soul,  giving you these powers that use 
your Psionic Energy dice: 

Homing Strikes.  If you make an attack roll with 

your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can 
roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number 
rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to 
hit, you expend the Psionic Energy die. 

Psychic  Teleportation.  As a bonus action, you 
manifest one of your Psychic Blades, expend  one 
Psionic Energy die and roll it, and throw the blade at 
an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of 
feet away equal to  10 times the number rolled. You 
then teleport to that space, and  the blade vanishes. 

PSYCHIC VEI L  
13th-level Soulknife feature 

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask 
yourself. As an action, you can magically become 
invisible, along with anything you are wearing or 
carrying, for  1  hour or until you dismiss this effect 
(no action required). This invisibility ends early im­
mediately after you deal damage to a creature or you 
force a creature to make a saving throw. 

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again 

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
Psionic Energy die to use this feature again. 

REND M I N D  
17th-level Soulknife feature 

You can sweep your Psychic Blades directly through 
a creature's mind. When you use your Psychic 
Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, 
you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving 
throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Dexterity modifier). If the save fails, the target 
is stunned for 1  minute. The stunned target can re­
peat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. 

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend three 
Psionic Energy dice to use it again.

At  1 st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin

The following options are available to you when 
making that choice: the Aberrant Mind and the 
Clockwork Soul.

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around 
your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now 
touch other minds with that power and alter the 
world around you by using it to control the magical 
energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from 
you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a 
source of terror to those who feel the stab of your 
mind  and witness the strange manifestations of 
your might?

METAMAGIC  OPTIONS 

3rd-level sorcerer feature 

When you choose  Metamagic options, you have ac­
cess to the following additional options. 

SEEKING  SPELL 
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you 
can  spend  2  sorcery points to reroll  the d20, and 
you must use the new roll. 

You can use Seeking Spell even if you have al­
ready used a different Metamagic option during the 
casting of the spell. 

TRANSM UTED  S PELL 
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage 
from the following list, you can spend  1  sorcery 
point to change that damage type to one of the 
other listed types:  acid,  cold,  fire, lightning, poi­
son, thunder. 

SORCEROUS  VERSATILITY 

4th-level sorcerer feature 

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants 
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do 
one of the following, representing the magic within 
you flowing in new ways: 

•  Replace one of the  options you chose for the 

Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic op­
tion available to you. 

•  Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's 

Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the 
sorcerer spell list. 

MAGICAL  GUIDANCE 

5th-level sorcerer feature 

You can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to 
try to conjure success from failure. When you make 
an ability check that fails, you can spend  1 
sorcery point to reroll  the d20, and you must 
use the new roll, potentially turning the fail-
ure into a success.

acquired your powers. Were you born with them? 
Or did an event later in life leave you  shining with 
psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins

You learn additional spells when you reach certain 
levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells 
table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell 
for you, but it doesn't count against the number of 
sorcerer spells you know. 

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can re­
place one spell you gained from this feature with 
another spell of the same level. The new spell must 
be a divination or an enchantment spell from the

TELEPATHIC SPEECH 
1st-level Aberrant Mind feature 

You can form a telepathic connection between your 
mind and the mind of another. As a bonus action, 
choose one creature you can see within 30 feet 
of you. You and the chosen creature can speak 
telepathically with each other while the two of you 
are within a number of miles of each other equal to 
your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1  mile). To un­
derstand each other, you each must speak mentally 
in a language the other knows. 

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of 
minutes equal to your sorcerer level. It ends early if 
you are incapacitated or die or if you use this ability 
to form a connection with a different creature.

PSIONIC SORCERY 
6th-level Aberrant Mind feature 

When you cast any spell of 1 st level or higher from 
your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by ex­
pending a spell sl()t as normal or by spending a 
number of sorcery points equal to the  spell's level. 
If you cast the spell using sorcery points, it requires 
no verbal or somatic components, and it requires no 
material components, unless they are consumed by 
the spell. 

PSYCHIC D EFENSES 
6th-level Aberrant Mind feature 

You gain resistance to psychic damage, and you 
have advantage on saving throws against being 
charmed or frightened. 

REVELATION I N  FLESH 
14th-level Aberrant Mind feature 

You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within 
yourself. As a bonus action, you can spend 1  or 
more sorcery points to magically transform your 
body for  10 minutes. For each sorcery point you 
spend, you can  gain one of the following benefits of 
your choice, the effects of which last until the trans­
formation ends: 

•  You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet 
of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your 
eyes also turn black or become writhing sen­
sory tendrils. 

•  You gain a flying speed equal to your walking 
speed, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin 
glistens with mucus or shines with an other­
worldly light. 

•  You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your 
walking speed, and you can breathe underwa­
ter. Moreover, gills grow from your neck or fan 
out from behind your ears, your fingers become 
webbed, or you grow writhing cilia that extend 
through your clothing. 

•  Your body, along with any equipment you are 

wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. 
You can move through any space as narrow as 
1  inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 
feet of movement to escape from nonmagical re­
straints or being grappled. 

WARPING IM PLOSION 
18th-level Aberrant Mind feature 

You  can  unleash yqur aberrant power as a 
space-warping anomaly. As an action, you can tele­
port to an unoccupied space you can see within  120 
feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each 
creature within 30 feet of the space you left must 
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled 

68 

C H A PT E R  1  I  C H A R AC T E R  O PT I O N S  

straight toward the space you left, ending in an 
unoccupied space as close to your former space as 
possible. On a successful save, the creature takes 
half as much damage and isn't pulled. 

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again 
until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sor­
cery points to use it again.

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with 
magic. That power arises from  Mechanus or a 
realm like it-a plane of existence shaped entirely by 
clockwork efficiency. You, or someone from your lin­
eage, might have become entangled in the machina­
tions of the modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit 
Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in 
the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within 
you, the power of order can seem strange to others, 
but for you, it is part of a vast and glorious system. 

CLOCKWORK MAGIC 
1st-level Clockwork Soul feature 

You learn additional spells when you reach certain 
levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork 
Spells  table.  Each of these spells counts as a sor­
cerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the 
number of sorcerer spells you know. 

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can re­
place one spell you gained from this feature with 
another spell of the same level. The new spell must 
be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the 
sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.

RESTORE BALANCE 
1st-level Clockwork Soul feature 

Your connection to the  plane of absolute order al­
lows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a crea­
ture you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll 
a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use 
your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected 
by advantage and disadvantage. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended uses  when you finish a long rest. 

BASTION OF LAW 
6th-level Clockwork Soul feature 

You can tap  into the grand equation of existence to 
imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. 
As an action, you can expend  1  to 5 sorcery points 
to create a magical ward around yourself or another 
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The ward 
lasts until you  finish a long rest or until you use this 
feature again. 

The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal 

to the number of sorcery points spent to create it. 
When the warded creature takes damage, it can ex­
pend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce 
the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice. 

TRANCE OF ORDER 
14th-level Clockwork Soul feature 

You  gain the ability to align your consciousness to 
the  endless calculations of Mechanus. As a bonus 
action, you can enter this state for 1  minute. For the 
duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from 
advantage, and whenever you make  an attack roll, 
an ability check, or a saving throw, you can treat a 
roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a  10. 

Once you

use .this bonus action, you can't use it

.

again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 
sorcery points to use it again.

C LOCKWORK CAVALCADE 
18th-level Clockwork Soul feature 

You summon spirits of order to expunge  disorder 
around you. As an action, you summon the spirits in 
a 30-foot cube originating from you. The spirits look 
like modrons or other constructs of your choice. 
The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they 
create the following effects within the cube before 
vanishing: 

•  The spirits restore up to  100 hit points, divided 

as you choose among any number of creatures of 
your choice in the cube. 

•  Any damaged objects entirely in the cube are re­

paired instantly. 

•  Every spell of 6th level or lower ends on creatures 

and objects of your choice in the cube. 

Once you use this action, you can't use it again un­
til you finish a long rest, unless you spend 7 sorcery 
points to use it again.

The warlock class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIONA L  C LA S S  FEATUR E S  

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook 
when you reach certain levels  in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a warlock. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically.  Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description. 
These features can be selected separately from one 
another; you can use some, all, or none of them. 

ADDITIONAL WARLOCK SPELLS 

1st-level warlock feature 

The spells in the following list expand the warlock 
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is orga­
nized by spell level, not character level. Each spell is

PACT BOON  OPTION 

3rd-level warlock feature 

When you choose your Pact Boon feature, the fol­
lowing option is available to you. 

PACT OF THE TALISMAN 
Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that 
can aid the wearer when the need is great. When 
the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 
to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. 
This benefit can be used a number of times equal to 
your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are 
restored when you finish a long rest. 

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a  1-hour 

ceremony to receive a replacement from your pa­
tron. This ceremony can be performed during a 
short or long rest,  and it destroys the previous amu­
let. The talisman turns to ash when you die. 

ELDRITCH VERSATILITY 

4th-level warlock feature 

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants 
the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do 
one of the following, representing a change of focus 
in your occult studies: 

•  Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's 
Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the 
warlock spell list. 

•  Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon 
feature with one of that feature's other options. 
•  If you're  1 2th level or higher, replace one spell 

from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another 
warlock spell of the same level. 

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your 
Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them 
now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

When any creature whose name is on the page 
is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, 
the creature magically drops to  1  hit point instead. 
Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit 
from it until you finish a long rest. 

As an action, you can magically erase a name on

You have plunged into a pact with the deeps. An 
entity of the ocean, the Elemental Plane of Water,

cosmic floodgates and drown the world?

TENTACLE OF THE DEEPS 
1st-level Fathomless feature 

You can magically summon a spectral tentacle that 
strikes at your foes. As a bonus action, you create a 
10-foot-long tentacle at a point you can see within 
60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for  1  minute or un­
til you use this feature to create another tentacle. 

When you create the tentacle, you can make a me­
lee spell attack against one creature within  10 feet 
of it. On a hit, the target takes  ld8 cold damage, and 
its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the. start of your 
next turn. When you reach  1 0th level in this class, 
the damage increases to 2d8. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the 

tentacle up to 30 feet and repeat the attack. 

You can summon the tentacle a number of times 
equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all 
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

You are  now even  more  at home in the depths. You

you are fully sub.merged, any creature that is also
fully submerged can understand your speech, and 
you can understand theirs. 

GUARDIAN COIL 
6th-level Fathomless feature 

Your Tentacle of the Deeps can defend you and 
others, interposing itself between them and harm. 
When you or a creature you can see takes damage 
while within  10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your 
reaction to choose one of those creatures and re­
duce the damage to that creature by  ld8. When you 
reach  1 0th level in this class, the damage reduced 
by the tentacle increases to 2d8. 

GRASPING TENTACLES 
10th-level Fathomless feature 

You learn the spell Evard's black tentacles. It counts 
as a warlock spell for you, but it doesn't count 
against the number of spells you know. You can also 
cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the 
ability to do so when you finish a long rest. 

Whenever you cast this spell, your patron's magic 

bolsters you, granting you a number of temporary 
hit points equal to your warlock level. Moreover, 
damage can't break your concentration on this spell. 

FATHOMLESS PLUNGE 
14th-level Fathomless feature 

You can magically open temporary conduits to 
watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport 
yourself and up to five other willing creatures that 
you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of 
tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to

You have made a pact with one of the rarest kinds 
of genie, a noble genie. Such entities rule vast fiefs 
on the Elemental Planes and have great influence 
over lesser genies and elemental creatures. Noble 
genies are varied in their motivations, but most are 
arrogant and wield power that rivals that of lesser 
deities. They delight in turn,ing the table on mortals, 
who often bind genies into servitude, and readily en­
ter into pacts that expand their reach. 

You choose your patron's kind or determine it ran­

domly, using the Genie  Kind table.

E XPANDED SPELL LIST 
1st-level Genie feature 

The Genie lets you choose from  an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Genie 
Expanded Spells table shows the genie spells that 
are added to the warlock spell list for you, along 
with the spells associated in the table with your pa­
tron's kind: dao, djinni, efreeti, or marid. 

GEN IE'S VES SEL 
1st-level Genie feature 

Your patron gifts you  a magical vessel that grants 
you a measure of the genie's power. The vessel is 
a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting 
focus for your warlock spells. You decide what the 
object is, or you can determine what it is randomly 
by rolling on the Genie's Vessel table.

While you are touching the vessel, you can use it 

in the following ways: 

Bottled Respite. As an action, you can magically 
vanish and enter your vessel, which remains 
in the space you left. The interior of the vessel 
is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 
20-foot-radius cylinder,  20 feet high, and resem­
bles your vessel. The interior is appointed with 
cushions and low tables and is a comfortable 
temperature. While inside, you can hear the area 
around your vessel as if you were in its space. You 

can remain inside the vessel up to a number of 
hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You 
exit the vessel early if you  use  a bonus action to 
leave, if you  die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When 
you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied 
space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel 
remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is 
destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly 
appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the 
vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, 
you can't enter again until you finish a long rest. 

Genie's Wrath. Once during each of your turns 

when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal ex­
tra damage to the target equal to your proficiency 
bonus. The type of this damage is determined by 
your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), 
.  fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). 

The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its 
hit points equal your warlock level plus your profi­
ciency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psy­
chic damage. 

74 

C H A P T E R  1  I  C H A R ACTER OPTIONS 

If the  vessel  is destroyed or you lose it, you can 
perform a  1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement 
from your patron. This ceremony can be performed 
during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel 
is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a 
flare of elemental power when you die. 

ELEMENTAL  GIFT 
6th-level Genie feature 

You begin to take on  characteristics of your patron's 
kind. You now have resistance to a damage type de­
termined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), 
thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid). 
In addition, as a bonus action, you can give 
yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 1 0  
minutes, during which you c a n  hover. You can use 
this bonus action a number of times equal to your 
proficiency bonus, and you regain all  expended uses 
when you finish a long rest. 

SANCTUARY VES SEL 
1 0th-level Genie feature 

When you enter your Genie's Vessel via the  Bot­
tled Respite feature, you can now choose up to five 
willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of 
you, and the chosen creatures are drawn into the 
vessel with you. 

As a bonus action, you can eject any number of 
creatures from the vessel, and everyone is ejected if 
you leave or die or if the vessel is destroyed. 

In addition, anyone (including you) who remains 
within the vessel for at least  10 minutes gains the 
benefit of finishing a short rest, and anyone can add 
your proficiency bonus to the number of hit points 
they regain if they spend any Hit Dice as part of a 
short rest there. 

LIMITED WIS H  
14th-level Genie feature 

You entreat your patron to grant you a small wish. 
As an action, you can speak your desire to your Ge­
nie's Vessel, requesting the effect of one spell that is 
6th level or lower and has a casting time of 1  action. 
The spell can be from any class's spell list, and you 
don't need to meet the requirements in that spell, 
including costly components; the spell simply takes 
effect as part of this action. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again 

until you finish  ld4 long rests.

WIZARD 

The wizard class receives new features and sub­
classes in this section. 

O PTIONAL C LA S S  FEATU R E S  

You gain class features in the Player's  Handbook 
when you reach certain levels in your class. This 
section offers additional features that you can gain 
as a wizard. Unlike the features in the Player's 
Handbook, you don't gain the features here automat­
ically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether 
to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level 
requirement noted in the feature's description. 
These features can be selected separately from one 
another; you can use some,  all, or none of them. 

ADDITIONAL WIZARD  SPELLS 

1st-level wizard feature 

The spells in the following list expand the wizard 
spell list in the Player's Handbook. The list is or­
ganized by spell level, not character level. A spell's 
school of magic is noted, and if a spell can be cast as 
a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. 
Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it has 
an asterisk (a spell in chapter 3). Xanathar's Guide 
to Everything also offers  more  spells.

CANTRIP  FORMULAS 

3rd-level wizard feature 

You have scribed a set of arcane formulas  in your 
spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip 
in your mind. Whenever you finish a long rest and 
consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can 
replace one wizard cantrip you know with another 
cantrip from the wizard spell list. 

ARC A N E  TRADITIONS 

At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition 
feature, which offers you the choice of a subclass. 
The following options are available to you when 
making that choice: Bladesinging and the Order 
of Scribes. 

BLADE SINGING

TASHA · 

Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that 
incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally cre­
ated by elves, this tradition has been adopted by 
non-elf practitioners, who  honor and expand on the 
elven ways. 

In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, 

elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow 
the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating 

attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have 
observed a bladesinger at work remember the 
display as one of the more beautiful experiences 
in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a 
singing blade. 

TRAINING  IN WAR AND SONG 
2nd-level Bladesinging feature 

You gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain 
proficiency with one type of one-handed melee 
weapon of your choice. 

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill 

if you don't already have it. 

BLADE SONG 
2nd-level Bladesinging feature 

You can invoke an elven magic called the 
Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing me­
dium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you 
with supernatural speed, agility, and focus. 

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, 

which lasts for 1  minute. It ends early if you are in­
capacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or 
a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack 
with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong 
at any time (no action required). 

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the fol­

lowing benefits: 

A  DROW  /\ N O /\  li l G H  

E L F   B L /\ D E S I N G E R  

•  You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelli­

gence modifier (minimum of +1). 

•  Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. 
•  You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobat­

ics) checks. 

•  You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw 

you make  to maintain your concentration on a 
spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier 
(minimum of + 1). 

You can use this feature a number of times equal 

to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all ex­
pended  uses of it when you finish a long rest. 

EXTRA ATTACK 
6th-level Bladesinging feature 

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever 
you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, 
you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of 
those attacks. 

SONG OF DEFENSE 
1 0th-level Bladesinging feature 

You can direct your magic to absorb damage while 
your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, 
you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot 
and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal 
to five times the spell slot's level. 

SONG OF VICTORY 
14th-level Bladesinging feature 

li U M /\ N  W l l./\ R O ,  

O R D E R   O F  S C R I B E S  

You  can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum 
of + 1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks 
while your Bladesong is active. 

WIZARDLY QUI LL 
2nd-level Order of Scribes feature 

ORDER  OF S CRIBES 

MA�ic  is  �reAt  Al-\IA All,  b1.1t hAve �01.1 smelleiA A  book? 

TASl/A 

Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wiz­
ardry. The name is apt, given how much time wiz­
ards spend poring over tomes and penning theories 
about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards 
traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from 
their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to 
plumb an archive  of ancient knowledge. 

Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most 

bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, 
but its primary mission is the same everywhere: 
recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can 
flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a 
wizard in the  Order of Scribes magically awakens 
their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All 
wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks 
to theirs! 

As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny 
quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the fol­
lowing properties: 

•  The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with 
it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the 
writing surface. 

•  The time you must spend to copy a spell into your 
spellbook equals 2  minutes per spell level if you 
use the quill for the transcription. 

•  You can erase anything you write with the quill if 
you wave the feather over the text as a bonus ac­
tion, provided the text is within 5 feet of you. 

This quill disappears if you create another one or 

if you die. 

AWAKENED SPELLBOOK 
2nd-level Order of Scribes feature 

Using specially prepared inks and ancient incan­
tations passed down by your wizardly order, you 
have awakened an arcane sentience within your 
spell book. 

While you are holding the book, it grants you the 

following benefits: 

C H A PT E R  l  I  C H A RACTER O P T I O N S

7 7  

•  You can  use the  book as a spellcasting focus for 

your wizard spells. 

•  When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, 

you can temporarily replace its damage type with 
a type that appears in another spell in your spell­
book, which magically alters the spell's formula 
for this casting only. The latter spell must be of the 
same level as the spell slot you expend. 

•  When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can 
use the spell's normal casting time, rather than 
adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, 
you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. 

If necessary, you can replace the book over the 
course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill 
to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic 
spell book to which you're attuned. At the end of the 
rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned 
into the new book, which the consciousness trans­
forms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. 
If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the 
spells vanish from its pages. 

MASTER SCRIVENER 
10th-level Order of Scribes feature 

Whenever you  finish a long rest, you  can create one 
magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a 
blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one 
spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied 
onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet 
of you when you make the scroll. 

The chosen spell must be of 1 st or 2nd level and 

must have a casting time of 1  action. Once in the 
scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as 
one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell 
from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll 
is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell van­
ishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you 
finish your next  long rest. 

You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which 

are described in the treasure chapter of the Dun­
geon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must 
spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use 
your Wizardly Quill. 

MANIFE ST MIND 
6th-level Order of Scribes feature 

ONE WITH THE WORD 
14th-level Order of Scribes feature 

Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has 
become so profound that your soul has become 
entwined with it. While the book is on your person, 
you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) 
checks, as the spellbook helps you remember 
magical lore. 

Moreover, if you take damage while your spell­
book's mind is manifested, you can prevent all of 
that damage to you by using your reaction to dis­
miss the spectral mind, using its magic to save your­
self. Then roll 3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses 
spells of your choice that have a combined spell 
level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the 
rail's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have 
a combined level of at least 9, which could  mean one 
9th-level spell, three 3rd-level spells, or some other 
combination. If there aren't enough spells in the 
book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points. 

Until you finish  ld6 long rests, you are incapable 
of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a 
scroll or in another spellbook. After you finish the 
required number of rests, the spells reappear in the 
spellbook. 

Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again 

until you finish a long rest. 

You can conjure forth the  mind of your Awakened 
Spellbook. As a bonus action while the book is on 
your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as 
a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied 
space of your choice within 60 feet of you. The spec­
tral mind is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, 
and it sheds dim light in a  1 0-foot radius. It looks 
like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar 
from the past (your choice). 

While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and 

see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. 
The mind can telepathically share with you what it 
sees and hears (no action required). 

Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, 
you can cast it as if you were in the spectral mind's 
space, instead of your own, using its senses. You 
can do so a number of times per day equal to your 
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses 
when you finish a long rest. 

As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral 
mind to hover up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space 
that you or it can see. It can pass through creatures 
but not objects. 

The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever 
more than 300 feet away from you, if someone casts 
dispel magic on it, if the Awakened Spellbook is 
destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral 
mind as a bonus action. 

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again 

until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 
spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

FIGHTING  INITIATE 

Prerequisite: Proficiency with a martial weapon 

Your martial training has  helped you develop a par­
ticular style of fighting. As a result, you learn one 
Fighting Style option of your choice from the fighter 
class. If you already have a style, the one you choose

SLASHER 

You've learned where to cut to have the greatest re­
sults, granting you the following benefits: 

•  Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a 

maximum of 20. 

•  Once per turn when you hit a creature with an 

attack that deals slashing damage, you can reduce 
the speed of the target by  10 feet until the start of 
you_r next turn. 

•  When you score a critical hit that deals slashing 
damage to a creature, you grievously wound it. 
Until the start of your next turn, the target has dis­
advantage on all attack rolls. 

TELEKINETIC 

You learn to move things with your mind, granting 
you the following benefits: 

•  Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 

score by  1, to a maximum of 20. 

•  You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it 
without verbal or somatic components, and you 
can make the spectral hand  invisible.  If you al­
ready know this spell, its range increases by 30 
feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the 
ability increased by this feat. 

•  As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically 

shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of 
you. When you do so, the target must succeed on 
a Strength  saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency 
bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased 
by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away 
from you. A creature can willingly fail this save. 

TELEPATHIC 

You awaken  the ability to mentally connect with oth­
ers, granting you the following benefits: 

•  Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 

score by  1, to a maximum of 20. 

•  You can speak telepathically to any creature you 
can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic 
utterances are in a language you know, and the 
creature understands you only if it knows that lan­
guage. Your communication doesn't give the crea­
ture the ability to respond to you telepathically. 
•  You can cast the  detect thoughts spell, requiring 
no spell slot or components, and you must finish 
a long rest before you can cast it this way again. 
Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability 
increased by this feat. If you have spell slots of 2nd 
level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.

GROUP PATRONS 

G-E 

ACH ADVENTURING GROUP  IS  BOUND 
together by the quests it embarks on and 
by the dangers its members face together. 
This chapter offers another way to bind 

your party together: a group patron. These patrons 
provide a strong binding element: an individual or 
an organization that unites a party as a team in ser­
vice to a greater purpose. A group patron can help 
set the tone of your party's entire campaign. For 
example, a group whose patron is an academic insti­
tution is likely to have a very different story from  a 
group that serves a military. A patron can influence 
characters' relationships, their backstories, and the 
types of dangers they face. 

During character creation, every player has the 
opportunity to weave connections between their 
character and the other members of their party. 
Rather  than (or in addition to) creating a web of es­
tablished relationships, players can work with  the 
DM to choose a group patron. And if you're inter­
ested in being your own patron, see the "Being Your 
Own Patron" section at the end of the chapter. 

How  PATRONS WOR K  

The following sections present several group patron 
options. The description of each patron provides 
an overview of the types of organizations the group 
patron represents, perks of membership, and quests 
the patron encourages adventurers to undertake. 
With the input of your DM, you can customize 
these patrons to reflect specific establishments in 
your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad 
tailored for organizations of your design. For ex­
ample, the guild group patron could represent the 
Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, 
the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild in Eberron, or a 
homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a 
criminal syndicate, military force, or other category 
of patron  better fits the party's goals. Choose  and 
customize the group patron  that works best for 
your party and the  types of adventures you want 
to explore. 

GROU P A s s i sTANCE 

a saving th row of another member of the party. To 
grant advantage in this way, a character and the cho­
sen target must be able to see or hear each other, 
and  neither can be incapacitated. Once a party 
member grants this advantage, that individual can't 
do so again until they finish a long rest. 

PERKS 

A group patron offers your party a number of perks 
for your service. These range from standard busi­
ness arrangements, such as a steady wage and ac­
cess to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such 
as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions 
from  certain laws. Specific perks are presented in 
the description of each group patron. 

The DM should not feel limited to providing only 
the perks noted in each group patron's description. 
Patrons give a party access to solutions and support 
they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron can use 
their varied resources to guide  their agents or pre­
pare them for greater adventures. 

ASSIGNMENTS 

Your group's  patron occasionally offers you an as­
signment, a mission that provides a springboard for 
adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond 
to your patron's demands, and interesting stories 
can result if you decide to refuse an assignment. 
A more hands-off patron can still significantly 
motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures 
based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning 
status and rewards within your organization. An 
academy, for example, might not organize particular 
missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts know­
ing that your patron will reward you for bringing 
them back. You  have the freedom to chart your own 
destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of 
your group and the adventures you undertake. 

EXAM PLE  PATRONS 

Here are some of the most likely patrons fo r  a n  ad­
venturing group. Presented in alphabetical order, 
these patrons can serve as inspiration for you to cre­
ate patrons of your own: 

Having a group patron gives an adventuring group 
a common purpose, which inspires better coordina­
tion in the form of guidance and encouragement. As 
a result of this unity,  each member of the party can 
grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or

The world's mysteries are innumerable, but you pur­
sue them with vigor. As operatives for an academy, 
you seek to unravel the secrets of existence and the 
deeper riddles beyond. 

In your work, you brush shoulders with the wisest 

in the land, travel to places spoken of in myth, and 
discover truths beyond imagining. Denying igno­
rance, you pursue wondrous sights and endlessly 
unearth new facts. Undiscovered creatures, the cov­
etous dead, and jealous rivals impede your work, but 
in the pursuit of knowledge, no risk is too great. 

TYPES OF ACADEMIES 
Any assemblage o f  scholars and truth-seekers can 
function as an academy. Generally, an academy 
unites a network of learned individuals, allowing 
them to share their knowledge, further their re­
search, and support common goals. Passing on wis­
dom to the next generation is part of an academy's 
mandate, but members find opportunities to under­
take far-flung research expeditions-only so much 

can be learned in libraries, after all. An academy's 
focus can be broad or singular,  artistic or scientific, 
mundane or magical. For every topic with unex­
plored possibilities, an academy seeks to plumb its 
depths or elevate its study. 

Roll or pick from the Academy Type table to deter­

mine the institution with which you're aligned.

ACADEMY PERKS 
With an academy as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 

Compensation.  The academy pays for the work 
you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment 
influences your compensation. On average, the 
academy pays each member of your group 1  gp per 
day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alterna­
tively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each 
artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from 
your adventures and donate to the academy. 

Documentation.  Each member of your group has 
identification denoting your affiliation with the acad­
emy.  This association carries clout in scholarly or 
artistic circles. The academy also secures documen­
tation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers 
if your work requires them. Such documents grant 
you special status, such as access to forbidden re­
gions or neutral standing in embattled  areas. Such 
identification isn't always a boon, though. In a land 
frequently plundered by foreigners, your documents 
could mark you as nothing more than aggrandized 
looters to some. 

Research.  Research is part of your group's job, 

but your patron also has abundant resources to 
facilitate such efforts. You can call in a favor to 
delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime 
activity described in the Player's Handbook and 
Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to a colleague, 
contact, librarian, or research assistant. You're re­
sponsible for covering expenses incurred as part of 
this research, and the DM determines its success 
or failure. 

Resources. Academies host libraries, museums, 
record repositories, and training facilities, and you 
can use them to further your work. You can call in a 
favor from faculty members to access resources not 
available to the public-dangerous relics or magic 
items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally, 
you  can  consult with the faculty of your academy as 
the experts in various fields. 

Training.  Because you're associated with the 
academy, you receive a discount on any education 
you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as 
a downtime activity (as described in the Player's 
Handbook or Xanathar's Guide  to Everything), you 
pay half the normal cost, assuming the academy 
teaches that subject. Training in languages,  musical 
instruments, and other tools is also available, at 
the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain pro­
ficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion 
skills by this method, as if you were learning a lan­
guage. A character can learn only one of these skills 
in this way. 

ACADEMY C ONTACT 
How much autonomy you have in choosing your 
missions and how often you're expected to perform 
on the academy's behalf depends largely on your 
place in the institution's hierarchy. As students, new 
professors, or support staff, you aid the work of a 
senior professor or entire department. If you are fur­
ther along in your career, you have your own goals 
and assistants, but you still take on assignments to 
further the goals of esteemed experts, deans, or the 
academy as a whole. In any of these cases, a specific 
contact manages your relationship to the academy. 

Roll or pick from the Academy Contact table to de­
termine who manages the relationship between you 
and the academy. 

ACA D E M Y  CO N TACT

Harried Functionary. A disinterested secretary con­
veys written correspondence to you from  an excep­

6  Distant Observer. A mysterious sponsor encourages

ACADEMY FACTOTUMS 
If you have an academy as your patron, you are 
likely engaged in a scholarly pursuit or support 
someone who is. Consider being a promising stu­
dent or a new member of the faculty. While you have 
a modest course load that you handle behind the 
scenes (or using any of a variety of downtime activi­
ties), your primary interests involve aiding your con­
tact in their research. Alternatively, you might work 
to further the academy's efforts in another way, per­
haps related to security or funding. 

The Academy Factotum Roles table provides 
suggestions for functions you perform within an 
academy and the backgrounds frequently associated 
with each role.

Your group is bound to the designs of an ancient be­
ing of tremendous power and influence. You might 
serve as the creature's eyes and ears in the world, 
carrying information back to it. Or perhaps you 
work as its direct agents, enacting its will. Whether 
you chose this arrangement or were tricked into 
it, you can count on the strange resources of your 
benefactor as long as you serve its purpose. 

TYPES OF ANCIENT BEINGS 
From brooding dragons to unfathomable voices 
whispering from the dark,  ancient beings guide 
and empower mortals for inscrutable reasons. The 
relationship your group has to its patron might be 
a clearly defined exchange, or it could be uncertain 
or forceful. Whatever the nature of the being, as 
long as your group fulfills its role, the being of-
fers rewards.

ACADEMY QUESTS 
The focus of your study and the academy's research 
defines the missions you undertake. Academics 
struggle to keep one step ahead of their scholarly 
rivals, making many of them suspicious of-even 
hostile toward-other intellectuals. Beyond rivals 
within their own profession, academics face chal­
lenges from their subjects (whether members of 
lost civilizations or magical beings) or suspicious 
anti-intellectuals. Not everyone wants to be the sub­
ject of scholarly scrutiny or thinks that solving the 
world's mysteries is important or desirable. 

The Academy Quests table presents a few of the 
sort of endeavors your work or studies lead you to 
undertake. 

ACA D E M Y  Q U E STS 

d6  Quest 

Aberrant Zoology. You  undertake expeditions to 
document, captu re,  and  expla i n  beings a ntithetical 

to the natural order. 

2  Arcanodynamics. You  i nvestigate the ways  magic 

underpins existence, exploring its flows and seeking 

ways to harness its nexuses. 
Forbidden History. You  reveal the lost truths of the 
world's  darkest ages, pursuing the h i story of p u r­

posefu l ly hidden or taboo eras. 
Cryptogeography. You  search for proof of a  h idden 
land or that the world is n 't structured as com monly 

assumed. 
Restorative Antiquarianism. You track clues leading
to p l u ndered artifacts and then restore them to 

their rightful owners. 
Evolutionary Divinity. You dare to explore what no 
mortal was meant to know: the origi n s  of divin ity.

ANC IENT BEING PERKS 
With the ancient being as your group's patron, you 
gain the following perks. 

Equipment.  Your patron's network has access 
to  certain magic items. You  can purchase common 
magic items from your patron contact. The DM de­
termines the available stock or can call for a group 
Intelligence (Investigation) check to ascertain if the 
ancient being's network can successfully locate a 
desired item.  The  DC for this check is  10 in a city, 
15  in a town,  and  20 in a village. If the check fails, 
ld8 days must pass before the same item can be 
searched for again in that community. 

The  DM sets the price of a common  magic item 

or determines it randomly: 2d4  x  10 gp, or half 
as much for a consumable item such as a potion 
or scroll. 

Research.  Relying on an ancient being's network 
of contacts, the being's vast collection of lore, or per­
haps the being's direct teaching helps you unearth 
hidden secrets. If you can contact your patron or 
their agents, your group makes ability checks made 
to research lore related to your patron's interests 
and influence with advantage. 

Sanctuary.  Your patron's agents have safe houses 
or other secure gatherings spread across a wide re­
gion. Your group knows how to locate these friendly 
enclaves and can  maintain a modest lifestyle in one 
for no cost. In return, you must defend the sanctu­
ary or protect the secret of its existence. 

Strange  Gifts.  Your patron grants your group a 
small measure of esoteric power. At 5th level, and 
again at 1 3th, you gain one supernatural gift as de­
scribed in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Mas­
ter's Guide. The DM determines which supernatural 
gifts are available.

ANCIE NT BEING OPERATIVES 
Consider the overarching goals of your group's an­
cient being patron when determining who they re­
cruit as agents.  In what arenas does that being likely 
hold sway? A powerful lich recruits other ambitious 
spellcasters, as well as skilled warriors to serve as 
bodyguards. A dragon values socially adept agents 
and those who influence society's decision-makers. 
Consider how your capabilities and interests align 
directly with those of the ancient being, or how you 
unwittingly fell into  the patron's service. 

The Ancient Being Operative Roles table suggests 

a variety of parts you can play within an ancient 
being's schemes and the backgrounds frequently 
associated with each role.

Your group serves at the pleasure of a member of 
the nobility.  Motivated by money, power, and pol­
itics, your patron uses your group to further their 
agenda without dirtying their hands, or perhaps 
they send you to the palaces of their enemies as en­
voys of peace. In exchange for loyalty and discretion, 
your patron is a powerful ally whose favor bestows 
far more than gold. 

TYPES OF ARISTOCRATS 
From the heads of scheming merchant families 
to immortal sorcerer-queens, each member of the 
aristocracy holds a measure of wealth and power­
and they desire more. The rulers of a barony could 
struggle to reclaim the influence they once held, 
while the new head of a business dynasty might 
seek to catapult their fortunes to new heights. By 
aligning with such patrons, you stand to benefit 
enormously from the fruits of their ambition.

termine what kind of noble you serve.

ARISTOCRAT PERKS 
With an aristocrat as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex­

traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. 
You are required to account for your expenses and 
must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but 
routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser­
vices don't draw a second glance. 

Immunity.  As long as you remain in the aristo­
crat's good graces, you are nearly immune to prose­
cution under the laws within the aristocrat's sphere 
of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, 
you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to 
go about that, and the law isn't an obstacle. Commit­
ting serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated 
or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way 
to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. 
Luxury.  Your patron deigns to host you at their 
home or in other luxurious accommodations for a 
brief period as reward for a job well  done.  Such a 
stay typically lasts for no longer  than two weeks per 
year, during which you maintain an aristocratic life­
style for no cost. You must defend the locale if nec­
essary, but you're largely afforded time to relax as 
you please. However, poor (or outright destructive) 
guests  rarely receive invitations to stay again.

Salary.  Your employment under an aristocratic 
patron brings an income of 1  gp per day, or enough 
to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discre­
tion, your salary increases or decreases depending 
on the aristocrat's nature, the type of work, and the 
length of your employment. 

ARISTOC RAT C ONTACT 
Aside from a few exceptions, aristocrats prefer to 
have  someone else handle communication with the 
hired help. As a result, you communicate with an 
intermediary who serves as a go-between in your 
dealings with your patron. 

Roll or pick from the Aristocrat Contact table to 

determine who serves as your patron's proxy.

ARISTOCRAT RETAINERS 
Aristocrats seek agents to pursue business, polit­
ical, criminal, or personal agendas. In return, you 
might serve an aristocrat merely for the  salary or to 
gain access to particular tools, information, or polit­
ical clout. Or you  could be a lesser family member, 
expected to serve the will of family leaders. Regard­
less of your skills or social standing, aristocratic 
patrons with enough foresight and imagination find 
a use for agent� from any background.

agenda and the backgrounds frequently associated

A missive from your patron proffers a different kind

as an envoy during delicate trade negotiations; the 
next, you're sent trekking through mountain passes 
to gather a favorite flower for a party. Foes are end­
less, and yesterday's ally might be tomorrow's tar­
get. The only things that are certain are the variety 
of your patron's whims and that tomorrow there will 
surely be more.

TYPES OF  CRIMINAL SYNDICATES 
Criminal syndicates range from the local thieves' 
guild, to a corrupt consortium of merchant princes, 
to a ring of otherworldly invaders infiltrating all 
levels of society for a nefarious purpose. Whatever 
form it takes, the syndicate is largely concerned 
with increasing wealth for its members at the ex­
pense of society at large. 

Conversely, the syndicate could be an under­
ground organization of good-hearted people fight­
ing against a wicked power structure. Criminal 
syndicates with a heroic bent include the band of 
plucky outlaws who hijack taxes from the cruel 
baron and return them to the downtrodden and a 
hard-bitten ring of deserters who fight their home­
land's invaders. 

Roll or pick from the Syndicate Types table to 

determine what type of criminal organization 
you serve.

M e m bers of the society hone their ski l l s as cut­

TA�HA ·

A network of criminals employs your group. You 
could be  full-fledged members in  good  standing 
with the syndicate or probationary inductees look­
ing to make your mark and earn  its trust. Perhaps 
your group works for the syndicate against your will: 
you owe them big for a job gone wrong, for killing 
the wrong person, or simply for being born into a 
family that's already in conflict with powerful, un­
scrupulous people. 

CRIMINAL SYNDICATE PERKS 
With the criminal syndicate as your group's patron, 
you gain the following perks. 

Assignments.  The syndicate doesn't pay you 
directly, but it assigns you to particular tasks on 
behalf of its clients or the organization. Someone 
hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an 
assassination), and the syndicate passes 85 percent 
of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich 
the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you 
have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you 
steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a  1 5  
percent share, at the DM's discretion. 

Contraband. You have access to your syndicate's 
business in  contraband, such as poisons or narcot­
ics. You don't receive a discount on  these goods, but 
you can always find someplace to  purchase them. 
Fences. Members or associates of your syndi­
cate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and 
you have access to this service as well. Fences 
are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also 
expensive items such as works of art and magic 
items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to 
delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime ac­
tivity described in the Dungeon Master's Guide and 
Xanathar's Guide to Everything) to the fence. When 
using the syndicate's fences, you run no risk of a 
double-cross or other mishap  in finding a buyer, but 
the  syndicate  takes  20  percent of the  sale price as a 
finder's fee. 

Safe Houses. The syndicate maintains safe 
houses or other secret hiding spots across a wide 
region. Your group knows how to locate these non­
descript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle 
in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether 
purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor 
with the  syndicate and may see you banned from 
using them. 

Syndicate-Owned Businesses. The syndicate 
owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for 
laundering money. When you buy from one of these 
businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM 
decides what goods and services are available. 

CRIMI NAL SYNDICATE C ONTACT 
Each member of the syndicate has a place in the 
organization. You report to a contact who handles 
your contribution by giving you assignments, collect­
ing the syndicate's cut of your swag, or seeing that 
you receive your fee for contract work from outside 
clients. The contact is your first point of communica­
tion if you need to reach out to highly ranked mem­
bers of the syndicate's hierarchy. 

Roll or pick from the  Syndicate Contact table 
to determine your contact within a criminal or­
ganization.

Clever Urchin. An i n nocuous person, perhaps a  beg· 
gar or menial laborer,  knows a l l  the right people and 

shares their connections with you. 
Former Law Enforcement. Your contact used to  be 
(or maybe still is) a  mem ber of local law enforce· 

ment. They have sharp  i nsight  i nto the law's work· 

in gs in you r  area and a  healthy dose of paranoia for 

that reason. 
Bon Vivant. The boss of a  l ocal den of vice­
whether gambling, narcotics, or other p l easures­

aids you when they're not distracted by their own 

debauchery. 
Traitor. You  know you r  contact in  the syndicate has 
betrayed it, but they have e nough clout and leverage 

that you don't dare cross them-yet. 
Criminal Royalty. U n known to most, you r  contact 
is a  member of local  nobility or royalty. Why they 

maintain relations with the synd i cate is a tro u b l i n g  

mystery. 

CRIMI NAL SYNDICATE MEMBERS 
Whether you're a lifelong scoundrel or an ambi· 
tious upstart, you seek to gain wealth, fame, and 
influence within a criminal syndicate. A syndicate 
is motivated by profit, employing agents with all 
manner of talents. Nimbleness and novelty prove 
vital not just to exploiting untapped prospects but to 
avoiding the law. You embody rare experience and 
skill, positioned at the forefront of daring new crim­
inal ventures.

Your work as a syndicate member involves more 
than  simple  street swindles or pickpocketing. 
Someone with your skills cooperates with others

TASHA 

Your group has ties to a powerful consortium of 
professionals who work together for mutual benefit. 
You might be long-time members of such a guild, de­
scended from a family of crafters or merchants from 
which you inherited membership, or perhaps you're 
working to earn entrance on your own merits. If you 
serve the guild's interests well, it promises to take 
care of you. Guilds hate to waste valuable assets, 
after all-that's just bad business. 

TYPES OF GUILD 
The guild structure covers a swath of business ven­
tures, differentiated by their specialty. A conglom­
erate of blacksmiths, jewelers, carpenters, tailors, 
alchemists, scribes, and sages all could organize as 
a guild. Whatever their trade, these experts share 
contacts, exchange resources such as materials or 
tools, and leverage their collective influence to affect 
politics for their benefit. Alternatively, merchants 
and other business owners might also organize into 
guilds. Merchant barons who effectively rule a city 
or nation through  iron-clad control of the economy 
or a network of innkeepers who share news and 
supply routes could both represent guild patrons. 
A guild could even embody a more sinister group, 
such as one that deals in terrifying wares like 
deadly monsters, dangerous knowledge, or souls. 
Roll or pick from the Guild Types table to deter­

mine the general sort of organization you oper­
ate within.

Crafters' Guild. This conglomerate of artisans pools

create the wares they peddle, instead specializing in

who deal with la rge sums of wealth. They exchan ge

GUILD PERKS 
With a guild as your group's patron, you gain the 
following perks. These perks require an annual 
contribution of 15 gp paid to the guild (replacing the 
5 gp per month cost for characters with the Guild 
Artisan background). These dues fund the guild's 
services and activities. 

Accommodations.  You can stay at your organi­
zation's guildhall. The rooms are comparable to 
those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 
sp per day). 

Equipment.  You can requisition the  use of spe­
cialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other craft­
ing space and equipment to use  within the  guildhall. 
When you make an ability check with a set of arti­
san's tools using the guild's equipment, add double 
your normal proficiency bonus to the check. 

Resources.  You can leverage the guild's exten­
sive contacts to locate exotic materials for crafting, 
spell components, or magic items, or buyers for 
them (a downtime activity in the  Dungeon Master's 
Guide  and Xanathar's Guide  to Everything). You 

can locate or sell legal commodities using the 
guild's resources, and any prices tip in your favor by 
10 percent. 

Training.  The guild retains knowledgeable tutors 

in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you un­
dertake the training downtime activity (as described 
in the Player's Handbook and Xanathar's Guide to 
Everything), the training takes half as long if you 
are studying a subject the guild specializes in. The 
DM decides if the guild has tutors available for a 
given subject. 

GUI LD  C ONTACT 
Even as a member in good standing of the guild, 
you can't simply stroll up to the guild master and 
d.emand their attention. Your superiors within the 
guild manage work contracts, request the use of 
guild resources, and facilitate getting your group 
in contact with the right people to assist their 
interests.

GU ILD REPRESENTATIVES 
As a guild member, you might be a professional 
who works directly toward the guild's specialty or 
whose fortunes align with the guild's interests. Al­
ternatively, you could provide the guild with services 
to which their members aren't suited. For example, 
guards, explorers, negotiators, and spies can be 
useful to a guild, whether its interests lie in trade 
goods, entertainment, or more questionable ven­
tures. Whether a guild operates entirely within the 
law and how public its interests are also influences 
which of your skills it deems most valuable.

Competition is fierce in the business world, and the

TASHA 

Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger 
military force, one dedicated to combat missions or
other dangerous tasks. You could be a band of mer­
cenaries, a special forces unit, or a squad of regular 
infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from 
monsters, or you fight secret battles in  the  wake 
of a war that has supposedly ended. Or the  nation 
requires military forces at the edges of civilization 
to protect the frontier and to lead advancement into 
new territory. 

ITPES OF MI LITARY FORCES 
Military forces represent a variety o f  organized 
bands of warriors. They can be the disciplined reg­
iments of a nation's standing army, a fleet of ships 
comprising a kingdom's armada, or a devastating 
horde of warriors and magical beasts. A given king­
dom's military could be a rigidly ordered force or a 
blood-soaked throng. 

Roll or pick from the Military Force Types table 

to determine the general type of military patron 
you serve. 

4  Horde. The horde is  almost a  force  of nature, a n d  
what it  l acks  in  discipline it  makes  up  i n  ferocity.  It 

5

does n ' t  have a  rigid com mand structu re, i n stead 

fun ctioning like a  pyramid of smaller armies .  Horde 

commanders owe fealty to stronger leaders above 

them, all the way up to the warlord .  
Planar Conscripts. This m i litary force  battles for cos­
mic  stakes on far-fl u n g  planes of the m u ltiverse or 

fi ghts against extraplanar i nvasion on the  M aterial 

Plane. Warriors incl ude conscri pts  pressed i nto  ser­

vice in the Blood War, fodder in  the thrall of ruthless 

yugoloth  mercen a ries, or mem bers of a glorious ce­

lestial host defending against fiendish i nc u rsion . 
Sky Warriors. This military fo rce consists of winged 
creatures, e m ploys magical fl ight, or sails airships 

as a sky navy. Traditional d efenses are i neffective 

against attacks from the a i r,  position i n g  the sky war­

riors as a fearsome nation or expensive a n d  coveted 

mercenaries. 

MILITARY FORCE PE RKS 
With a military force as your group's patron, you 
gain the following perks. 

Armory.  You can purchase nonmagical weapons 

and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility 
associated with your military force. You can buy 
magic items at the DM's discretion, but you receive 
no discount. 

Chain of Command. You are part of a hierarchy 
that provides you with orders.  If you cause trouble 
fo your own nation, you answer to your officers, not 
local law enforcement. 

Oflicial Access. Your rank in the military force 

grants you access to places that are off limits to 
civilians. With your commander's permission, you 
can enter dangerous training grounds or military in­
stallations, like an army's regional  headquarters or 

9 6  

C H A P T E R  2  I  G ROU P  PATRONS 

a repository of top-secret intelligence. You can also 
request that your commander grant you authority 
to act in their name or provide access to experts or 
leaders higher in the chain of command. 

Orders. You undertake your missions at the di­
rection of a commanding officer, who expects your 
absolute obedience. These missions have clear and 
precise goals, leading you on the path of adventure. 
In rare cases, you're trusted with open-ended tasks 
that afford you leeway in interpreting orders. 

Salary.  Each member of your group earns a regu­
lar salary or share of the military force's spoils. The 
amount varies depending on your organization and 
your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a 
modest lifestyle. You receive a small salary (as little 
as 1  sp per day) and food and housing on a military 
base. Or you receive 1  gp per day but rely on that 
money for room and board. With higher rank comes 
higher pay. As an officer, you maintain a comfortable 
lifestyle. 

MILITARY FORCE C ONTACT 
Your primary contact within your hierarchy is your 
superior officer, the person who gives you orders 
and is responsible for your success or failure.

M ILITARY FORCE ENVOYS 
You might join a military force for a wide range of 
reasons, or the military has reasons for seeking 
you out. Those with specialized skills contribute to 
a range of missions, from infiltration and mystical 
operations to diplomacy and strategy. Perhaps your 
past deeds or the will of your family pushes you 
toward military service, regardless of whether you 
believe you're  suited to such a life.

MILITARY QUESTS 
The wide-ranging work of a military unit calls for 
both power and  subtlety. Your missions could run 
the  risk of shattering a fragile peace recently es­
tablished with a rival nation and plunging multiple 
nations back into war. Or perhaps your group's 
missions pit you against rival combatants during an 
active engagement, as you influence the war effort. 
Rival mercenary companies, armed resistance fight­
ers, and monsters drawn to the presence of blood­
shed also present familiar threats. 

The Military Quests table provides possible mis­

sions you're tasked to accomplish.

RELIGIOUS  ORDER 

TYPES OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS 
Not every religious order represents an alliance of 
worshipers devoted to godly ideals. Perhaps your 
group is a team of devotees pursuing a cause for 
your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking 
advantage of a wealthy congregation. Your collec­
tive faith could compel you to hunt evil monsters or 
stave off otherworldly invasions, to protect the pow­
erless from oppression, or to spread  the teachings of 
your religion in a hostile land. Or perhaps you serve 
a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly 
disappear-though even cynical mercenaries can 
become true believers when confronted with the 
miraculous.

TA�HA · 

A leader without allies is not long a leader. You 
serve a sovereign-a national figure or otherwise­
and work to achieve their goals no matter the cost. 
As agents of a sovereign, you serve as diplomats 
or enforcers, spies or fixers, bringers of aid or exec­
utors of justice. You work within the system to up­
hold the status quo or step beyond the law to prevent 
war and worse. Politics, espionage, and mystery are 
facts of your world, as is hope and the fragile prom­
ise of peace. 

TYPES OF SOVEREIGNS 
Broadly defined, a sovereign ranges from the head 
of a government to the leader of a powerful, private 
institution. Queens, chieftains, sultans, and rajahs 
are ready choices for powerful individuals who pa­
tronize a party of adventurers. Those on track to be­
come such individuals-such as cunning senators, 
royal heirs, or influential celebrities-also fill a sov­
ereign's role. When choosing or creating a sovereign 
to serve, consider whether that leader commands a 
government organization or another faction. While

RELIGIOUS ORDER QUE STS 
The services you provide your religious order vary 
depending on the deity you serve and your party's 
aptitudes. Regardless, religious orders are opposed 
by antagonistic faiths, foes whose rivalry with your 
order emulates the conflict between your respective 
gods. Some  religious orders also hunt and destroy 
fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abom­
inations, seeking to rid the word of their influence. 
Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to 
demonstrate the primacy of their deity. 

The  Religious Order Quests table presents a

your deity.

Village Elder. The wizened leader of a community 
offers both civic and moral leadership. 
Young Noble. An ambitious noble eagerly seeks to 
reform society to align with a personal vision. 
Shipwrecked Governor. A desperate leader struggles 
to keep people alive in a wilderness they're not pre· 
pared to endure. 
Ruler Returned. A tribe's revered leader has re·

SOVEREIGN PERKS 
With the sovereign as your group's patron, you gain 
the following perks. 

Elite Access. While in service to the sovereign, 
you have access to the highest echelons of society. 
With your patron's permission, you can gain access 
to the halls of power, from national capitols and 
military headquarters to noble estates and troves 
of state secrets. You can also request that the sov­
ereign grant you access to perks of their position, 
like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the 
royal guards. 

Expenses. Your patron reimburses you for ex­

traordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. 
You are required to account for your expenses and 
must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but 
routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic ser­
vices don't draw a second glance. 

Immunity.  As Jong as you remain in the sov­
ereign's good graces, you are nearly immune to 
prosecution under the laws within their sphere of 
influence. When you are carrying out your orders, 
you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to 
go about that, and the Jaw isn't an obstacle. Commit­
ting serious crimes-especially if they are unrelated 
or unnecessary for the assigned work-is a sure way 
to fall  out of your patron's good graces, however. 
Salary. Your employment under a sovereign pa­
tron brings an income of 1  gp per day, or enough to 
maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, 
your salary increases or decreases depending on 
the sovereign's nature, the type of work you per­
form, and the length of your employment.

SOVEREIGN QUESTS 
The services you provide a sovereign largely depend 
on the nature of your group patron and their nation. 
While some of your missions involve official tasks­
missions undertaken in the sovereign's name-oth­
ers might be covert, making your patron's identity a 
highly guarded secret. Political rivals, enemy coun­
tries, and natural disasters all pose dangers to the 
sovereign's nation. Yet a sovereign who sows chaos, 
enacts tyrannical decrees, or jeopardizes a popu­
lation's way of life is likely to inspire rebellions. In 
such cases, a sovereign's agents must decide where 
their loyalties lie. 

The Sovereign Quests table presents a few of the 

sorts of missions you undertake for your liege. 

SOV E R E I G N  Q U ESTS 

d6  Quest 

International Espionage. You attempt to steal intelli­
gence, national symbols, or super weapons from an 
enemy power. 
Undermine Rival. You seek to weaken or remove 
a rival to the regent's rule-perhaps a general, an 
archdruid, or a noble with a claim to the throne. 
Expel Corruption. You help the sovereign reform 
their government, rooting out institutional vices. 
Subvert Blame. The sovereign is caught in an em­
barrassing affair. Make it disappear.

SOVEREIGN  C ONTACT 
You might benefit from direct contact with your 
group patron. This includes audiences or secret 
meetings with the sovereign, depending on the na­
ture of your work. Alternatively, the sovereign might 
purposefully wantto keep their distance from you, 
either due to their busy schedules or to maintain 
plausible deniability regarding your work. In such 
cases, an advisor or functionary oversees your as­
signments,  serving as the primary contact between 
you and the sovereign.

hands clean. 

3  Administrator. This severe bureaucrat disagrees 

with many of the sovereign's policies but takes loyal 
service seriously. 
Executive Assistant. The responsibilities of an exact­

SOVEREIGN PROXIES 
You serve a sovereign out of national pride, out of 
tradition, or for your own practical reasons. The 
needs of a leader potentially embroil you directly in 
political intrigues, court maneuverings, or threats 
from national foes. It's up to you and the sovereign 
to  determine whether your work is publicly acknowl­
edged or top secret-and if the latter, what happens 
if your work is exposed. 

The Sovereign Proxy Roles table suggests ways 
you might serve a sovereign and  the  backgrounds 
frequently associated with each role.

B E ING YOU R  OWN  PATRON 

For some players, the idea of running a crime syn­
dicate, mercenary company, arcane scholars' collec­
tive, or other organization is far more exciting than 
working for someone else.  Founding your own orga­
nization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though 
potentially at the cost of support and reliable work. 
When you're the boss, the perks of belonging to 
an organization become expenses you  have  to worry 
about;  when you run your own mercenary company, 
for example, you need to stock your own armory, 
rather than drawing on an existing organization's 
stockpile. The organization brings in income, 
but you'll have to spend it to keep the organiza-
tion running. 

When you run your own organization, use the 

Running a Business downtime activity (described in 
the Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organi­
zation's ongoing activities. More than one character 
can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling 
to determine the business's performance, add the 
total days spent by the characters to the roll to de­
termine the business's success (still observing the 
maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, mul­
tiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who 
took part in this downtime activity. 

Don't discount the value of adopting an NPC to 
serve as your contact within your own organization. 
A secretary, majordomo, or apprentice keeps up 
with your group's bureaucracy while you're con­
ducting missions and passes along information that 
could lead to your next adventure!

AGIC  IS EVERYWHERE IN D&D. MANY 
creatures in the D&D multiverse ex-

magic, spellcasters harness magical 

energy every day in the form of spells, and supernat­

those last two things-spells and magic items. 

The chapter first presents new spells for player

TA�HA 

This section contains new spells that the DM may 
add to a campaign, making them available to player 
character and monster spellcasters alike. The Spells 
table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. 
The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, 
whether it requires concentration, whether it bears 
the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it. 

If you'd like to use any of these spells, talk to your 

DM, who may allow some, all, or none of them.

SPELL  DESCRIPTIONS 

The spells are presented in alphabetical order. 

BLADE OF D I SASTER 
9th-level conjuration 
Casting T ime:  1  bonus action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to  1  minute 

You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet 
long in an unoccupied space you can see within 
range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you 
cast this spell, you can  make up to two melee spell 
attacks with the blade, each one against a creature, 
loose object, or structure within 5 feet of the blade. 
On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage. This 
attack scores a critical hit if the number on the d20 
is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals 
an extra 8d l 2  force damage (for a total of 1 2 d 1 2  
force damage). 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the 
blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can 
see and then make up to two melee spell attacks 
with it again. 

The blade can harmlessly pass through any bar­

rier, including a wall of force. 

BOOMING BLADE 
Evocation cantrip 

Casting T ime: 1  action 
Range: Self (5-foot radius) 
Components:  S, M (a  melee  weapon worth at 

least  1  sp) 

Duration:  1  round 

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's cast­
ing and make a melee attack with it against one 
creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target 
suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then 
becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start 
of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet 
or more before then, the target  takes  ld8 thunder 
damage, and the spell ends. 

This spell's damage increases when you reach 
certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an 
extra  ld8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and 
the damage the target takes for moving increases to 
2d8. Both damage rolls increase by ld8 at  1 1th level 
(2d8 and 3d8) and again at  17th level (3d8 and 4d8). 

D REAM OF THE BLUE VEI L  
7th-level conjuration

creature from the destination world) 

Duration: 6 hours

C H A PT E R  3  I  M A G I C A L  M I S C E LL A N Y  

TRAV E L I N G  T O  OTH E R  WOR L D S  
The Material Plane holds an infinite number of worlds. 
Some-like Oerth, Tori!, Krynn, and Eberron-are well 
documented, but there are countless others. You and 
your friends may even have created some homemade 
D&D worlds yourselves! 

It was not always so. Various scholars speak of a pri­
mordial state, a single real ity they call the First World, 
which preceded the multiverse as we know it. Many 
of the peoples and monsters that i nhabit the worlds 
in the Material Plane originated there. After the First 
World was shattered by a great cataclysm-giving 
birth to the worlds that came in its wake-the progeny 
of the first elves, dwarves, beholders, and other iconic 
creatures took root on world after world, like seeds 
scattered by a cosmic wind. If the musings of these 
great sages are true, every world is a reflection-and 
in some cases, a distortion-of the First World. 
Transit between these worlds is rare but not im­
possible and can be accomplished in various ways. 
One such method is called the Great Journey, an epic 
voyage fraught with peril and littered with obstacles to 
be overcome. This journey most often occurs aboard a 
vessel powered by magic. 

Another method is the Dream of Other Worlds; trav­
elers fal l  into a deep slumber and dream themselves 
into a new realm. The spell dream of the blue veil em­
ploys this method of transit. 

The most direct method is the Leap to Another 
Realm; a spellcaster casts teleportation circle or tele­
port, aiming to appear in a known teleportation circle 
or some other location in another world. 

Whatever method you use to reach a world, the OM 

determines whether you succeed and where exactly 
you appear if you do arrive in that realm. 

You and up to eight willing creatures within range 
fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experi­
ence visions of another world on the Material Plane, 
such as Oerth, Tori!, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell 
reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with 
each of you encountering and pulling back a mys­
terious blue curtain. The  spell  then ends with you 
mentally and physically transported to the world 
that was in the visions. 

To  cast this spell, you must have a magic item that 

originated on the world you wish to reach, and you 
must be aware of the world's existence, even if you 
don't  know  the  world's name. Your destination in the 
other world is a safe location within 1  mile of where 
the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can 
cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was 
born on the other world, which  causes your destina­
tion to be a safe location within  1  mile of where that 
creature was born. 

The spell ends early on a creature if that creature 

takes any damage, and the creature isn't trans­
ported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for 
you and all the  other creatures, with none of you 
being transported. 

GREEN-FLAME BLADE 
Evocation  cantrip 

Casting Time:  1  action 
Range: Self (5-foot radius) 
Components: S,  M (a melee weapon worth at 

least  1 sp) 

· 

Duration: Instantaneous 

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting 
and make a melee attack with it against one crea­
ture within  5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers 
the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can 
cause green fire to leap from the target to a different 
creature of your choice that you can see within  5 
feet of it. The  second creature takes fire damage 
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. 

This spell's damage  increases when you reach 
certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an 
extra  1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the 
fire damage to the second creature increases to  1d8 
+ your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage 
rolls increase by 1d8 at  1 1 th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 
17th level (3d8 and 3d8). 

INTELLECT FORTRES S  
3rd-level abjuration 

Casting T ime:  1  action 
Range: 30 feet 

Components: V 
Duration: Concentration, up to  1  hour 

For the duration, you or one willing creature you 
can  see within range has resistance to psychic dam­
age, as well as advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma saving throws. 

At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one 
additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The 
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when 
you target them. 

LIGHTNI NG LURE 
Evocation  cantrip 

Casting T ime:  1  action 
Range: Self (1 5-foot radius) 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes 
at one creature of your choice that you can see 
within  15 feet of you. The target must succeed on a 
Strength saving throw or be pulled up to  10 feet in a 
straight line  toward you and  then  take  1d8 lightning 
damage if it is within 5 feet of you. 

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you 

reach  5th level (2d8),  1 1th level  (3d8),  and  17th 
level (4d8). 

MIND SLIVER 
Enchantment cantrip 

Casting T ime:  1  action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration:  1  round 

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into 
the mind of one creature you can see within range. 
The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving 
throw or take  ld6 psychic damage and subtract  ld4 
from the next saving throw it makes before the end 
of your next turn. 

This spell's damage increases by ld6 when you 
reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6),  1 1th level (3d6), 
and  17th level (4d6). 

SPIRIT SHROUD 
3rd-level necromancy 

Casting T ime:  1  bonus action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to  1  minute 

You call forth spirits of the dead, which flit around 
you for the spell's duration. The spirits are intangi­
ble and invulnerable. 

Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals 
ld8 extra damage when you hit a creature within  10 
feet of you. This damage is radiant, necrotic, or cold 
(your choice when you cast the spell). Any creature 
that takes this damage can't regain hit points until 
the start of your next turn. 

In addition, any creature of your choice that you 
can see that starts its turn within  10 feet of you has 
its speed reduced by  10 feet until the start of your 
next turn. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 

a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage in­
creases by  ld8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.

TA�llA 

Just as every performer lends their art a personal 
flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles 
through the lens of their own training, so too can a 
spellcaster use magic to express their individuality. 
Regardless of what type of spellcaster you're play­
ing, you can customize the  cosmetic effects of your 
character's spells. Perhaps you wish the effects of 
your caster's spells to appear in their favorite color, 
to suggest the training they received from a celestial 
mentor, or to exhibit their connection to a season 
of the year. The possibilities for how you might 
cosmetically customize your character's spells are 
endless. However, such alterations can't change the 
effects of a spell. They also can't make one spell 
seem like another-you can't, for example, make a 
magic missile look like a fireball. 

When customizing your spellcaster's magic, con­
sider developing a theme-often, the broader and 
more versatile the better. You may describe your 
caster's magic whenever you wish, particularly 
when it makes an interesting addition to a story. 
You may also  use it to reinforce other choices you've 
made for your character, like making a bard's spells 
tied more closely to their favored art form or a cler­
ic's spells themed around their deity. 

For example, the fireball of a wizard with a 

fondness for storms  might  erupt to look like burn­
ing clouds or a burst of red lightning (without 
affecting the spell's damage type), while the same 
wizard's haste spell might limn the target in faint 
thunderheads. 

Alternatively, a cleric who serves a moon god 
might radiate faint moonlight around their hands 
when they cast cure wounds, or their shield of faith 
might surround the target with glimmering cres­
cent moons. 

Further still, a druid could choose a cherry 
blossom theme for their magic,  causing delicate 
branches and pink leaves to grow when they cast en­
tangle or shillelagh, and their faerie fire spell could 
appear more like wind-tossed petals than flames. 

The Magic Themes table offers just a few sugges­

tions that might inspire you while personalizing 
your character's spells. 

MAG I C  TH E M ES 
dlO  Theme 

Book pages, origami, quills, and ink, all accompa­
nied by rustling sounds and library scents 
Brine-scented shapes of sharks, jellyfish, octopi, 
and other sea creatures 
Food or utensils that carry the scent of cuisine 
from the spellcaster's homeland 
Rich, copper scents accom panied by what ap­
pears to be the caster's own imbalanced humors 
Bursts and strokes of watercolor painted by an 
invisible brush 
Transparent weapons, armor, miniature war ma­
chines, and phantom soldiers 
Golden rays that carry faint warmth and the hint 
of windblown sand 
Rowdy barnyard animals accompanied by the 
warm scents of coops and stables 
Manifestations of deep emotions, like the faint 
shackles of melancholy, sepia shades of nostalgia, 
or heart-shaped bursts of affection 
Tiny whimsical o r  fearsome beings from the spell-
caster's inescapable, recurring dreams

MAGIC TATTOOS 

• 

Blending magic and artistry with  ink and needles, 
magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous 
abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic 
needles, which transfer their magic to a creature. 
Once inscribed on a creature's body, damage or 
injury doesn't impair the  tattoo's function, even if 
the tattoo is defaced. When applying a magic tattoo, 
a creature can  customize the  tattoo's appearance. A 
magic  tattoo can look like a brand, scarification, a 
birthmark, patterns of scale, or any other cosmetic 
alteration. 

The rarer a magic tattoo is,  the more space it typ-
ically occupies on a creature's skin. The Magic Tat-
too Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a 
given tattoo is.

MAGIC  ITEM D ESCRIPTIONS 

The following magic  items are presented in alpha­
betical order. 

ABSORBING TATTOO 
Wondrous item (tattoo),  very rare (requires 
attunement) 

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo fea­
tures designs that emphasize one color. 

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you 
hold the  needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear, pressing the  needle there throughout 
the attunement process.  When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 

Damage Resistance.  While the tattoo is on 

your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage 
associated with that color, as shown on the table 
below. The DM chooses the color or determines 
it randomly.

Damage Absorption.  When you take damage of 
the chosen type, you  can  use your reaction to gain 
immunity against that instance of the damage, and 
you regain a number of hit points equal to  half the 
damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is 
used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. 

ALC HEMICAL C OMPENDIUM 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by  a 
wizard) 

Acrid  odors cling to this stained, heavy volume. The 
book's metal fittings are copper, iron , lead, silver, 
and gold, some frozen mid-transition from  one 
metal to another. When found, the book contains the 
following spells: enlarge/reduce, feather fall, flesh to 
stone, gaseous form, magic  weapon, and polymorph. 
It functions as a spellbook for you. 

While you are holding the book, you can use it as 

a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. 

The book has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 ex­
pended charges daily at dawn. You can  use  the 
charges in the following ways while holding it: 

If you spend  1  minute studying the book, you 
can expend  1  charge to replace one of your 
prepared wizard spells with a different spell in 
the book. The new spell must be of the trans­
mutation school. 

•  As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object 
that isn't being worn or carried and spend a num­
ber of charges to transform the target into another 
object. For 1  charge, the object can be no larger 
than  1  foot on a side. You can spend additional 
charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 
2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold 
value equal to or less than the original.

(+3)  (requires attunement by  an  artificer)

ety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and 
transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your 
choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the Player's 
Handbook for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever 
form the tool takes, you  are proficient with it. 

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the 
spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your 
artificer spells.  The bonus is determined by the 
tool's rarity. 

As an action, you can focus on the tool  to channel 
your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't 
know from any class list. For 8  hours, you can cast 
that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip 
for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used 
again until the next dawn. 

AMULET OF THE  DEVOUT 
Wondrous item,  uncommon (+l),  rare (+2),  very rare 
(+3)  (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin) 

This amulet bears the symbol of a deity inlaid with 
precious stones or metals. While you wear the holy 
symbol, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and 
the saving th row DCs of your spells. The bonus is 
determined by the amulet's rarity. 

While you wear this amulet, you can use your 
Channel Divi nity feature without expending one 
of the feature's uses. Once this property is used, it 
can't be used again until the next dawn.

sorcerer) 

This crystal is a solidified shard of the Astral Plane, 
swirling with silver mist. As an action, you can at­
tach the  shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon 
or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your 
attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a 
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells while you 
hold or wear it. 

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell 
while you are holding or wearing the shard, imme­
diately after casting the spell you can teleport to an 
unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you.

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a 
wizard) 

This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings un­

BABA YAGA'S MORTAR AND PESTLE 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy 
the laws of mortal magic. Among the  notorious 
implements that.cement her legend on countless 
worlds are the artifacts that propel her through 
the planes: Baba Yaga 's  Mortar and Pestle. These 
signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact 
for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects 
become separated, the pestle appears next to the 
mortar at the next dawn. 

Random Properties.  This artifact has the follow­
ing random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the  tables in  the  "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide: 

•  2  minor beneficial properties 
•  1  major beneficial property 
•  1  minor detrimental property 

Properties of the Mortar.  The mortar is a Tiny 

wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in 
size to accommodate anything you place inside, ex­
panding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, 
meaning it can hold even a Large creature. 

Properties of the Pestle.  The pestle is a 6-inch­

long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn 
while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it 
into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no 
action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a 
magic weapon  that grants a +3  bonus to  attack and 
damage rolls made with it. 

The pestle has 1 2  charges. When you hit with a 
melee  attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 
3 of its charges to deal  an extra  ld8 force damage 
for each charge expended. The pestle regains all ex­
pended charges daily at dawn. 

Perfect Tools.  While holding the mortar and pes­
tle, you can use your action to say the name of any 
nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount 
of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar in­
stantly fi lls with the desired amount of that material. 
Once you use this action, you can't do so again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 

You can also use the artifact as alchemist's sup­
plies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herb­
alism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage 
on any check you make using the artifact as one of 
these tools. 

Primal Parts.  As an action while the pestle and 
the mortar ,is within 5 feet of you, you can command 
the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you 
use your action to verbally command it to stop, the 
pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of 
the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally 
useful for cooking or alchemy. At the  start of each 
of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 
force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points 

to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, 
as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If 
you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the 
mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, 
crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles. 
Traverse the Night.  If you are holding the pestle 

while you are inside the mortar, you can use your 
action to verbally command the mortar to travel 
to a specific place or creature. You don't need to 
know where your destination is, but it must be a 
specific destination-not just  the nearest river or a 
red dragon's lair.  If the  stated destination is within 
1 ,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and 
vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel 
through a dreamlike sky, with  hazy reflections of the 
world passing by below. Creatures might see images 
of you streaking through the sky between your point 
of origin and the destination. You arrive at the loca­
tion 1  hour later or, if it is night,  1  minute later. 

Bones Know Their Home.  When you command 
the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the 
dust or paste of something ground by the mortar 
and name a location on a different plane of exis­
tence or a different world on the Material Plane. 
If that material came from a creature native to the 
named plane or world, the mortar travels through 
an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that 
destination, arriving in 1  minute.

Destroying  the Mortar and Pestle.  The mortar 
and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed under­
foot by the Dancing Hut of Baba  Yaga or by Baba 
Yaga  herself.

BELL BRANCH 
Wondrous item,  rare (requires attunement by  a 
druid or warlock) 

This silver implement is shaped like a tree branch 
and is strung with small golden bells. The branch is 
a spel lcasting focus for your spells while you hold it. 

The branch has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 
expended charges daily at dawn. You  can use the 
charges in the following ways while holding it: 

•  As a bonus action, you can expend  1  charge to 
detect the presence of aberrations, celestials, 
constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead 
within 60 feet of you. If such creatures are pres­
ent and don't have total cover from you, the bells 
ring softly, their tone indicating the creature 
types present. 
As an action, you can expend  1  charge  to cast pro­
tection from evil and good. 

BLOOD FURY TATTOO 
Wondrous item (taitoo), legendary (requires 
attunement) 

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo 
evokes fury in its form and colors. 

Tattoo Attunement.  To  attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear,  pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 

lf your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 

Bloodthirsty Strikes.  The tattoo has  10 charges, 

and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. 
While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the follow­
ing benefits: 

•  When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you 
can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic 
damage to the target, and you regain a number of 
hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. 
•  When a creature you can see damages you, you 
can expend a charge and use your reaction to 
make a melee attack against that creature, with 
advantage on your attack roll. 

BLOODWELL VIAL 
Wondrous item,  uncommon (+1),  rare (+2),  very rare 
(+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer) 

To attune to this vial, you must place a few drops 
of your blood into it. The vial can't be opened while 
your attunement to it  lasts.  If your attunement to the 
vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash . You can 
use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells 
while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus 
to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of 
your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by 
the  vial's rarity. 

In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover 
hit points  while you are carrying the  vial, you can re­
gain  5 sorcery  points.  This property of the vial can't 
be used again until the next dawn. 

CAULDRON  OF REBIRTH 
Wondrous item,  very rare (requires attunement by  a 
druid or warlock) 

This Tiny pot  bears relief scenes of heroes on its 
cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spell­
casting focus for your druid spells, and it functions 
as a suitable component for the scrying spell. When 
you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to 
create a potion  of greater healing. The potion lasts 
for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed. 
As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow 

large enough for a Medium creature to crouch 
within. You  can revert the cauldron to its normal 
size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that 
can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space. 
If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the 
cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of

(Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt 
it (no action required), if the creature is ever more 
than  1 5  feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo 
on a different creature. 

C ROOK OF RAO 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

Ages ago,  the  serene god Rao created a tool to 
shield  his fledgling faithful against the evils of the 
Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals devel­
oped their own methods of dealing with existential 
threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. I n  
recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was redis­
covered and leveraged against the rising power of 
the Witch Queen  Iggwilv (one of the  names of the 
wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv 
managed to damage the crook during the battle, in­
fecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential 
for future victory.  In the aftermath, the crook was 
again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the  famed 
artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the arti­
fact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using 
the Crook of Rao-potentially for the final time. 

Random Properties.  The artifact has the follow­
ing random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the  tables in  the  "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's  Guide: 

•  2 minor beneficial properties 
•  1  major beneficial property 

1  minor detrimental property

salt (which costs  1 0  gp) for a t  least 8 hours, the salt 
is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by 
raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this prop­
erty can't be used again for 7 days. 

C OILING GRASP TATTOO 
Wondrous item (tattoo),  uncommon (requires 
attunement) 

Produced by a special needle, this magic  tattoo  has 
long intertwining designs. 

Tattoo Attunement.  To  attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want  the  tat­
too to appear, pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 
Grasping  Tendrils.  While the tattoo is on your 
skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to ex­
trude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature 
you can see within  15 feet of you. The creature must 
succeed on a DC  14 Strength saving throw or take 
3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an 
action, the creature can escape the grapple by suc­
ceeding on a DC  14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity 

Destroying  or Repairing  the Crook.  The Crook 
of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by jour­
neying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from 
the eternally serene god Rao.  One way to  make the 
emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with 
the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revela­
tions beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook 
.  dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year 

and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the 
Crook loses its Failing Matrix property. 

C RYSTALLINE C H RONICLE 
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a 
wizard) 

An etched  crystal  sphere the  size of a grapefruit 
hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of 
inner light. While you are touching the crystal, 
you can retrieve and store information and spells 
within the crystal at the same rate as reading and 
writing. When found, the crystal contains the fol­
lowing spells: detect thoughts, intellect fortress,* 
Rary's  telepathic bond, sending, telekinesis, Tasha's 
mind whip,* and  Tenser's floating disk (spells with 
an asterisk appear in this book). It functions as a 

C R Y S T AL L I N E  

C H R O N I C L E  

SpelJs.  The  crook has 6 charges. While holding 
it, you can use an action to expend 1  or more of its 
charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 
1 8) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2
charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 
charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook 
regains  ld6  expended charges daily at dawn. 

Absolute Banishment.  While you are attuned to 
the crook and holding it, you can spend  10 minutes 
to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1  mile 
of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or 
higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent 
back to its home plane and can't return to the plane 
the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. 

Failing Matrix.  Whenever the Crook of Rao's Ab­
solute Banishment property is used, or when its last 
charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Rever­
sal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this 
effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 
60 feet of you and are not under your control.

lggwilv's  Curse. When the Crook was last used 
against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the 
artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, 
this curse has spread within the crook, threatening 
to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, 
the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is de­
stroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding 
into a SO-foot- diameter portal. This portal functions 
as a permanent gate spell cast by lggwilv. The gate 
then, once per round on initiative count  20, audibly 
speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so 
until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by 
the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn 
through the gate. This process takes eighteen years 
to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes 
a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of 
the Abyss.

spellbook for you, with its spells and  other writing 
psychically encoded within it. 

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it 
as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and 
you know the mage hand, mind sliver (appears in 
this book), and message can trips if you don't already 
know them. 

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains ld3 
expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the 
charges in the following ways while holding it: 

•  If you spend  1  minute studying the information 
within the crystal, you can expend 1  charge to 
replace one  of your prepared wizard spells with a 
different spell in the book. 

•  When you cast a wizard spell, you can expend 1 

charge to cast the  spell without verbal, somatic, or 
material components of up to  100 gp value. 

DEMONOMICON OF lGGWILV 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's in­
finite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of 
Jggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome 
of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts 
both the oldest and most current profanities of the 
Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to cen­
sor the text, and while sections have been ripped 
from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, 
ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds 
more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of 
script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which 
keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many 
pages are removed, and it longs to be more than 
mere reference material. 

Random Properties. The artifact has the follow 

random properties, which you can determine by 
rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the 
Dungeon Master's Guide: 

•  2 minor beneficial properties 
•  1  minor detrimental property 
•  1  major detrimental property 

Spells. The book has 8 charges. It regains  ld8 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, . 
you can  use an action to cast  Tasha's hideous laugh­
ter from it or to expend  1  or more  of its charges to 
cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: 
magic circle  (1  charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar 
ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane 
shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), sum­
mon fiend (3 charges; appears in this book). 

Abyssal Reference. You  can  reference  the Demo­
nomicon whenever you make an I ntelligence check 
to discern information about demons or a Wisdom 
(Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do 
so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to 
the  check.

Fiendish  Scourging.  Your magic causes pain to 
fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a 
damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you 
use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. 
Ensnarement.  While carrying the book, when­
ever you cast the magic circle spell naming only 
fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, 
the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level 
spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has 
disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell. 
Containment. The first  10 pages of the Demon­
omicon are blank. As an action while holding the 
book, you can target a fiend that you can see that 
is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must 
succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with 
disadvantage or become trapped within one of the 
Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills 
with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely 
known name and depravities. Once used,  this action 
can't be used again until the next dawn. 

When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demo­

nomicon are on the same  plane of existence, the 
trapped creature of the highest challenge rating 
within the book can attempt to possess you. You 
must make a DC  20 Charisma saving throw.  On a 
failure, you are possessed by the creature, which 
controls you like a puppet. The possessing crea­
ture can release you as an action, appearing in the 

C H A PT E R  3  I  M A G I C A L  M I S C E L L A N Y

closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the 
fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days. 

When the tome is discovered, it has l d4 fiends 

occupying its pages, typically an assortment 
of demons. 

Destroying  the Demonomicon.  To  destroy the 
book, six different demon lords must each tear out 
a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages 
reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours 
pass, a.nyone who opens the book's remaining bind­
ing is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss 
that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this 
deadly,  semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, 
Fraz- Urb'luu 's  Staff.  If the staff is dragged from  the 
pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and 
quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx,  the work 
that served as the foundation for the Demonomi-
. con. Once  the staff emerges, the demon  lord  Fraz­
Urb'luu instantly knows. 

DEVOTEE'S C ENSER 
Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric 
or paladin) 

The rounded head of this flail is perforated with tiny 
holes, arranged in symbols and patterns. The flail 
counts as a holy symbol for you. When you  hit with 
an attack using this magic flail, the target takes an 
extra  l d 8  radiant damage. 

D E V O T E E ' S   C E N S E R  

As a bonus action, you can speak the command 
word  to cause the flail  to emanate a thin cloud of in­
cense out to  1 0  feet for 1  minute. At the start of each 
of your turns, you and any other creatures in the in­
cense each regain  l d4 hit points. This property can't 
be used again until the next dawn. 

DUPLICITOUS MANUSCRIPT

While you are holding the book, you can use it as 

a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. 

The book has 3 charges, and it regains l d3 ex­
pended charges daily at dawn. You can use the 
charges in the following ways while holding it: 

If you spend  1  minute studying the book, you can 
expend  1  charge to replace one of your prepared 
wizard spells with a different spell in the book. 
The new spell must be of the illusion school. 
When a creature you can see makes an  Intelli­
gence (Investigation) check to discern the true 
nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a 
saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you 
can  use  your reaction and  expend  l  charge to im­
pose disadvantage on the roll.

Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their 
way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, 
souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an 
unsuspecting afterlife. 

Created by a figure of Vistani  legend, Luba's 
Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless 
heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also 
revealed great evils and guided its creator into the 
path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's 
creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, 
spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, 
not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most 
dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings 
of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning 
them within her tarroka deck. There these foul spir­
its dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden 
amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul­
as it inevitably will.

Prisoners of Fate.  Whenever you use the Twist of 
Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls 
trapped in the deck escapes. Roll dlOO and consult 
the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the 
high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You 
can find its  statistics in  the Monster Manual. If you 
roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.

The released soul appears at a random location 
within  lOdlO miles of you and terrorizes the living. 
Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the ben­
efit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, 
and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate 
suffer the effect of woe. 

Shuffling Fate.  If you go 7 days without using the 

Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's 
Tarroka of Souls ends, and you  can't attune to it 
again until after another creature uses Twist of 
Fate on you. 

Destroying  the Deck. Luba's  Tarokka of Souls 
can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within 
· are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth
soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which 
appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. 
If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card 
vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka 
deck, with no special  properties, but it includes a 
new card of the DM's design. 

LU BA'S  TAR O K K A   OF  S O U L S  

Like all tarokka decks, the  Tarokka of Souls is a

M OTHER LUBA AND THE VISTANI 
T h e  creator o f  t h e  Tarokka of Souls, M other L u b a  was 
one of the most influential leaders of the Vistan i .  For 
u ntol d  generations, the Vistan i  have wandered the 
Shadowfe l l ,  which includes terrifying demiplanes l i ke 
the vampire- h a u nted rea l m  of Barovia. These travelers 
have learned  many secrets of these domains and e n ­
cou ntered countless others wandering amid the Shad­
owfell 's horrors. M ost Vistan i  bands accept well-i nten­
tioned wayfarers from  d iverse walks and of d i s parate 
origin s ,  e mbracin g  any who seek to fi n d  a  home amid 
the e n d less roads and vistas hidden amid the mists. 

A  halfling Vistan i ,  Mother Luba led one of the largest 

groups ofVistani in the Shadowfe l l .  S h e  hailed from 
the  same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and 
Madam Eva came from ,  a n d  she created a commu n ity 
of kind ness and  resilience-ever rare to  find  in the 
Plane of Shadow.  She led  her people in welcoming 
strangers, feeding the h u n gry, a n d  defying the cruel. 
She a n d  Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam 
Eva began bargai n i ng with the creatures of the n ight. 
"We may wander amid the shadows," M other Luba 
said. " But we m ust ever serve as  a  l ight to o u r  fellow 
travelers." 

Some years ago,  Mother Luba disappeared i nto the 

mists, leaving behind o n l y  the Tarokka of Souls. It is 
said that if you d raw the M ists card from  it, you can 
hear the whispers of her kind voice. 

LYRE OF BUILDING 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a 
bard) 

While holding this lyre, you can cast mending as an 
action. You can also play the lyre as a reaction when 
an object or a structure you can see within  300 feet 
of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to 
that damage and any further damage of the same 
type until the start of your next turn. 

In addition, you can play the lyre as an action to 

cast fabricate, move earth, passwall, or summon 
construct (appears in this book), and that spell can't 
be cast from it again until the next dawn. 

MASQUERADE TATTOO 
Wondrous item (tattoo),  common (requires 
attunement) 

Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo ap­
pears on your body as whatever you desire. 

Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you 
hold the needle to your skin where you want the tat­
too to appear,  pressing the needle there throughout 
the attunement process. When the attunement is 
complete, the needle  turns into the ink that becomes 
the tattoo, which appears on the skin. 

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo 
vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. 

Fluid Ink. As a bonus action, you can shape the 
tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any 
area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is al­
ways obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no 
smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of 
art that covers all your skin. 

Disguise Self.  As an action, you can use the tat­
too to cast the disguise self spell (DC 1 3  to discern 
the disguise). Once the spell is cast from the tat­
too, it can't be cast from the  tattoo again until the 
next dawn. 

M IGHTY SERVANT OF LEUK- 0  
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

Named for the warlord who infamously employed 
it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically 
powerful,  10-foot-tall machine that turns into an an­
imate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming 
black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often 
described as a combination of a disproportioned 
dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains 
enough space for  1  ton of cargo and a crew compart­
ment within, from which up to two Medium crea­
tures can control it-and potentially execute a spree 
of unstoppable destruction. 

Tales of the servant's origins involve more con­
jecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly be­
ings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the 
supposedly related device known as the Machine 
of Lum  the Mad. The  best details on the device's 
origins and operation can be found in the Mind of 
Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the 
device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, 
and which was written by Lum the Mad's several 
times over granddaughter,  Lum the Maestro, while 
she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty 
Servant of Leuk-o. 

Dangerous Attunement.  Two creatures can be 
attuned to the  servant at a time. I f  a third creature 
tries to attune to it, nothing happens. 

The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in 

its upper back, which is easily opened while there 
are no creatures attuned to the artifact. 

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which 

can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during 
which time you must be inside the servant, interact­
ing with its controls. While crew members are at­
tuning themselves, any creature or structure outside 
and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent 
chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its 
Destructive Fist attacks once during the attune­
ment. This process must be undergone every time a 
creature attunes itself to the artifact.

While there are no attuned creatures inside the 

servant, it is an inert object. 

Ghost in  the Machine.  Upon his death, the soul 
of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the 
artifact and has become its animating force. The 
servant has been known to attack or move of its own 
accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruc­
tion. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's 
discretion, takes one action while uncrewed. 

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, 
each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20

Immutable Existence. The servant is  immune to any spell or 
effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of 
existence. 

Magic Resistant Construction. The servant has advantage on 
saving throws against spel ls and other magical effects, and 
spell attacks made against it have d isadvantage. 

Regeneration. The servant regains  10 hit points at the start of 
its turn. If it is  reduced to 0 hit points, this trait doesn't func· 
tion  u ntil an attuned creature spends 24 hours repairing the 
artifact or u ntil the artifact is subjected to lightning damage. 

Standing Leap. The servant's long jump is up to 50 feet and its 
high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start. 

Unusual Nature. The servant doesn't req uire air, food, 
drink, or sleep. 

ACTI O N S  
Destructive Fist.  Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +1 7 to hit, 
reach  10 ft. or range 1 20 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d1 2  +  1 0) 
force damage.  If the  target is an  object, it takes triple damage. 

Crushing Leap.  I f  the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of 
its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet i n  a 
space  that contains one or more other creatures.  Each  of those 
creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the 
servant and m ust make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a 
failed  save,  a creature takes  26 (4d12)  bludgeoning damage and 
is knocked  prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as 
much damage and isn't knocked  prone. 

M 1 G H T V   S E R V A N T  O F  L E U K · O  

Controlling  the Servant. While any creatures are 

attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open 
the hatch as easily as any other door. Other crea­
tures can open the hatch as an action with a suc­
cessful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. 
A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until 
the start of the caster's next turn. 

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by 
spending  10 feet of movement. Those inside the ser­
vant have total cover from effects originating outside 
it. The controls within it allow creatures to see out­
side without obstruction. 

While you are inside the servant, you can com­
mand it by using the controls. During your turn (for 
either attuned creature), you can command it in the 
following ways: 

•  Open or close the hatch (no action required, 

once per turn) 

•  Move the servant up to its speed (no ac­

tion required) 

•  As an action, you can command the servant to 
take one of the actions in its stat block or some 
other action. 

•  When a creature provokes an opportunity attack 
from the servant, you can use your reaction to 
command the servant to make one Destructive 
Fist attack against that creature.

you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the

NATURE'S MANTLE 
Wondrous item,  uncommon (requires attunement by 
a druid or ranger) 

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend  with the 
terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, 
you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid 
and ranger spells. 

While you are in an area that is lightly obscured, 
you can Hide as a bonus action even if you are being 
directly observed. 

OUTER E S SENCE SHARD 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a 
sorcerer) 

This flickering crystal  holds the essence of an Outer 
Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a 
Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) 
or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. 
You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while 
you hold or wear it. 

Roll a d4 and consult the Outer Essence Shards 
table to determine the shard's essence and property. 

N A T U R E ' S   M A N T L E  

Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. 
While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a 
destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and 
attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the 
servant, starting with those threatening the arti­
fact-preferably using the servant, if possible. 

Self-Destruct.  By inputting a specific series of 
lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two 
crew members can cause it to explode. The self-de­
struct code is not revealed to crew members when 
they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered 
(the DM determines how), it requires two attuned 
crew members to be inside the servant and spend 
their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing 
the command. Should the crew members begin the 
process of entering the code, though, the servant 
uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns 
the crew members against each other. 

If the crew members successfully implement the 

code, at the end of the third  round, the servant ex­
plodes. Every creature in a  1 00-foot-radius sphere 
centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dex­
terity saving throw.  On a failed  save, a creature 
takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning 
damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a suc­
cessful save, a creature takes half as much damage. 
Objects and structures in the area take triple dam­
age. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly 
and leave behind no remains. 

This does not destroy the servant permanently. 
Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, 
right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso­
drop from the sky in random places within 1 ,000 
miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet 
of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform 
the servant. 

Destroying  the Servant.  The servant can be 
destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, 
its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one 
of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. 
Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of 
Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption 
that is three times the size and three times the dam­
age as the servant's self-destruct property. 

MOON SICKLE 
Weapon (sickle),  uncommon (+1),  rare (+2),  very rare

This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moon­
light. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a

bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity. In addi­
tion, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus 
for your druid and ranger spells.

TEETH OF DAHLVER-NAR 
Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement) 

The  Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. 
They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of 
wildly different origins and made from various ma­
terials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, 
stitched with images of heroes and whimsical crea­
tures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life. 

Using the  Teeth.  While you are holding the 
pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. 
Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to deter­
mine which tooth you draw, and you can either 
sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are de­
scribed later). 

If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at 
the end of your turn.  On an even number, the tooth 
vanishes, and creatures  appear as if you sowed the 
tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On 
an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth 
as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another 
implanted tooth, see below). 

Each tooth  can  only be used once. Track which 
teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled af­
ter it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused 
tooth on the table. 

C H A P T E R   3  I  M A G I C A L  M I S C E L L A N Y  

135 

Sowing  Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on 

the ground in an unoccupied space within your 
reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space 
within  10 feet of you in a body of water that is at 
least SO feet wide and SO feet long. Upon doing so, 
the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, 
leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. 
The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned 
column appear in an unoccupied space as close to 
where the tooth was sown as possible. The crea­
tures are allies to you, speak all languages you 
speak, and linger for  10  minutes before disappear­
ing, unless otherwise noted. 

Implanting  Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place 

it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth 
falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resiz­
ing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, 
you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect col­
umn. The tooth can't be removed while you are at­
tuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your 
attunement to them. If removed after your death, the 

tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number 
of the teeth implanted at one time equal to  1  + your
Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). I f  
you try t o  implant more teeth, the newly implanted 
tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined 
randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose 
the implanted effect. 

Recovering  Teeth.  Once all the teeth have van­
ished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with 
all the teeth then appears in a random destination, 
which could be on a different world of the Mate­
rial Plane. 

Destroying  the Teeth.  Each tooth must be de­
stroyed individually by sowing it in the area where 
the tooth's story originated, with the intention to 
destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures sum­
moned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. 
Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in 
search of home, while others act as their tales dic­
tate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

D UNGEON MASTER'S TOOLS 

HE DUNGEON MASTER EMPLOYS  MANY 
tools when preparing and running a D&D 
campaign. As a DM, your tools include 
your imagination, your ability to discern 
what entertains your players, your storytelling acu­
men, your sense of humor, your ability to listen well, 
your facility with the game's rules, and more. This 
chapter adds to your toolbox with guidance and op­
tional rules for a variety of situations. The chapter 
also includes a selection of ready-to-use puzzles, 
which you can drop into any campaign. 

The tools herein build on the material in the 

Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual. 
You may use some, all, or none of these  tools, and 
feel free to customize how they work. Your group's 
enjoyment is paramount, so make these rules your 
own, aiming to match your group's tastes.

TA�llA 

Before making characters or playing the game, the 
DM and players can run a special session-colloqui­
ally called session zero-to establish expectations, 
outline the terms of a social contract, and share 
house rules. Making and sticking to these rules can 
help ensure that the game is a fun experience for 
everyone involved. 

Often a session zero includes building characters 

together. As the DM, you can help players during 
the character creation process by advising them to 
select options that will serve the  adventure or cam­
paign that awaits. 

CHARACTER AND  PARTY  CREATION 

Each player has  options when it comes to choosing 
a character race, class, and background, though you 
may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuit­
able for the campaign.  If there are multiple players 
in the group, yo� should encourage them to choose 
different classes so that the adventuring party has 
a range of abilities. It's less important that the party 
include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it's 
fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adven­
turing entertainers. The backgrounds they choose 
define who their characters were before becoming 

adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in 
the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws-things you 
ought to know. For example, if a player chooses 
the criminal background, one of the options for the 
character's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debt 
I owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the charac­
ter's bond, you should work with the player to decide 
who that generous benefactor is and build relevant 
storylines into the larger campaign. 

PARTY FORMATION 
During session zero, your role is to let the players 
build the characters they want and to help them 
come up with explanations for how their charac­
ters came together to form an adventuring party. It 
can be helpful to assume that the characters know 
each other and have some sort of history together, 
however brief that history might be.  Here are some 
questions you can ask the players as they create 
characters to get a sense of the party's relationships: 

•  Are any of the characters related to each other? 
•  What  keeps the characters together as a party? 
•  What does each character like  most about every 

other member of the adventuring party? 

•  Does the  group have a patron? See chapter 2, 

"Group Patrons," for patron examples. 

If the players are having trouble coming up with a 
story for how their characters met, they may choose 
an option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 roll 
choose it for them. You should spend part of session 
zero helping the players flesh out the details. For ex­
ample, if the characters came together to overcome 
a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to 
be determined. If a funeral  gathered the group,  the 
identity of the deceased and each character's rela­
tionship to them will need to be fleshed out.

RUNNING A GAM E  FOR ONE PLAYER 
A DM running a game for one player should spend 
part of session zero working with that player to 
come up with their character's backstory, then 
let the player decide if they want the character to 
have a sidekick (see the "Sidekicks" section in 
this chapter). 

You might  need to help the player run the sidekick 

for the first few sessions and should make sure the 
player understands the functions and limitations of 
sidekicks: 

•  Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can per­
form tasks both in and out of combat, including 
things such as setting up camp and carrying gear. 

•  Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should comple­
ment those of the main character. For exam­
ple, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a 
fighter or rogue. 

SOCIAL  CONTRACT 

D&D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all 
experience. If one or more participants aren't hav­
ing fun,  the  game won't last long. Session zero is 
the perfect time for you and the  players to discuss 
the experience they're hoping for, as well as topics, 
themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Out 
of this discussion, a social contract begins to form. 
Sometimes a social contract takes shape organi­
cally, but it's good practice to have a direct conver­
sation during session zero to establish boundaries 
and expectations. A typical social contract in a D&D 
group includes implicit or explicit commitments to 
the following points: 

•  You will respect the players by running a game 

that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will al­
low every player to contribute to the ongoing story 
and give every character moments to shine. When 
a player is talking, you are listening. 

•  The players will respect you and the effort it takes 
to create a fun game for everyone. The players will 
allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the 
rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking, 
the players are listening. 

1 4 0  

C H A PT E R  4  I  D U N G E O N   M A STE R ' S  TOOLS 

•  The players will respect one another, listen to one 
another, support one another, and do their utmost 
to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party. 

•  Should you or a player disrespect each other or 

violate the social contract in some other way, the 
group may dismiss that person from the table. 

This social contract covers the basics, but indi-
vidual groups might require additional agreed-upon 
terms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. And 
a social contract typically evolves as a group's mem­
bers learn more about one another. 

HARD AND SOFT LIMITS 
Once you and the players have acknowledged the 
terms of the game's social contract and agreed to 
uphold them, the conversation can segue into a dis­
cussion about soft and hard limits. There are many 
ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want 
to do some research to find an approach that might 
work well for your group. For purposes of this expla­
nation, these terms are described as follows: 

A soft limit is a threshold that one should think 

twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genu­
ine anxiety, fear, and discomfort. 

A hard limit is a threshold that should never 

be crossed. 

Every member of the group has soft and hard lim­
its, and it behooves everyone in the group to know 
what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is 
comfortable with how this discussion takes place. 
Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud 
around the table, especially if they're new to role­
playing games or haven't spent a lot of time with 
certain other members of the group. One way to 
alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players 
to share their limits privately with you and allow 
you to present them without attribution to the whole 
group. For example, the players could write their 
limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However 
these limits are presented, it would be useful for you 
or one of the players to compile the limits into one 
list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep 
in mind that any discussion about limits should be 
treated with care-even sharing a person's limits 
can be a very painful experience, and this conversa­
tion should be handled with respect. 

Common in-game limits include-but are not lim­
ited to-themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial 
profiling, slavery, violence toward children and ani­
mals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance. 
Common out-of-game limits include unwanted phys­
ical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, 
vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell 
phones, and generally disrespectful behavior. 

The discussion of limits is important because 
DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that 
others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or 
theme that makes a member of the gaming group 
feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a 
topic or theme makes one or more players nervous 
but they give you consent to include it in-game,  in­
corporating it should be handled with care, and you 
must be ready to veer away from such topics and 
themes quickly. 

While session zero  is the perfect place to start this 

discussion, it might not be the only time limits are 
addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to 
be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think 
to include some of their limits in the initial discus­
sion. Players can also discover new limits as the 
campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the 
group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits 
is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list 
often in case it changes. 

GAME  CUSTOMIZATION 

In addition to shaping the game around  the char­
acters in the adventuring party, you should be 
prepared to customize the game to suit the players' 
tastes. The "Know Your Players" section in the  in­
troduction of the Dungeon Master's Guide provides 
some guidance for doing so, based on known player 
archetypes. To help identity what types of players 
are in the group, you can ask each player any or all 
of the following questions: 

•  Which of the three pillars of adventuring (combat, 
exploration, roleplaying) interest you the most? 

•  How much humor do you like in the game? 
•  What level of technology do you prefer? 
•  Do you enjoy solving in-game puzzles and riddles? 
•  Do you like to track experience points, or would 
you rather have your character advance in level 
when I tell you to? 

HOUSE RULES 
House rules include optional rules, such as those 
presented in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's 
Guide, and rules you create.  If you plan to use any 
house rules, session zero is a good time to discuss 
those rules with the players and solicit their input. 
House rules are best presented as experiments, 
and time will tell if they're good for your game. If 
you introduce a house rule in session zero that 
turns out to have an adverse effect on people's en­
joyment of the game, you may jettison or revise the 
house rule to create a better gaming experience for 
everyone. Don't feel bad if a house rule doesn't end 
up working as well as you expected it to. Remember: 
the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.

TA�HA' 

This section provides a straightforward way to add 
a special NPC-called a sidekick-to the group of 
adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low 
challenge rating and give it levels in one of three 
simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior. 
A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at 
the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them 
during the campaign. For example, the characters 
might meet a villager, an animal, or another crea­
ture, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to 
join them on their adventures. 

You can also use these rules to customize a mon­

ster for your own use as DM. 

CREATING  A  SIDEKICK 

A sidekick can be  any type of creature with a stat 
block in the Monster Manual or another  D&D book, 
but the challenge rating in its stat block must be  1/2 
or lower. You take that stat block and add to it, as ex­
plained in the "Gaining a Sidekick Class" section. 
To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the 
friend of at least one of them. This friendship might 
be connected to a character's backstory or to events 
that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick 
could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a 
creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you deter­
mine whether there is sufficient trust  established for 
the creature to join the group. 

You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are 

some options: 

•  A player plays the sidekick as their second charac­
ter-ideal when you have only one or two players. 

•  A player plays the sidekick as their only char­

acter-ideal for a player who wants a character 
who's simpler than a typical player character. 

•  The players jointly play the sidekick. 
•  You play the sidekick. 

There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a 
group, but having more than one per player charac­
ter can noticeably slow down the game. And when 
estimating the difficulty of an upcoming encounter, 
count each sidekick as a character. 

GAINING  A  SIDEKICK  CLASS 

When you create a sidekick, you choose the class 
it will have for the rest of its career: Expert, Spell­
caster, or Warrior, each of which is detailed below. 
If a sidekick class contains a choice, you may make 
the  choice or let the players make it. 

STARTING LEVEL 
The starting level of a sidekick is the same as the 
average level of the group. For example, if a  1 st-level 
group starts out with a sidekick, that sidekick is also 
1 st level, but if a  10th-level group invites a sidekick 
to join them, that sidekick starts at  10th level. 

LEVELING UP A SIDEKICK 
Whenever a group's average level goes up, the side­
kick gains a level. It doesn't matter how much of the 
group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced; 
the sidekick levels up because of a combination 
of the adventures it shared with the group and its 
own training. 

HIT POINTS 
Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit 
Die, and its hit point maximum increases. To  deter­
mine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die 
(the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block), 
and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a mini­
mum of 1  hit point per level. 

If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn't killed 

outright, it falls unconscious and subsequently 
makes death saving throws, just like a player 
character. 

PROFICI ENCY BONUS 
The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by 
its  level in  its class, as  shown in  the class's table. 
Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus in­
creases by 1 ,  add  1  to the to-hit modifier of all the 
attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its 
stat block by 1 .  

ABILITY SCORE INCREASES 
Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Im­
provement feature, adjust anything in its stat block 
that relies on an ability modifier that you increase. 
For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses 
its Strength modifier, increase the attack's mod­
ifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier 
increases. 

If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat 

block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can 
use either. 

EXPERT 

The Expert is a master of certain tasks or knowl­
edge, favoring cunning over brawn. It might be a 
scout, a musician, a librarian, a clever street kid, a 
wily merchant, or a burglar. 

To gain  the Expert class, a creature must have at 
least one language in its stat block that it can speak. 
A sidekick gains the following class features as it 

gains levels, as summarized on the Expert table.

4th-level Expert feature 

At 4th level and again at 8th, 1 0th, 1 2th, 16th, and 
19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two abil­
ity scores of your choice by  1. The sidekick can't in­
crease an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

COORDINATED STRIKE 
6th-level Expert feature 

The sidekick is adept at fighting in concert with a 
companion. When the sidekick uses its Helpful fea­
ture to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target 
can be up to 30 feet away from the sidekick, and the 
sidekick can  deal an extra 2d6 damage to it the next 
time the sidekick hits it with an attack roll before 
the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the 
same type of damage dealt by the attack. 

EVASION 
7th-level Expert feature 

Because of extraordinary good luck,  the sidekick 
is skilled at avoiding danger. When the sidekick 
is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a 
Dexterity saving throw to take  only half damage, it 
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving 
throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick 
doesn't benefit from this feature while incapacitated. 

INSPIRING HELP 
1 1th-level Expert feature 

When the sidekick takes the Help action, the crea­
ture who receives the help also gains a  ld6 bonus to 
the d20 roll.  If that roll is an attack  roll,  the creature 
can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the 
attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the 
attack's damage roll against one target. 

At  20th level, the bonus increases to 2d6. 

RELIABLE TALENT 
14th-level Expert feature 

The sidekick has refined its  skills to an  exceptional 
degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability 
check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it 
can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a  10. 

SHARP MIND 
18th-level Expert feature 

The sidekick gains proficiency in one of the follow­
ing saving throws of your choice: Intelligence, Wis­
dom, or Charisma.

person with  magic in their veins. 

To  gain the Spellcaster class, a creature must 
have at least one language in its stat block that it 
can speak. 

A sidekick gains the following class features as 
it gains levels in this class, as summarized on the 
Spellcaster table.

The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor, 
and  if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial 
weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency 
with all simple weapons. 

SPELLCASTING 
1st-level Spellcaster feature 

The sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the 
creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this fea­

in the Spells Known column must be of a level for 
which  the  sidekick has spell slots, as  shown on  the 
table. For instance, when the sidekick reaches 5th 
level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or 
2nd level. 

Additionally, when the sidekick gains a level in 
this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows 
from  this class and replace it with another spell 
from its spell list. The new spell must be a cantrip 
or of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots. 

Spellcasting Ability.  The sidekick's spellcasting 

ability for these spells depends on the choice you 
made on the  Spellcasting table. 

The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever 

a spell refers to that ability.  In addition, it  uses its 
spellcasting ability modifier when  setting the saving 
throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an 
attack roll with one. 

Spell save DC = 8 +  sidekick's proficiency bon us + 
spellcasting ability modifier 
Spell attack modifier = sidekick's  proficiency bon u s + 
s pellcasting a b i l ity modifier 

Spellcasting Focus. The sidekick can use a focus 

for its spells depending on the choice you made on 
the Spellcasting table. A Mage can use an arcane 
focus, a Priest can use a holy symbol, and a Prodigy 
can use an arcane focus or a musical instrument. 

ABILITY SCORE IM PROVEMENT 
4th-level Spellcaster feature 

At 4th level and  again at 8th,  1 2th,  16th, and  1 8th 
level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability 
scores of your choice by  1. The sidekick can't in­
crease an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

POTENT CANTRIPS 
6th-level Spellcaster feature 

The  sidekick can add  its spellcasting ability modifier 
to the damage it deals with any cantrip. 

EM POWERED SPELLS 
14th-level Spellcaster feature 

Choose one school of magic. Whenever the sidekick 
casts a spell of that school by expending a spell slot, 
the sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier 
to the spell's damage roll or healing roll, if any. 

FOCUSED CASTING 
20th-level Spellcaster feature 

Taking damage can't break the sidekick's concentra­
tion on a spell. 

WARRIOR 

A Warrior sidekick grows in martial prowess as 
it fights by your side. It might be a soldier, a town 
guard, a battle-trained beast, or any other creature 
honed for combat. 

A sidekick gains the following class features as 
it  gains levels in this class, as summarized on the 
Warrior table. 

BONUS PROFICIENCIES 
1st-level Warrior feature 

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw 
of your choice: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. 
In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two 

skills of your choice from the  following list: Acro­
batics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, 
Nature, Perception, and Survival. 

The sidekick gains proficiency with all armor, 
and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial 
weapon in its stat block, it gains proficiency with 
shields and all simple and martial weapons. 

MARTIAL ROLE 
1st-level Warrior feature 

Each warrior focuses on offense or defense in their 
training. Choose one of the following options: 

Attacker. The sidekick gains a +2  bonus to all 

attack rolls. 

Defender. The sidekick can use its reaction to im­

pose disadvantage on the attack roll of a creature 
within 5 feet of it whose target isn't the sidekick, 
provided the sidekick can see the attacker. 

SECOND WIND 
2nd-level Warrior feature 

The sidekick can  use a bonus  action  on  its turn  to 
regain hit  points equal to  1 d 1 0  + its level  in this 
class. Once it uses this feature, it must finish a short 
or long rest before it can use it again. 

The sidekick can use this feature twice between 

rests starting at  20th level. 

IM PROVED C RITICAL 
3rd-level  Warrior feature 

The sidekick's attack rolls score a critical hit on a 
roll of 1 9  or 20 on the d20. 

ABI LITY SCORE IM PROVEMENT 
4th-level Warrior feature 

At 4th level and again at 8th,  1 2th,  14th,  1 6th, and 
1 9th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two abil­
ity scores of your choice by 1 .  The sidekick can't in­
crease an ability score above 20 using this feature.

use Extra Attack or Multiattack on a turn, not both.

7th-level Warrior feature 

The sidekick has advantage  on initiative rolls. 

IMPROVED DEFENSE 
10th-level Warrior feature 

The sidekick's Armor  Class increases by  1 .

but it must use the new roll. When it uses this fea­
ture,  it can't use the feature again until it finishes a 
long rest. 

The sidekick can use this feature twice between 

long rests starting at 1 8th level.

Meeting a monster doesn't have to spark a fight. An 
offering, like food, can calm some hostile monsters, 
and sapient creatures often prefer to talk than to 
draw weapons. If the adventurers try to parley with 
a monster, you may improvise the encounter or use 
the social interaction rules in the Dungeon Master's 
Guide. Consider granting the characters advantage 
on any ability check they make to communicate 
with a creature if they offer something it wants. The 
"Monsters' Desires" section below suggest things 
that a creature might like, depending on its type. 

MONSTER  RESEARCH 

Adventurers can research what a creature is likely 
to desire. The Monster Research table suggests 
which skills can be used to learn about a creature of 
a particular type.  The DC for a relevant ability check 
equals  10 + the creature's challenge rating.

TA�HA 

B L E S S E D  RA D I A N C E  EF FECTS 

This section explores how to add fantastical chal­
lenges to any locale and ways to further bring an 
adventure's setting to life. 

When a creature's name appears in bold in a table 
herein, that indicates that you can find the creature's 
stat block in the Monster Manual. 

SU PERNATURAL REGIONS 

Not all lands thrive  as nature intended. Magical 
forces, strange interlopers, or tragic events can alter 
an area's destiny, fundamentally changing the land. 
While the flora, fauna, structures, and inhabitants 
might remain unaffected, the land's innate character 
takes on new qualities. 

A supernatural region is permeated by a preter­

natural force in an area as large or small as you 
wish. In the affected area, certain effects and brief 
encounters reinforce an underlying theme. These 
effects occur as characters traverse an influenced 
region or add interest to a specific affected location. 
The descriptions of the following supernatural 
regions summarize the region, present a table of 
potential effects within the affected area, and note 
triggers for a random effect. Feel free to customize 
the effects of each region to suit any adventure.

•  When a creature activates a magic item 
•  When a creature makes an exceptionally loud 

noise or otherwise attracts attention 
When the party spends at least 30 minutes in the

The sword d eals radiant damage instead of 

slashing damage and  knows the exact location 

of its target while the target is within the re­

gion. The sword vanishes when i.t or its target 
is  reduced to 0 h it points.

FAR REALM 
As souls travel away from the Material Plane after 
death, they either dwell in the Astral  Plane as spir­
its or are pulled toward one of the Outer Planes to 
continue their journey. But some entities find ways 
to travel  beyond the Outer Planes to dwell in the 
Far Realm. There they transform over eons into 
abominations or elder evils, seething in a reality 
with its own laws. All who stay in the Far Realm are 
eventually twisted into alien shapes by the realm's 
eldritch forces. 

The Far Realm's pernicious influence is often 

subtle, leaking into the Material Plane through thin 
places in reality or as invasive thoughts that inspire 
life to propagate along alien paths. 

Consider rolling on the Far Realm Effects table 
when the following circumstances occur in a region 
touched by the Far Realm: 

•  A warlock whose Otherworldly Patron is a Great 
Old One rolls a  1  or 20 on the d20 for an ability 
check, an attack roll, or a saving throw. 
•  The characters take  a short or long rest in 

the region. 

•  A creature spends more than an hour reading an 
eldritch tome written by those who have seen or 
otherwise interacted with  the Far Realm.

Haunted environs include homes burdened by dark 
deeds, the sites of mass killings, and locations 
where individuals died while  experiencing powerful 
fear, sorrow, or hatred. Haunted places  bear echoes 
of the past and, like ghosts, harass visitors even as 
they seek respite from age-old traumas. Few places 
are meaninglessly haunted, and you can easily cus­
tomize the general results on the following table to 
suit all manner of macabre tales.

I NFESTED 
On many worlds, the biomass of insects radically 
outweighs that of higher organisms. Mass migra­
tions and deadly insect species can imperil larger 
creatures, but most insects remain nothing more 
than an annoyance. However, through wild popu­
lation booms, magical manipulation, supernatural 
growth, interbreeding with otherworldly species, or 
stranger circumstances, insects can overrun an en­
tire region. Swarms of insects become the dominant 
species in an area, consuming plants and animals, 
creating elaborate hives or tunnels, and infesting 
structures and the earth. 

The following effects represent a region overrun 

by insects or hives of similar creatures, likely ma­
nipulated by magic, otherworldly intelligence, or 
environmental factors to infest an area in countless 
numbers and drive out all competing life. 

Consider rolling on the I nfested Effects ta­
ble when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 

•  Webs, cocoons, hives, anthills, or other insect 

dwellings are disturbed. 

•  A creature attacks an insect swarm or a Small or

UNRAVELING MAGIC 
The source of magic is damaged or corrupted in this 
region. Magic is unpredictable, and strange results 
occur when a creature casts a spell. Such regions 
come into being when potent rituals go awry (or if 
they succeed, in the case of dangerous and destruc­
tive undertakings), in the aftermath of cataclysmic 
magical battles, or where an artifact was destroyed. 
Consider rolling on the Unraveling Magic Effects 

table when the following circumstances occur in 
the region: 

•  Any charges are expended in a magic item. 
•  A spell slot of 1st level or higher is expended. 
•  A dragon, a fey, or an elemental of challenge rating 

5 or higher dies.

Magic has the ability to make even the most serene 
natural settings unpredictable. Whether the result 
of magical calamities, otherworldly influences, or 
nexuses of inexplicable forces, the subsequent ef­
fects range from whimsical to deadly. 

ELDRITCH STORMS 
When magical currents become trapped amid 
winds and clouds, eldritch storms can result. 
Flaywind.  Supernaturally powerful winds-
like those from planes such as Pandemonium or 
Minethys, the third layer of Carceri-can spawn 
flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, 
gathering large rocks and other debris in addition 
to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily 
obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 
ld4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. 
Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection 
against the flensing grit. 

A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its 
wake. A successful DC  1 5  Intelligence (Arcana) or 
(Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows 
a character to recognize a flaywind  1  minute before 
it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind 
typically lasts  ld4  x  10 hours. 

Flame Storm.  Sooty thunderclouds shot through 

with red and orange lightning release a deluge of 
fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning 
rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of 
its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects 
that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the 
droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, 
crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvan­
tage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and ranged 
attack rolls. 

A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though 

the originating storm clouds can persist for days, 
creating multiple flame storms. 

Necrotic  Tempest. Storms infused with the es­
sence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest 
leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any crea­
ture exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or 
an undead must succeed on a DC  1 3  Constitution 
saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 
necrotic damage. 

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises 
as a skeleton or zombie (your choice) ldlO min­
utes later. 

A necrotic tempest lasts for  ld4 hours and leaves 
crops withered and wells undrinkable for  ld4 days 
after its passing. 

Thrym 's Howl.  These bone-chilling blizzards 
drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. 
The storm projects extreme cold (see the Dungeon 
Master's Guide). Due  to the howling wind and 
dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm 

C HA P T E R  4  I  D U N G E O N   M A S T E R ' S  TOOLS 

1 6 3  

is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and 
Wisdom (Perception) checks made within it have 
disadvantage. 

Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of 
its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can't regain hit 
points until it spends at least  1  hour in a warm en­
vironment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes 
solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage 
are immune to the effects of the storm and can see 
normally within it. 

Thrym's howl typically lasts 2d10 hours. 

E MOTIONAL ECHOES 
Occasionally a place becomes infused with the pow­
erful emotions of those who once dwelt, worked, 
celebrated, or suffered there. Areas with emotional 
echoes are typically associated with one common 
emotion, such as joy or sorrow. Such an area might 
be as small as a room in a house or as large as a 
forest.  Once per day,  if a creature within the area 
expresses even the faintest hint of the prevailing 
emotion, the land seeks to hold onto that creature 
and inspire it to produce more of the feeling tied to 
the emotional echo. The creature is targeted by a 
suggestion spell (DC 16), with  the intent of making 
it linger in the area and perform an act related to its 
associated emotion. The effect lasts 24 hours. 

The following list notes some of the most common 

emotional echoes, where they tend t.o appear, and 
how they typically influence creatures: 

Boldness: Appears in battlefields and echoing 

canyons, encouraging creatures to shout hidden 
truths and act out their greatest victories 

Doubt: Appears around cliffs or deserts and makes 

creatures hesitate, mistrusting their ability to 
climb or escape their current difficulties 

Fear: Appears in caves and ruins, overwhelming 
creatures with dread and urging them to give 
voice to their deepest fears 

Hatred: Appears in volcanic regions and provokes 

creatures to scream  and destroy things 

Inspiration: Appears around memorials or natural 
wonders, causing creatures to create works of art 
on the spot and obsess over them 

Joy: Appears in glens or flowering fields, inspiring 

creatures to dance, relax, and sing 

Love: Appears along beaches or orchards and en­

courages creatures to confess their love to others 
and endlessly list their favorite things 

Sorrow: Appears in ruins and swamps, particularly 

around quicksand, and overwhelms creatures 
with sobbing and confessions of regret

ENCHANTED SPRINGS 
Enchanted springs brim with miraculous waters, 
whether they tap into magical sources hidden be­
neath the earth or they're blessed by eldritch beings. 
Those who find these mystical sites might bathe or 
drink from the pools and temporarily gain a mea­
sure of the waters' magic. All manner of protectors 
or covetous guardians might lurk around these 
springs, driving off strangers or demanding a wor­
thy price for access to the mystical waters. 

While many enchanted springs bear the blessings 

of wild gods or fey beings, some are tainted. These 
might be waters that were long ago polluted by the 
ichor of an evil entity. As with pristine enchanted 
springs, folk seek out such defiled places, whether 
to purify them or claim their foul powers. 

Regardless of whether a spring is pure or tainted, 

creatures might need to drink the water to experi­
ence the spring's effects, simply touch the water, or 
bathe in it for a minute to trigger an effect. 

Bottling an enchanted spring's water removes its 
magical properties, unless the bottle is a specially 
prepared vial blessed by whatever being enchanted 
the spring in the first place.

MAGIC MUSH ROOMS 
Mushrooms can be deadly, delicious, or both. Some 
have magical properties, especially those that grow 
in areas suffused by mystical energy,  such as the 
Underdark and the Feywild. 

Creatures proficient in the Medicine, Nature, or 

Survival skills might be versed on the subject of 
fungi, especially the magical kind, since the benefi­

But when an unknown variety of fungus is encoun­

MIMIC C OLON IES 
Mimics imitate terrain and dungeon dressing to 
hunt for food. Rare specimens develop a deeper un­
derstanding of the world and can communicate with 
other creatures. In extremely rare cases, groups of 
these creatures band together, creating colonies. 
These bonded mimics cooperate to create larger 
objects than any lone mimic could approximate. A 
mimic colony can work together to form buildings, 
bridges, crystal formations, cliff faces, statues, and 
nearly anything it desires. Entire villages appearing 
out of nowhere might be composed of mimics! 

Mimic  Communication.  Members of the colony 

develop telepathy and the ability to speak. While 
within 10 miles of the colony, any mimic can com­
municate telepathically with other creatures within 
1 20 feet of it and can speak Common and Under­
common fluently (or two other languages of the 
DM's choice). The colony's offspring gain these abil­
ities innately and can use them even away from the 
colony, as shown in the juvenile Mimic stat block. 

Confronting a Colony.  A mimic colony's primary 
goal is survival: If threatened by a force the mimics 
can't overcome, they are willing to bargain. Mimic 
colonies have learned that adventurers they can't de­
feat can be bought off with information about nearby 
creatures or locations, hidden treasure (which the 
colony obtained from prior "food"), or even one of 
their own young.

ing u pside down on cei l ings, without needing to make an 
ability check. 

ACTI O N S  
Bite.  Melee  Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach  5 ft., one target. 
Hit: l  piercing damage  plus  2 (l d4) acid damage. 

Shape-Shift. The mimic polymorphs i nto an object or back 
into its true, amorphous form.  Its statistics are the same in 
each form. Any equ ipment it is wearing or carrying isn't trans­
formed .  It reverts to its true form if it d ies.

If the colony's survival is threatened and it thinks 
it has a chance of surviving a fight, it can leverage its 
combined  might using special  lair actions. On initia­
tive count 20 (losing all ties), the mimic colony takes 
a lair action, causing one of the following effects; it 
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

•  The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures 

within 300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on 
a DC  15 Strength saving throw or have its speed 
reduced to 0 until initiative count 20 on the follow­
ing round, as pieces of the environment grasp the 
target. If a target fails the save by 5 or more, it is 
restrained instead for that duration. 

•  The mimic colony uses the Help action, aiding a 

creature of its choice within 300 feet of it. 

•  The mimic colony chooses up to three creatures 

within  300 feet of it. Each target must succeed on 
a DC  15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) 
acid damage, as orifices appear on surfaces in the 
environment and launch caustic spittle. 

•  The mimic colony chooses a cube of nonmagical, 

inanimate material in physical contact with it. The 
cube can be up to 1 5  feet on a side. The colony re­
shapes that material however it likes. This trans­
formation lasts for 1  hour. 

When determining the difficulty of an encounter 
with a hostile  mimic colony, consider the colony to 
be one additional creature of challenge rating 2. 

PRIMAL FRUIT 
In wild places brimming with nature's power, gar­
dens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and 
blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants 
can sometimes produce fruit bursting with primal 
magic. Not every fruit-bearing plant holds this 
stored magic, but those that do bear obvious signs: 
their colors are more vibrant or shift randomly, their 
skin sparkles in the light or glows in the dark, soft 
hums emanate from them, or they feel peculiar to 
the touch. 

A fruit-bearing plant that is suffused with magic 

might produce ld6 pieces of primal fruit every 
week. Primal fruit remains potent for 1  week, 
after which it loses its magical properties but re­
mains edible. 

As an action, a creature can eat a piece of primal 

fruit to gain its effects. This fruit can be squeezed 
into juice or cooked into a dish and retains its 
magic.  Choose an effect or roll on the Primal Fruit 
Effects table to determine what happens when a 
piece of the fruit is consumed. An identify spell or 
similar magic reveals the beneficial effect of a piece 
of fruit before it is eaten, but it doesn't reveal a curse 
or side effect.

UNEARTHLY ROADS 
Currents of magic run through the world-invisible, 
artery-like networks that exert subtle influence and 
connect disparate lands. The greatest of these mag­
ical streams are persistent paths, often known by 
colloquial names or simply as unearthly roads. An 
unearthly road acts like a sort of planar portal that 
stretches from one place to another, be they sites on 
the same world or on different planes of existence. 
Unearthly roads allow creatures to cross great dis-

tances rapidly, moving from an entrance gate to an 
exit gate or visa versa. These paths operate like long 
tunnels, and a creature that travels on an unearthly 
road progresses 2 1  miles of distance in the  time it 
would normally take it to travel  1  mile. While on the 
road, glimpses of the world beyond might be visible 
in blurred or distorted visions of scenery or espe­
cially prominent landmarks. Creatures or specific 
details are not visible beyond an unearthly road. 

Some unearthly roads serve as trade routes or se­
cret connections between distant lands. Others shift 
locations at noteworthy times or in response to ex­
ternal phenomena, like on specific anniversaries or 
in response to the phases of the moon. Some might 
also require a particular item, ritual, or action to 
open their gates. The Unearthly Road Keys table of­
fers suggestions on  how to enter an unearthly road.

NATURAL HAZARDS 

Even without the threats of supernatural environ­
ments, the world is a dangerous place. The follow­
ing natural hazards expand on those presented in 
the Dungeon Masters Guide. 

AVALANCHES 
A typical avalanche (or rockslide) i s  300 feet wide, 
1 50 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the 
path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if 
they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is al­
most impossible. 

When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures 
must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative 
counts  10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until 
it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, 
any creature in its space moves along with it and 
falls prone, and the creature must make a DC 1 5  
Strength saving throw, taking ldlO bludgeoning 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on 
a successful one. 

When an avalanche stops, the snow and other 
debris settle and bury creatures. A creature buried 
in this way is blinded and restrained, and it has total 
cover. The creature gains 1  level of exhaustion for 
every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig it­
self free as an action, breaking the surface and  end­
ing the blinded and restrained conditions on itself 

C H A PT E R  4  I  D U N G E O N   M A S T E R ' S  TOOLS

with a successful DC  15  Strength (Athletics) check. 
A creature that fails this check three times can't at­
tempt to dig itself out again. 

A creature that is not restrained or incapacitated 
can spend  1  minute freeing a buried creature. Once 
free, that creature is no longer blinded or restrained 
by the avalanche. 

FALLING INTO WATER 
A creature that falls into water or another liquid can 
use its reaction to make a DC  15 Strength (Athlet­
ics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface 
head or feet first. On a successful check, any dam­
age resulting from the fall is halved. 

FALLING ONTO A C REATURE 
If a creature falls into the space of a second creature 
and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature 
must succeed on a DC  15  Dexterity saving throw or 
be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage 
resulting from the fall is divided evenly between 
them. The impacted creature is also knocked prone, 
unless it is two or more sizes larger than the fall­
ing creature. 

SPELL EQUIVALENTS OF NATURAL HAZARDS 
Numerous spells emulate the wrath of nature, and 
you can use spell effects to represent a variety of 
natural hazards. The Spells as Natural Hazards ta­
ble presents some common environmental dangers 
and the spells you may use to approximate them.

TASHA  · 

Devious traps and multifaceted mysteries might 
be staples of fantasy adventures, but they're not 
the easiest challenges for a DM to present on the 
fly. This section presents a selection of puzzles de­
signed to invite group participation and challenge 
adventurers of any stripe-from genius scholars to 
martial masters. Each puzzle is flexible enough to 
be included in your campaign as presented or cus­
tomized to fit the needs of a specific adventure. 

WHY  USE  P U Z ZLES? 

Puzzles provide exciting opportunities to use wit to 
overcome obstacles and allow characters to collabo­
rate to make discoveries. You might add a puzzle to 
an adventure for any of the following reasons: 

•  To  encourage a party to discover information 

through teamwork 

•  To provide  an opportunity for characters to use 

their skills in uncommon ways 

•  To make a setting feel more whimsical, mysteri­

ous, or otherworldly 

•  To explain why no one has ever discovered some­

thing hidden close at hand 

•  To reveal a secret no one knows and magic 

can't reveal 

Some puzzles can take considerable time to solve, 
so be mindful of how often you use them in your ad­
ventures. Remember, most puzzles don't need to be 
solved immediately, and they might be all the more 
satisfying if their riddles linger unresolved for multi­
ple sessions. 

PUZ ZLE  ELEMENTS 

Text that a ppears  i n  a  box  l i ke this  is  meant to  be  read 

aloud or paraph rased for the p l ayers when their char­

acters fi rst a rrive i n  a location with a  p uzzle or when 

otherwise noted. 

Additionally, the following sections appear in 
each puzzle: 

Difficulty. Each puzzle is classified as easy, me­

dium, or hard. The harder the puzzle, the more 
likely the players will need hints to solve it. 

Puzzle Features. This section presents an overview 
of the puzzle's features and how they can be inter­
acted with. 

Solution. This section explains how the puzzle 

is solved. 

Hint Checks. This section suggests hints that char­
acters might use their skills to reveal. Provide one 
or more of the hints if the characters get stuck. If 
a character has proficiency in a hint's associated 
skill, give them that hint if they ask you for help. 
Customizing the Puzzle. This section explores how 
to integrate the puzzle into your adventures, alter 
its difficulty, or make other adjustments. 

H INTS 

If players request a hint while attempting to solve 
a puzzle, consult that puzzle's "Hint Checks"  sec­
tion. Each hint is associated with a skill and a DC. 
If a character in the party has proficiency in a skill 
related to a hint, share that hint with them. If the 
same skill is listed multiple times with the same or 
higher DCs, reveal hints with the lowest DCs first 
then hints with higher DCs if the group requests 
additional help. 

If no character has proficiency in any of the listed 

skills, characters can make ability checks using 
the listed skills and DCs. Those who succeed on a 
check learn the associated hint . 

Don't hesitate to reveal hints to the party. Hints 
provide characters with relevant skills the opportu­
nity to  shine, even if they're not usually particularly 
cunning. Additionally, if party members have back­
grounds or campaign experiences that might tie into 
a puzzle, those make great reasons to provide char­
acters with additional hints. 

RUNNING  PUZ ZLES 

Once you've presented a puzzle to a group, feel free 
to add and clarify details as you would  in any other 
type of encounter. Try not to give away details of the 
puzzle's solution in your descriptions, but there's 
nothing wrong with letting a hint slip here or there. 
Don't worry whether it's a player or a character 
who's solving a puzzle. While hint checks provide 
a way for character experience to contribute to a 
puzzle's solution, ultimately the boundaries between 
a player's and a character's ability to solve a puzzle 
isn't as important as the group enjoying the chal­
lenge. However, if a player knows the answer to a 
puzzle in advance, urge them to share only hints 
their character learns. 

After presenting a puzzle, encourage the party 
to solve it together, to pool hints, and to share their 
insights. Work with the group to share any puzzle 
handouts and to take turns talking through their 
thoughts. Ultimately, solving a puzzle will be a vic­
tory for the whole group, not one individual.

C REATU R E  PAI NTINGS 

Difficulty: Easy 

This short puzzle works anywhere  that  makes sense 
for characters to peruse several paintings, such as 
in a museum or manor.  These paintings could even 
appear in a sketchbook found in a dusty old drawer. 
This counting puzzle leads to a name of a creature. 
Fit this into your campaign by making the name 
of the creature the first item on a scavenger hunt or 
the first clue in a larger mystery. 

This gallery is  decorated with seven framed pai ntings 

of creatures. A few chairs and benches have been 

p laced  i n  front of the art for viewing. 

A plaqu e  m o unted on  o n e  of the walls bears the 

fo l lowi n g  dedication: "In ord e r  to gain all knowledge, 

one m ust know where to start. Count on you r  enem ies 

to reve a l  the source of the secret. This room is dedi­

cated to the d efeat of a l l  monsters with in." 

Characters should be free to explore the gallery and 
inspect the paintings and dedication to discover the 
parts of the puzzle. 

PU Z ZLE  FEATURES 

There are seven paintings on the walls. The paint­
ings feature a gruesome werewolf under a full 
moon, a trio of gnolls fighting over a spear, a grin­
ning beholder, two trolls sitting under a tree, five 
kobolds around a bonfire, two gelatinous cubes 
patrolling a dungeon corridor, and three dragons 
in flight. 

SOLUTION 

Each painting features a number of creatures of 
a particular kind, as summarized in the Creature 
Paintings table. Counting into each creature's name 
by the number of creatures in the painting reveals a 
letter. When unscrambled, the  letters  spell out "owl­
bear." Characters are likely to reveal these  letters in 
random order. Arranging them in the correct order 
is part of the puzzle.

SIGNIFICANCE OF "0WLBEAR" 
This puzzle's solution, "owlbear,"  might be the pass­
phrase to bypass a future trap or unlock a magically 
sealed door. It might also be a clue that points to 
a hidden treasure. For example, there might be a 
stuffed owlbear in another room that has treasure 
hidden inside it. 

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has the  option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The charac-
ter deduces that the number of creatures in a 
painting is important and  uses  that number to 
determine which  letter of the creature's name they 
should review. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC  10. When looking at the 
dedication, the words "count on" alert the charac­
ter that they should count the creatures. 

CUSTOMIZING THE  PUZ ZLE 

You can replace the monsters in the artwork with 
distinctive objects, members of obvious professions, 
and anything else that might logically be in a group. 
Then, follow the letter-counting method detailed in 
this puzzle to determine how many subjects should 
feature in each piece of art.

R E C KLE S S  STE P S  

Difficulty: Easy 

This puzzle features a word search on  floor tiles, 
which might present a barrier to exploration in 
myriad scenarios. To  cross safely, characters must 
first uncover what words they're searching for and 
then find them in the tiles. 

You ·enter a cobweb-fil led room  lit by torches on oppo­

site walls.  D ust o n  the floor has collected i n  grooves 

that cover rows of five-foot-squa re tiles. On the oppo­

site wall, a  sol itary a rch leads from the room .  One wall 

bears the fo l l owing i nscri ption: 

Eight appear before your eyes, 

And eight remain in schooled disguise. 

Avoid all magic in this room, 

Lest reckless steps ensure your doom. 

The tiles covering the floor of this room each bear a 
single letter written in the Common alphabet, mak­
ing the room a  giant word search. Traps beneath 
many of the tiles threaten those who move through 
the room heedless of the hidden words. 

PUZ ZLE  FEATURES 

The floor of this 60-foot-by-70-foot room is made 
of 5-foot-square stone tiles laid out in a grid. Each 
tile has a letter chiseled into it, as shown in puzzle 
handout  1  at the end of this chapter. Place a copy of 
the handout for this puzzle on the table, and allow 
players to use miniatures to show how their charac­
ters navigate the room. 

To safely walk across the room, a character must 

step on the correct tiles. Stepping on an incorrect 
tile sets off a trap. 

TRAPS 
Certain tiles (as indicated in this trap's "Solution" 
section) are trapped. A trapped tile is triggered 
when more than 20 pounds of weight are placed 
on it, activating the pressure plate underneath and 
causing jets of poisonous gas to spout from the 
cracks between the tiles. Any creature above the 
trapped floor tile or one of its adjacent tiles must 
make a DC  15 Constitution saving throw, taking  1 1  
(2d 10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 

As an action, a character can disable a trap with 
a successful DC  15 Dexterity check using thieves' 
tools. If a character fails to disable the trap, the tile's 
trap can no longer be disabled. 

Characters can attempt to jump over trapped tiles, 

using the jump rules in the Player's  Handbook. 

SOLUTION 

The only safe tiles for characters to step on are the 
ones with the faded black letters in diagram 4. 1 .  
Red letters spell out either "magic" or one o f  the 
schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, 
enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and 
transmutation. Stepping on one of these tiles trig­
gers a poison trap, as described earlier. 

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has  the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Arcana) DC  10. The character sees 
one instance of a school of magic on the floor. 
Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. The character 
interprets the clue in the wall verse: there are 
eight schools of magic. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. Each character who 
succeeds on this check sees an instance of the 
word "magic" in the floor. 

CUSTOMIZING THE  PUZZLE 

Consider using this puzzle's structure to create any 
number of thematic word searches hiding deadly 
traps. Once you've created a hint suggesting what 
types of words to look for, it's a simple matter to cre­
ate your own grid of hidden words. 

RAISING THE D IFFICULTY 
You can increase this puzzle's difficulty by changing 
the word search's letters to use another alphabet, 
such as those presented in the Player's Handbook. 
Alternatively, you can  create an entirely new code to 
replace the letters, requiring the characters to find a 
cipher to  reveal the tiles' meanings before they can 
undertake the puzzle and cross the room safely. 

You can  also increase the difficulty by introducing 

trap variants, as described below. 

TRAP VARIANTS 
Rather than have the same poison gas trap on every 
trapped tile, each word can have a distinct trap as­
sociated with it, as described below: 

Magic. The trap triggers normally, as described in 

this puzzle's "Traps" section. 

Abjuration. The trap casts dispel magic on each 

creature in the room, using a 9th-level spell slot. 
Conjuration. The trap teleports the creature that 

triggered it back to the entrance of the room. That 
creature must also make a DC  15 Constitution 
saving throw,  taking  1 1  (2d 10) force damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a suc­
cessful one. 

Divination. The creature that triggered the trap 
must succeed on a DC  15 Intelligence saving 
throw or be unable to perceive any of the letters

on the tiles by sight or touch. Any magic that ends 
a curse ends this effect on the character. A player 
whose character is affected by this trap should not 
be allowed to reference the accompanying player 
handout  until the effect on that character ends. 
Enchantment. The trap casts suggestion (save DC 
1 5) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed
save, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tells 
it to move 5 feet in a random direction.  This move­
ment might  cause it to trigger another trap. 

Evocation. Magical fire erupts from the  trapped tile. 

The creature that triggered this trap must suc­
ceed on a DC  1 5  Dexterity saving throw, taking 
1 1  (2d 10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. 

Illusion. A suit of animated armor appears in an 
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature 
that set off this trap. The armor attacks only the 
creature that summoned it and can't leave the 
room. It doesn't set off any of the room's traps and 
disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, it 
lasts for 1  minute. 

Necromancy. Any creature that triggers this trap 
hears a banshee's wail  in its mind. Unless the 
creature is a  construct or undead, it must succeed 
on a DC  13 Constitution saving throw.  On a fail­
ure, the creature drops to 0 hit points. On a suc­
cess, it takes  10 (3d6) psychic damage. 

Transmutation. The trap casts polymorph (save DC 
1 5) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed 
save, the creature turns into a giant frog.

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has  the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Nature) DC 10. The character knows 
that "natural" knowledge about bats, snakes, spi­
ders, and wolves in general won't help here. 
Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character real­
izes that the keys' skull-shaped heads are all the 
same and probably have no bearing on the puz­
zle's solution. 

CUSTOMIZING THE PUZ ZLE 

The focal parts of this puzzle are the locks and keys, 
not the chest. You could easily convert this puzzle 
to feature any types of locks, be they on doors, cells, 
books, or some more esoteric barrier. 

Beyond the form the locks and keys take, you 

might also consider adjusting the creatures depicted 
with each lock to suit your adventures. Just keep 
in mind  that the number of teeth on each key must 
match the number of letters in your substitutions, 
and those substitutions should be things the charac­
ters can identify. 

RAISING THE D IFFICULTY 
Rather than associating each lock with a particular 
image of a creature, consider presenting a riddle 
alongside each lock. The answer to each riddle 
should be the related creature's name, allowing 
characters to match the riddles' answers to the 
proper keys. 

S K E LETON KEYS 

Difficulty: Easy 

This puzzle presents a quick encounter useful for 
providing treasure or information. It features a box 
with four locks.  · 

You come upon a  sinister m etal  box with an  i ro n  lock 

b u i lt  i nto each of its fou r  sides.  Each lock s ports a 

keyhole with a  sculpted  i mage a bove it. Fou r i ron keys 

hang from hooks on a  n earby wa l l ,  a n d  each  key has  a 

d ifferent n u mber of teeth. Above the keys, the fol l ow­

ing verse has been etched i nto the wall: 

The spells on these locks are all the same. 
Though each possesses a unique name. 
Count on your answer to unlock the way, 
But use the wrong key to your dismay. 

All four locks must be opened before the box's con­
tents (whatever they might be) can be accessed. 

PU ZZLE  FEATURES 

Show the players puzzle handout 2 (see the end of 
this chapter) when their characters examine the 
keys. Each key has a different number of teeth: six, 
five, four, and three, respectively. 

Each  lock has a creature molded in  iron above  it: a 
bat, snake, spider, or wolf, respectively. These locks 
can't be picked. If anything other than the correct 
key is placed inside a lock, creatures corresponding 
to the image above the lock (ld4 giant bats,  ld4 
giant poisonous snakes,  ld4 giant wolf spiders,
or  ld4 wolves) are summoned into the room. Each 
summoned creature is hostile and  disappears after 
10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit  points.  These 
beasts can't be charmed or frightened. 

SOLUTION 

Once the characters identify the creature depicted 
above each lock, they should count the letters in 
each creature's name. The number of letters in a 
creature's name  corresponds to  the number of teeth 
on the correct key, as shown in the Skeleton Keys 
Solution table.

ALL THAT  GLITT E R S  

Difficulty: Medium 

This gem-filled room  can  be placed in  any dungeon, 
estate, or building with multiple rooms and might 
serve as both a tr<lp and a place to obtain a reward. 

Dozens of gems lie strewn  u pon the floor. Amid the 

treas u re stands a  m arble statue with  its  hands clasped 

in  front of it.  A  p l acard  at the statue's base reads, 

"Only one treas u re may l eave this room. Cross with 

a nother and  find you r  tomb." 

PUZ ZLE  FEATURES 

The statue, which is impervious to damage, depicts 
Ioun or some other god of knowledge or order. 
Any character who succeeds on a DC  10 Intelli­
gence (Religion) check can identify the figure be­
ing depicted. 

D IAMOND 
Between the palms of the statue's clasped hands is 
a diamond, which can only be found and retrieved 
once the puzzle is solved. Once the characters solve 
the puzzle, the statue's hands open, allowing the 
diamond to be taken. Upon breaching the threshold 
of the room with the diamond, a trapped soul in 
the form of a friendly, thankful spirit is released. 
The spirit leaves to pursue its own goals, and the 
diamond is left behind as a reward. The diamond is 
worth 5,000 gp. 

GEMSTONE S  
A n  inventory of the room reveals the following gem­
stones scattered across the  floor: eighteen pieces of 
jade,  sixteen onyxes, fourteen amethysts, thirteen 
sapphires, twelve rubies, nine pieces of amber, eight 
citrines, five garnets, and one piece of quartz. 

If a creature attempts to leave the room with any 
of these stones, the gem disappears and an angry 
spirit trapped inside it is released. The spirit man­
ifests as a hostile undead creature of your choice, 
such as a ghost, specter, or skeleton. When this 
creature is reduced to 0 hit points, its form dissi­
pates, leaving no trace of itself behind. 

NAMED SPI RITS 
Characters hear each spirit whisper its name before 
it dissipates. The �ames themselves are not import­
ant, other than they must start with the appropriate 
letter of the alphabet. 

The following list provides names for all the im­
prisoned spirits, each name starting with the letter 
associated with the spirit's gemstone prison:

SOLUTION 

An inventory of the room reveals gemstones in 
the amounts shown in the Gem I nventory table. 
The table lists the gems in alphabetical order, but 
you should list them in any other order when de­
scribing them to players so not to accidentally give 
away a hint. 

Each type of gem is associated with a letter of the 
alphabet, and each  gem's letter is revealed by count­
ing into the alphabet by a number of letters equal to 
the number of gems of its type. For example, there 
is one piece of quartz, so "quartz" corresponds to 
the  first  letter of the alphabet (A), while there  are 
fourteen amethysts, so "amethyst" corresponds to 
the fourteenth  letter of the alphabet (N).

Once  the gems are sorted  by type and alphabet­
ized, characters can count into the alphabet by how 
many of each are in the room to reveal the words 
"in her palm." When a character speaks this phrase 
aloud, the statue's folded  hands open, revealing the 
previously hidden diamond. 

HINT CHECKS 

Any character has the option  of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

though, so make sure you present a riddle or other 
signpost to make sure your players notice there's a 
puzzle  at hand. 

LOWERING THE D IFFICULTY 
To  make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can pro­
vide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing a 
hint from a spirit requires a successful DC 1 5  Cha­
risma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Consider 
hints like "A is the fi rst letter in the alphabet" and 
"The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell." 

RELEASING THE SPIRITS 
If the characters don't attempt to remove gems from 
the  room, or if they spend too long deliberating, cre­
ate a new trigger to release the spirits. For example, 
perhaps a spirit is released if a character places a 
gem  near the  statue or if it's held for too long. 

EYE  OF  TH E  B EHOLD E R  

Difficulty: Medium 

This map puzzle is designed to lead a party through 
a dungeon where a roaming beholder doesn't wish 
to be disturbed. A series of clues tie to the word 
"eye," and  the  characters must determine how to get 
through the area safely. 

A d isorienti n g  wave  sweeps over you .  S u d d e n ly, 

you r  s u rrou n d i ngs are u nfa m i l i a r  a n d  s h ro ud ed

Out of the gloom a ppears  a  hooded gob l i n  carryi n g  

a  lantern. 

Intelligence (Arcana) DC  1 5. The character can 

" H ello, friends!" the gob l i n  says. "I can  help you 

determine that there are spirits i mprisoned in the 
gemstones scattered on the floor. 

Intelligence (Religion) DC  10.  The  character 

knows that the statue represents a god of knowl­
edge and order, and the character has a strong 
feeling that the order of the gems in the room is 
important. 

Wisdom (Insight) DC 10. The character senses that 

the number of each type of gem isn't arbitrary. 

CUSTOMIZING THE  PU ZZLE 

This puzzle explores how to use groups of objects 
to disguise a message. So long as your groups can 
be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being 
arranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you must 
do is adjust the number of items to correspond to 
a particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively, 
perhaps another organizing principle orders your 
groups. For example, tombstones that feature vary­
ing numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates, 
while stacks of books might be ordered by shared 
page-counts.  These  details can be easy to miss, 

through these parts-if you  can figure out my  riddles. 

You don't want to make a wrong turn i n  here, as there 

a re  eyes  everywhere. Solve the ridd les a n d  fo l low my 

d i rections to the letter." 

The goblin is friendly, and its offer is genuine. ft's 
name is Igor (pronounced eye-gar), which it reveals 
only if asked. The characters find themselves in 
a maze that emits magical darkness that can't be 
dispelled. No vision can penetrate this darkness, 
and only the goblin's lantern can illumi nate it . Igor's 
lantern  emits light in a 5-foot radius, but only so 
long as the gobl in  holds it. The  lantern  goes dark if 
any other creature takes custody of it. 

PU ZZLE  FEATURES 

The magical maze the characters find themselves in 
is comprised of an endless series of identical cham­
bers. Each chamber has four passages, one at each 
cardinal direction. The gobJin guide poses riddles 
that can lead the party along the path that ultimately 

C H A PT E R  4  I  D U N G E O N   M A S T E R ' S  TOOLS 

Once the goblin has the characters' attention, it 
provides the first riddle, then waits for the party to 
venture down  a passage of its choice. The  goblin 
stops at each intersection and either provides the 
next riddle (if the party chose the correct path) or 
avoids the monster the group encounters (if the 
party chose the incorrect path), leading the charac­
ters back to the last correct chamber along the path 
after any battle. 

The goblin's riddles (and their answers) are 

as follows: 

•  What beast has the sharpest eye? (Eagle) 
•  Threads get pulled through the eye of 

what? (Needle) 

•  What is the eye to the soul? (Window) 
•  Whose eye matters to a witch's brew? (Newt) 
•  This eye curses you with misfortune. (Evil) 
•  This eye brings a temporary calm. (Storm) 
•  Roll a one on a six-sided die. Roll another and get 
the same. Take both together, and what's their 
name? (Snake eyes) 

SOLUTION 

The answer to each riddle begins with a letter in­
dicating the direction of the path the characters 
should follow next. The path provided by the riddles' 
answers takes the following route: east, north, west, 
north, east, south, south. This path leads the charac­
ters through some chambers more than once, which 
is a necessary part of the magic that will allow them 
to escape. 

H INT CHE CKS 

Any character has the  option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Charisma (Persuasion) DC 15. The goblin provides 
a hint in the form of a synonym of the riddle's an­
swer (for example, "lizard" for "newt"). 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 10. After a few rid­
dles are answered correctly, a character notices 
that all the answers relate to eyes. 

Wisdom (Insight) DC  15. After one or more correct 

answers are given, the character realizes that 
each answer corresponds to a cardinal direction. 

CUSTOMIZING  THE  PU ZZLE 

.The characters can easily persuade the goblin to 
join their party. What other secrets does the goblin 
know? Does he have an agenda for helping the char­
acters find their freedom? And why has he lingered 
in the maze if he knows the way out? There might 
be more to this guide than meets the eye. 

exits  the maze. Each  time  the  party moves through 
the correct passage and enters a new room, the gob­
lin provides them with a new riddle that hints which 
direction to travel in next. If they make an error, 
the characters encounter a monster of your choice 
and then must backtrack from their last correct 
turn. After three wrong turns, the party encounters 
the beholder. 

HALLWAYS 
The halls of this maze are 60 feet long and  10 feet 
wide. If the characters move away from the guide 
during combat or for any other reason, the goblin 
encourages them to follow him back to the last cor­
rect turn. 

THE GOBLIN'S RIDDLES 
Upon meeting the characters (and to discourage 
them from attacking), the goblin  makes it clear 
there is no way out of the maze without his help. 
Characters can determine that the goblin is sincere 
in wanting to help with a successful DC  10 Wisdom 
(Insight) check.

Solving this puzzle causes a secret compartment in 
the altar to open, revealing treasure hidden within. 
The compartment can't be opened in any other way. 

P U Z Z LE  FEATURES 

Nine dwarf skulls rest near a grid of 1-foot-square 
tiles, as shown in puzzle handout 3 (see the end of 
this chapter). Columns and rows in the grid are la­
beled with the markings I,  II, or III. 

SOLUTION 

The numbers labeling each  row and column denote 
how many skulls belong within. Characters must 
place the skulls so that the correct number of skulls 
appear both in the rows and columns, while still 
covering four of the stars. This puzzle has multiple 
possible solutions, with one shown in diagram 4.2. 

, / 

H INT CHECKS 

Dwarf characters have advantage on ability checks 
to gain hints in this room. Any character has the op­
tion of making these ability checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The verse indi­
cates to the character that four of the skulls need 
to rest on tiles engraved with stars. 

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The I,  II,  and III mark­
ings around the  edge of the grid likely denote 
how many skulls must be placed in those rows 
and columns. 

CUSTOMIZING THE  P U Z Z LE 

If one of the characters is a dwarf, this might be 
the perfect time to bring in a familial storyline. Are 
these the skulls of their long-lost clan? Does one of 
the skulls belong to a relative that they have been 
seeking? And what do they think the puzzle is im­
plying with only four of the nine skulls receiving 
"celestial beds"?

Difficulty: Medium 

Three numerical dials seal a box, door, or other 
locked object. Figuring out the correct combination 
is the goal of this puzzle, as there are no visible 
locks to pick. 

PUZ ZLE  FEATURES 

The numbers the dials are originally set to don't 
matter. If the players ask, choose any three digits 
you please. 

A corked wooden tube contains two clues: a map 

of an island and a set of directions. 

MAP 
Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 4 (see the 
end of this chapter). This map depicts an unfamiliar 
island with various landmarks but no key. 

DIRECTIONS 
The directions are written on a single sheet of 
parch ment and  recount the route a group  took in 
their search for treasure: 

Day 1. O u r  search for the  lost treasure  began  at the 

northwest i nlet,  W i n d staff Cove. After u n load i n g  o u r  

n ecessities, w e  traveled east t o  Lon e  P i n e ,  t h e n  south­

west past North ridge to the Palms Oasis. As eve n i n g  

a pproached , we contin ue d  southeast t o  A n c h o r  Point, 

then camped i n  the G reat  Du nes. 

Day 2.  In the morni ng, we arose at the D unes a n d  

headed t o  Dea d m a n 's Cave. After fi n d i n g  it em pty, o u r  

party conti n ue d  t o  the Golden Ziggu rat.  H ead i ng d u e  

east, w e  made c a m p  at the Swi r l i ng Sands. 

D a y  3 .  After a  stra n ge  n ight's sleep, we awoke o n  

t h e  third  d ay back at Anchor Point with  no memo ry 

or trace of trave l i n g  there. The Swi r l i n g  Sands m u st 

h ave taken  us  i n  the n ight! We skirted the Swi rling 

Sands to reach the Red Tower b ut still cou l dn't fi n d  

t h e  treasu re. Thinking that w e  m ay have overlooked 

someth ing in the cave, we headed  back. From there, 

we h ea d ed  to the southern coast to see if the treasu re 

was  at  Kraken Point. F i n d i n g  noth i n g, we returned to 

Anchor Point. What awaited  us there was u n l i ke any 

treas u re we'd i m agined. 

SOLUTION 

Characters who follow the directions and  trace their 
paths on the map reveal three numbers: 3, 4, and 8 
(see diagram 4.3). Turning the dials to these nu m­
bers in  the  same  order opens  the locked object.

D I A G R A M  4.3:  ILLU S I V E   I S L A N D   P UU L E   S O L U T I O N  

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence {Investigation) DC 10. The word 

"trace" from  the  Day 3 entry strikes the character 
as important, suggesting that the map is meant to 
be drawn on. 

Wisdom {Insight) DC  15. The map doesn't have 

labels, which means the names of the landmarks 
aren't significant. What's important are thei r posi­
tions relative to one another. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC  10. The fact that the ex­
pedition lasted three days is significant, as there 
are three dials. 

Wisdom (Survival) DC  15. The character knows 
the  directions don't represent an  efficient way to 
search  an  area and  deduces the  directions must 
be presenting some sort of message. 

CUSTOMIZING  THE  PUZ ZLE 

Consider creating your own map and series of direc­
tions to customize this puzzle. By crafting di rections 
that suit locations in your campaign's' setting, you 
can create a puzzle that's integrated  into you r adven­
ture's plot, using a map the characters might already 
possess. Your version of the puzzle can add as many 
digits and directions as you see fit, or it might reveal 
letters, symbols, or short words, depending on the 
complexity of your design. 

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY 
You  can increase this puzzle's chal lenge by dividing 
the map into pieces that need to be separately dis­
covered, or the characters might need to  learn the 
directions from someone who personally explored 
the island. As long as the order of locations doesn't 
change,  the code remains correct. 

MATERIAL C OM P O N E NT S  

Difficulty: Medium 

This puzzle might appear in  a wizard's workshop, 
study, or spellbook. The solution  leads to a pass­
word that reveals new or rare spells (such as those 
in chapter 3). Alternatively, the password can be 
used for any other function that fits with your story. 

You fi n d  a n  old piece of paper beari n g  a  l ist of spells 

a n d  com ponents.  Random letters are also scratched 

q uickly on the paper between the two l ists. A  message 

at the top of the page says, " read u ntouched to gai n  

new spells." 

Give the players a copy of puzzle handout 5 (see the 
end of this chapter). 

PU ZZLE  FEATURES 

The wizard's study is filled with spell components, 
books, potions, and various odds and ends. While 
the various supplies might help characters solve 

0 1 1\ G R l\ M  4 . 4 :   M l\T E R l l\ L  C O M P O N E N T S  P U 1.1. L E   S O L U T I O N

the puzzle, the only item the characters need is the 
parchment. If the puzzle is giving them grief, they 
can take the parchment with them and fi nd others 
who can help them solve it. 

BOOKCASES 
All around the wizard's study are shelves and cases 
filled with books, scrolls, and other supplies. A char­
acter who makes a successful DC  12  Intelligence 
(Arcana) check notices a spell component with no 
gp value from the list (such as a chip of mica or a bit 
of bat fur). 

LISTS 
The parchment has a list of spells and a list of 
material components. However, the components to 
the right don't match  with  the adjacent spells to the 
left. The parchment itself doesn't have any magical 
qualities, but the word it reveals potentially does. 
Wizards and other spellcasters can identify the 
correct spell components for any spell they know, 
but they must succeed on the I ntelligence (Arcana) 
checks noted in the "Hint Checks" section below to 
recall the correct material components for any less 
familiar spells. 

SOLUTION 

Drawing a line from a spell to its material com­
ponent crosses out letters that fall between the 
columns, as shown  in diagram 4.4.  Once  all  spells 
are connected to components, the untouched letters 
spell out "presto," which, when said aloud with the 
paper in hand, causes one or more spell scrolls 
(or some other treasure of your choice) to magi­
cally appear. 

C H A PT E R  4  I  D U N G E O N   M A S T E R ' S  TOOLS

1 8 1  

H INT  CHECKS 

Any character has  the  option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Arcana) DC  10. The character recalls 
up to three of the material components for spells 
on the list they don't currently know. 

Wisdom (Insight) DC  1 5. The character suspects 
that the jumbled letters in the middle-or some 
number of them-probably spell out a command 
word, pass-phrase, or important clue. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC 10. The character notices 
that straight lines drawn between spells and mate­
rial components cross through some of the letters 
in the center. 

CUSTOMI Z ING THE  PU ZZLE 

While spells and components make easy to associ­
ate lists, you might also consider creating your own 
version of this puzzle using paired sets of monsters 
and creature  types, planes of existence and their 
native inhabitants, famous figures in a setting and 
their homelands, and so forth. 

LOWERING THE D IFFICULTY 
If your party doesn't include characters with con­
siderable magical expertise, consider adding art to 
the room's walls or on decorative book covers that 
reveal connections between the listed spells and 
components. These images might give away a few 
connections between the lists or lower the DCs of 
the puzzle's hint checks. 

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY 
Rather than using common spells the characters 
might be familiar with, a more challenging version 
of this puzzle might feature lost spells or other lore 
the party has no way of knowing.  Only by consulting 
experts, undertaking research, or further adventur­
ing might the party reveal the connections between 
the two lists. 

M E M B E RS  O N LY 

Difficulty: Medium 

A secret club, cultist meeting, or thieves' guild re­
quires a password to enter. In this  puzzle, those 
who guard a certain door are so secretive that they 
change the password constantly, fearing someone 
might have infiltrated their members' ranks. 

You watch a figure a p p roach an  oak door with  a  slide 

window. The figure  knocks, and a guard  opens the 

wi ndow and says, " S ix." The figure  replies, "Three." 

The guard then opens the door, a l lowi ng the fi g u re 

to enter. 

This building seems to have only one entrance: the 
oak door with a small slide window. A guard opens 
the window and speaks a seemingly random num­
ber to anyone who knocks on the door. 

PU ZZLE  FEATURES 

Even after observing the building from all angles, 
characters only see members entering through the 
one door after speaking to the guard. 

DOOR 
The door is made o f  oak reinforced with 3-ioch-wide 
iron bars. Three deadbolts secure the door, which 
is also barred from the inside, so there are no locks 
that can be picked from the outside. 

GUARD 
A guard stands on the other side of the door around 
the clock, and the only way to speak with the guard 
is through the door's slide window. The guard can 
be any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin,
a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous options 
include a bugbear, wereboar, or nycaloth.

If a character knocks on the door, the guard slides 
open the window and gruffly gives a number, expect­
ing the proper response. The guard gives a different 
number each time someone knocks. Any proper 
response grants a single character entry, and the 
guard only allows one member to enter at a time. 
Characters who provide incorrect answers and 
attempt to enter again must disguise themselves 
in some way or be refused entry. The guard only 
willingly opens the door for someone who speaks 
the correct password. The guard raises the alarm if 
unauthorized people try to open or bypass the door, 
calling six more guards to help defend the entrance. 

MEMBERS 
If the characters continue watching the door, they 
see up to four more visitors approach it. To eaves­
drop on each exchange, the characters must suc­
ceed on a DC 1 2  group Dexterity (Stealth) check to 
remain hidden; if the group check fails,  the visitor 
notices they're being observed and speaks quietly 
enough that their answer can't be overheard.

SOLUTION 

Each member that approaches the door is given 
a number by the guard. There is no mathematical 
equation here; the only valid response to a number 
given by the guan;:I is the number of letters in the 
guard's number. 

For example, one member was given the number 

"six." There are three letters in the word "six," so 
the password for that member is "three." More po­
tential answers are provided in the Potential Pass­
words table.

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character 
deduces there is no mathematical equation that 
connects the numbers exchanged between the 
guard and visitors. 

Wisdom (Insight) DC 15. The character suspects 
that the answer has to do with the word, not 
the number. 

CUSTOMIZING THE  PUZZLE 

Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that it 
misleads players into thinking they're overhearing 
a mathematical equation. To  figure out the solution, 
they have to first overcome their own assumptions. 
An easier version of this puzzle might involve 
counting the letters in any type of word the guard 
provides and responding with that number. Alter­
natively, the response to the guard's number might 
be any word with the same number of letters as that 
number-for example, "five" has four letters, making 
"duck" or "smog" suitable responses. The more your 
puzzle plays with numbers as words rather than dig­
its, the more challenging it's likely to be. 

E XACT  C H A NGE 

Difficulty: Hard 

This puzzle provides an  elaborate, coin-based lock 
to any sort of door, vault, or other barrier. 

The door here  is  locked a n d  has no  handle.  I nstead, 

there is a  slot i n  the door with an engraving a bove 

it that reads, " I nsert exact change here." N earby, a 

wooden bowl of coin s  rests atop a wooden table. 

The tabletop is engraved with  nine squares i n  a 

th ree-by-three grid. N a i l ed  to the table's leg is  a  piece 

of parch ment with the fol lowi ng in structions: 

Fifteen per column, fifteen per row; 
Diagonally,  the same is so. 
A plea of warning to carefully count; 
No two places may hold the same amount. 
What coins in the center be fed through the door; 
Exact change for passage or trouble galore. 

PUZ ZLE  FEATURES 

The bowl on the table contains forty-five gold coins. 
The puzzle requires that an exact number of coins 
be fed into the slot into the door. If the wrong 
amount is deposited, it triggers either an alarm or a 
trap of your choice. 

SOLUTION 

Diagram 4.5 shows how to divide the forty-five coins 
so that every square has a different amount and 
each row and column adds up to fifteen.

H I NT  CHECKS 

Any character has  the  option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC  15. The character 
realizes that if diagonal corners add up to ten, it 
makes filling out the rest of the grid much easier.

FOU R  E L E M E NTS 

Difficulty:  Hard 

This puzzle might !'lppear anywhere elementals of 
earth, air, fire, and water serve as guardians. If the 
puzzle isn't solved correctly, one or more of these 
guardian elementals magically transform from stat­
ues and attack the characters. 

The door slams  beh i n d  you as you enter this hexag­

onal  room .  Four of the wal ls are covered  i n  mosaics, 

each d epicting the destructive force of one of the four 

e le me nts. Four n i ne-foot-tal l ,  ston e  statues of ele­

mentals  line the far wal l  across from  the closed door. 

Above the statues is a row of square ti les with tria ngu­

lar symbols pai nted on them. Four of these tiles have 

fal le n  off and  lie strewn upon the floor, which  bears 

the fo l lowing i n scri ption :  

Four elementals trapped i n  stone, 
Their elements ordered to lock their home. 
Even patterns against all odd, 
A tile misplaced awakens its god. 
In proper order safely seal these four, 
Or best one of each to open  the door. 

Once  the characters enter this room, the door be­
hind  them slams shut.  It can be  opened  only by com­
pleting this puzzle, and there are no other exits.

PUZ ZLE  FEATURES 

SOLUTION 

The mosaics, statues, and tiles are described below 
in greater detail. 

MOSAIC S 
The four wall  mosaics depict  the following: 

•  A water elemental crashes through a city wall in a 
huge wave.  In  the  center of the  image is a triangle 
pointing downward. 

•  An earth  elemental looms over a group of war­

riors. A triangle pointing downward with a hori­
zontal line through it is carved into its chest. 
•  A fire elemental burns through a forest town. 
In the center of the flames is a triangle point­
ing upward. 

•  An air elemental gusts through a stormy sky. 

Within the  clouds is a triangle pointing upward 
with a line running horizontally through it. 

STATUES 
The statues are actual elementals magically bound 
in stone. The magic that turned these elementals 
into statues is slowly coming undone, as the tile pat­
tern that binds them has fallen apart. 

TILES 
If the characters don't replace the four fallen tiles in 
their proper sequence, all four statues revert to their 
true forms at the same time and attack the charac­
ters. The exact timing of this event is left to you, but 
the characters should be given enough time to take 
a crack at solving the puzzle. The characters can 
also release the elementals individually by putting 
titles in the wrong order or orientation. 

Puzzle handout 6 (see the end of this chapter) 
illustrates the row of tiles set into the wall above 
the statues. Without a check, the characters real­
ize that four of the tiles fell down when the door 
slammed shut behind them. With a successful DC 
15  Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character can de­
termine that these tiles are what keeps the elemen­
tals bound. 

If a tile  is placed  in the wrong place  in the row, 

the corresponding elemental is freed from its 
stone prison and attacks.  Only  one of each elemen­
tal appears: 

• 

• 

• 

If the improperly placed tile has an open triangle 
pointing downward, the water elemental is freed. 
1f the improperly placed  tile  has an open triangle 
pointing upward, the fire elemental is freed. 
If the improperly placed tile has a triangle point­
ing upward with a horizontal line running through 
it, the air elemental is freed. 

•  If the improperly  placed tile has a triangle point­
ing downward with a horizontal line running 
through it, the earth elemental is freed.

The odd-numbered tiles form a recurring pat­

tern of open  triangles that alternate between 
pointing up and down. Tiles  1 ,  5, 9, and  1 3  are 
upward-pointing triangles, while tiles 3, 7, and  1 1  
are downward-pointing triangles. 

The even-numbered tiles display a different pat­
tern. Tiles 2 and 4 point downward, but the first of 
them has a line through the triangle. Tiles 6 and 8 
follow the  same pattern, but the triangles point up. 
The pattern then repeats, with tiles  10  and  1 2  being 
the same as tiles 2 and 4 and tile  14 being the same 
as tile 6. 

Solving the puzzle or defeating all four elementals 

causes the door to the room to swing open. 

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has  the  option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC  15. The character 
notes the words "even" and "odd" in the verse on 
the room's floor and believes they have some sig­
nificance to the missing tiles. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC  10. The character 
can deduce which tiles correspond to which 
elementals. 

CUSTOMIZ ING  THE  PU ZZLE 

Interweaving multiple patterns makes it easy to 
disguise them. With  this in mind, you might use  any 
group of symbols to create as elaborate a series of 
patterns as you please, then  challenge players to 
fill  in a missing segment. While the symbols in  this 
puzzle refer to the four elements, you might use holy 
symbols, colors, dolls on a shelf, or any other repeat­
ing design to convey your puzzle. 

When an elemental is defeated, it might leave be­
hind a valuable gemstone , a map fragment, a clue to 
some other puzzle, or something similar. 

RAISING THE DIFFICULTY 
To  increase the difficulty of this puzzle, enforce a 
time factor:  perhaps one elemental breaks free at 
the end of every five minutes of real time that pass 
until the puzzle is solved. 

You can also raise the difficulty by having statues 

depict genies instead of elementals. In this case, 
replace the four elementals with a dao, a djinni, an 
efreeti, and a marid. These genies are compelled to 
attack the characters and can't be reasoned with.

with the alcoves in the hall (see "Alcoves" later 
in this section). While Dolora can't answer vague 
questions about the candles' clues (such as "Who 
is this talking about?"), she can provide the names 
of specific people when prompted. For example, if 
a character asks directly,  "What was your mother's 
name?" Dolora provides the correct response. She 
also spells out the name, which is a clue that the 
spelling is important. 

PUZZLE  FEATURES 

Dolora can't leave the hall and avoids the alcoves. 

ALCOVES 
The hall i s  lined with six alcoves, each one with a 
unique numeral between  1  and 6 carved above it. A 
verse scratched into the back wall of each alcove is 
made visible by the candlelight. Each verse is pre­
sented below, accompanied by a parenthetical expla­
nation that shouldn't be shared with the players or 
their characters: 

Verse  1. "Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved and 

hated at the same time." (This refers to Dolora's 
brother, whose name was Sam.) 

Verse 2.  "My first vision: her hazel eyes. My first 
sound: her lullabies." (This refers to Dolora's 
mother, whose name was Delia.) 

Verse 3. "Her lives she lost, all three by three, and 

through the dark this hunter sees." (This refers to 
Dolora's cat, whose name was Fifi.) 

Verse 4. "Lines in his face of life lived long; stories 
were his paternal song." (This refers to Dolora's 
grandfather, whose name was Tobias.) 

Verse 5. "Mentor and guide, her lessons learned. 

Knowledge measured by letters I earned." 
(This refers to Dolora's teacher, whose name 
was Johana.) 

Verse 6. "Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did; 

Jived in one room with a shoat and a kid." (This re­
fers to Dolora's horse, whose name was Alexia.) 

Each verse describes someone who was close to 
Dolora. Once the characters determine who a verse 
is talking about, they may ask Dolora to provide 
the correct name. For example,  "What is your cat's 
name?" is a valid question for verse 3. The spirit 
then answers, "Fifi," and she spells it aloud. 

CANDLES 
Each candle is a simple, 6-inch-tall wax taper. While 
in this hall, the candles never melt down and can't 
be extinguished. 

RAG D OLL 
If the characters examine the rag doll or ask Dolora 
about it, she imparts the following information: 

H AU N T E D   HALLWAY 

Difficulty: Hard 

Many unquiet spirits linger in the world because 
they can't bare to leave something behind. In this 
puzzle, finding the solution also means helping a 
lost soul  find peace. 

Six alcoves l i ne  this  h a l l ,  each  one n u m bered fro m  one 

to six. O n  the floor of each alcove, a  lit candle gen-

tly fl ickers. 

From the h a l l 's far end d rifts a  low m oa n .  There, 

barely visible, sobs the apparition of a  small girl hov­

ering over a d iscarded rag d o l l .  " N ames, names," 

she cries.  "I can remember them a l l  except the 

one I  need." 

The spirit, Dolora, is a harmless apparition who 
won't engage the party in combat. If threatened, she 
vanishes and reappears at the opposite end of the 
hall, sobbing anew. 

If approached with compassion, Dolora bemoans 

the fact that she can't pick up her doll until she 
speaks its name, which she has forgotten. She re­
fuses to leave this place without the doll. 

Dolora, who only recalls fragmented memories 

of her life, can't answer many questions.  This is 
particularly true about the messages associated

SOLUTION 

Once  the characters learn all six names, they must 
extrai::t one letter from each name, as noted in the 
Remembered Names table. An alcove's number 
determines which letter to extract; for example, 
"Alexia" is the name connected to the verse in al­
cove 6, and the sixth Jetter in that name is A.

The  doll's name is Sefina. Once  Dolora is told this, 

she picks up the doll, speaks its name, and disap­
pears with it, her spirit having been laid to rest. If 
there's some piece of information you wish to have 
the spirit reveal to the party, such as the location of 
a nearby treasure or the secret of a more dangerous 
spirit, Dolora whispers this as she fades away. 

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Charisma (Persuasion) DC  10. Dolora thinks of 
the character as her friend. When this character 
figures out the answer to a riddle, Dolora calls out 
the name of the person it's about unprompted (for 
example, as soon as the character says "mother" 
aloud, Dolora calls out "Delia"). 

Charisma (Intimidation) DC  15. The character 

frightens Dolora into divulging information. She 
tells the character that she remembers the names 
of people she knew. Dolora also reveals that it's 
important that their names be spelled correctly, 
though she doesn't say why. 

Intelligence (Investigation) DC 15. The character 
interprets Dolora's cryptic clue about the doll as 
follows: "all six" refers to the six letters of the 
doll's name, which can be determined by gather­
ing information from the verses in the six alcoves. 

The characters discover that a popular local tavern 
is a front for a secret organization that they seek 
to join or infiltrate. The name of the tavern can be 
whatever you want it to be. One suggestion is the 
Cloak & Dagger. 

To get their foot in  the proverbial door, the char­

acters must speak the correct password to the 
tavern-keeper, Holda Heidrun. They can discover 
this password by solving a puzzle hidden in the 
tavern's menu. 

The tavern  is crowded with h a p py people e njoyi n g  

their food  a n d  drin ks. B e h i n d  the bar, a  stocky wom a n  

is wiping d o w n  the wooden bar top. She looks u p  a s  

y o u  e n t e r  a n d  n ods toward a n  e m pty t a b l e  before her 

attention is d rawn e lsewhere. You  see a copy of the 

taver n 's  m e n u  on the table. 

Customize the tavern and flesh out its occupants as 
you see fit. 

In addition to being the tavern-keeper, Holda 
Heidrun is the keeper of many secrets. If the char­
acters prod her for information, she asks for the 
password, and if the characters don't know it, she 
divulges nothing of consequence. "If you're worth 
your weight in copper," she says, "you'd speak the 
password to earn my trust." 

PUZZLE  FEATU RES 

A sign at the bar declares that a meal costs 1  sp, a 
mug of ale  costs 4 cp, a  glass of fine wine  costs  1 
sp,  and a bottle of fine wine  costs  3 sp. The menu 
on the table contains a list of specialties the tavern 
serves, and how much each item costs. Only the 
menu is needed to solve the puzzle. 

MENU 
Characters who peruse the menu see the items 
listed in the Menu Items table, in the order given.

SOLUTION 

Arrange the menu items in alphabetical order, then 
count into each item by the number of letters indi­
cated in its price, as shown in the What's On the 
Menu Solution table. Stringing the seven letters 
together forms the password: chimera.

E  (6th letter) 

Rabbit stew  (1  cp) 

R  ( 1 st letter) 

Seared  boar  and  potatoes  (3 cp) 

A  (3rd  letter) 

The characters can figure out the password with­

out putting the menu items in alphabetical order. 
Once  they get all seven letters, they must solve the 
anagram to get the password. 

Speaking the correct password to Holda grants 
access to whatever secrets she's keeping-fuel for 
the characters' next adventure. 

1 8 8  

C H A P T E R  4  I  D U N GEON  M A ST E R ' S  TOOLS 

H INT CHECKS 

Any character has the option of making these ability 
checks to receive a hint: 

Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) DC  15. 
The character convinces Holda to whisper the 
following hint: "Count your lucky coppers that we 
have seven choices on the menu for you." 

Dexterity (Stealth) DC  15. The character blends 

in with the crowd to eavesdrop on another table, 
overhearing the patrons discussing how they must 
have gotten a misprinted menu because the prices 
don't seem right, or bemoaning the fact that the 
menu doesn't list items in alphabetical order. 

Intelligence (History) DC  15. The character recalls 
stories of how secret messages used to be sent 
through taverns using common items anyone 
could access, such as menus. 

Wisdom (Perception) DC  15. The character notices 
the prices on the menu don't make much sense. 
For example, why is rabbit stew so much cheaper 
than corn and lentil stew? 

CUSTOMIZ ING  THE  PUZZLE 

����

"Chimera" might not be the password but rather 
a reference to something or someone else in the 
tavern. Characters who solve the puzzle and suc­
ceed on a DC  15 Wisdom (Perception) check might 
notice another patron wearing a cloak pin shaped 
like a chimera, or spot a shield emblazoned with a 
chimera hanging on a wall that conceals a secret 
door. Only after speaking to the patron or seeing 
what's on the other side of the secret door do the 
characters obtain the actual password, which can 
be anything you want. 

You  can easily change "chimera" to something 

else by  swapping out menu items, choosing different 
letters within the replacement items, and adjusting 
the prices accordingly. 

LOWERING THE D IFFICULTY 
Other tavern patrons can provide additional hints 
by talking among themselves in places where the 
characters can overhear them. A patron might say 
something like,  "This inn keeps getting more expen­
sive. With these fancy new meals, I 'm surprised they 
aren't charging a copper per letter!" 

A too-helpful barmaid might take pity on the strug­
gling characters and walk them through the various 
menu items in the order that would allow  them to 
skip the anagram (ale and cheese pastry, brandied 
ham and carrots, corn and lentil soup, dragonfire 
mead, grilled fish and carrots, rabbit stew, and 
seared boar and potatoes). She might even recom­
mend that  the characters "start with the ale  and 
cheese pastry,  and continue on from there."
