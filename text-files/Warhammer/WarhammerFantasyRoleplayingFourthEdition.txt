‘so, what are you here for? Adventure? 
           maybe. Gold? probably. Justice? 

Ha, that’s a flexible term! What’s that I see in your eye, that pious gleam? Oh, you want 
to do the right thing. So long as it’s well enough paid, entertaining, and fits with your 
political views. eh, close enough, you’ll do, come inside and I’ll tell you about the job.’

Welcome to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Marvellous things 
await you. One of your group will control an entire world, while 
the  rest  of  you  will  live  in  and  explore  it,  uncovering  glittering 
wonders, vile darkness, and everything in between. 

Prepare yourself for the struggle of the gutter, to fight for your 
survival, and to face corruption on all sides. Prepare yourself for 
danger, as it is everywhere, and you can’t face it alone. And, most 
of  all,  prepare  yourself  for  the  grim  and  perilous  adventure  of 
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay!

You’ll  meet  glorious  heroes  who  grimace  disdainfully  as  they 
step over the suffering poor, and corrupt villains who set down 
the wrong path in the service of a more laudable cause.  Feared 
but respected wizards master their arts in the high towers of the 
Colleges of Magic, while outside those safe halls magic users are 
feared and reviled — and often with good cause, as many dark 
sorcerers would gladly sell their souls for power. Virtuous priests 
strive endlessly to improve the lives of the downtrodden, whilst 
agents  of  Chaos  Gods  work  to  undermine  this  good  work  and 
bring ruination.

Roleplaying games
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) is a tabletop roleplaying 
game  (RPG).  You  might  be  more  familiar  with  computer 
or  console  RPGs,  in  which  case  you’ll  be  right  at  home.  One 
of your group will take the role of Gamemaster (GM) — who 
describes the world and what is happening — and everyone else 
will  be  a  Player  —  one  of  the  game’s  protagonists,  interacting 
with the world the GM presents. Players tell the GM what their 

throWInG Bones

Games of WFRP use ten-sided dice whenever a random result is 
required. ten-sided dice are typically marked from 0–9, where a 
roll of 0 counts as a result of 10. these dice are called d10s in 
the rules, and the number you need to roll will always be marked 
as follows: 1d10 for 1 die, 2d10 for two dice, 3d10 for three dice, 
and so on. 

If you are requested to roll multiple dice like this, the results are 
always added together. so, if the rules ask you to roll 2d10, you roll 
two ten-sided dice and add the result of each together; for example: 
a roll of 0 and 3 would be a result of 13 (10+3=13).

Sometimes, a die roll will be modified by adding or subtracting a 
number. so, a roll of 1d10+4 means roll one ten-sided die and add 
four to the result, and a roll of 2d10−3 indicates you should roll 2 
ten-sided dice and subtract 3 from the totalled result.

the rules also use a roll of two ten-sided dice to score a number 
from 1 to 100 (marked as 1d100). to do this, one ten-sided die is 
designated as a ‘tens’ die, and the other as the ‘units’ die. now roll 
the two dice, and read the result as a two-digit number. so a roll of 
1 on the tens die and 4 on the units die provides a result of 14, or a 
roll of 4 and 2 results with 42. If both dice roll 0, the result is 100.

Characters  are  doing,  and  the  GM  interprets  the  outcomes  of 
those actions, using the game’s rules where necessary. The game 
proceeds in that fashion, with the Players pursuing the plot the 
GM  has  prepared  for  the  game,  or  perhaps  going  off  at  wild 
tangents as the poor GM improvises like crazy. It’s all good.

This book is the rulebook and includes all the information and 
options for running your games of WFRP. If you’ve never played 
an  RPG  before,  we’d  recommend  you  try  the  Warhammer 
Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set — which is designed to teach you 
how to play — or take a look at the ‘What is an RPG?’ section of 
our website: www.cubicle7.co.uk.

Using This Book
Roughly  speaking,  the  Player-focused  parts  of  this  book  are  to 
the front. New players should start by browsing the double-page 
spreads and letter that introduce the Empire as this is where the 
initial adventures that Cubicle 7 publishes will be set. 

Players should then use the next few chapters to learn about their 
Characters  and  abilities.  Chapter  5,  the  Rules,  are  for  everyone. 
Players whose characters have a religious or magical background 
will  want  to  be  familiar  with  the  respective  sections  later  in  the 
book. The GM can communicate to the Players as much or as little 
of the Reikland and Bestiary chapters as they should appropriately 
know, but remember not to give away too many spoilers.

individual spells a wizard can cast. Each individual item will be 
italicised. Example: a Banking Endeavour; a Bleeding Condition; 
the Curse Spell.

Tests: When you are asked to make a Test (see page 149), it will 
be bolded so you can find it easily during play. Example: make an 
Average (+20) Perception Test.

Acronyms: The rulebook avoids them as much as possible, but 
it’s  important  in  roleplaying  games  (RPGs)  like  Warhammer 
Fantasy  Roleplay  (WFRP  —  we  pronounce  it  WuffRupp) 
to  explain  your  acronyms  the  first  time  the  word  is  used.  The 
Gamemaster (GM) who runs the game can usually clear up any 
confusion.

Advice:  Our  Characters  are  on  hand  in  box-outs  throughout 
the  book  to  offer  advice  and  options.  Each  discusses  different 
elements  of  the  game.  If  you  want  to  know  more  about  the 
Characters, refer to the WFRP Starter Set.

Your Warhammer
Warhammer  Fantasy  Roleplay  and  the  Old  World  is  a 
phenomenon over 30 years in the making, and we all have our 
own take on this rich and vibrant setting. That’s something we 
really  want  to  celebrate,  and  we  want  your  adventures  to  take 
place in your version of Warhammer. 

Game Text
To help keep the rules clear, this book adopts some standard ways 
of presenting information:

Throughout the book we present as many options as we can so 
that you can tailor the game to your vision, many of which are 
marked clearly with ‘Options:’. If anything contradicts how you 
want to play your game, please feel free to change it.

Game Terms:  All  game  terms  are  capitalised,  so  you  can  tell

the borders of the Glorious empire of his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I are the impenetrable plate armour 

he has erected to protect his people. the empire extends to the seas, or until the land ceases to be of worth, such 
as the wasteland stubbornly clung to by those fools in marienburg. the Bountiful empire of his Imperial majesty emperor 
Karl-Franz I is of course the envy of all those who survey it, turning all eyes to covetousness. But fear not, for his Imperial 
majesty emperor Karl-Franz I is resolute in our defence, with unbreachable fortresses full of indefatigable soldiers at every 
mountain pass, river bridge, and other such strategic locations. 

The Empire is beset by enemies to all sides, and the defence of its borders is often compromised by the 
politicking nobles, from lowly barons to the Elector Counts who rule them. Fortunately, mountain ranges and 
coastlines form a natural barrier along much of the Empire’s borders, all of which provide natural lines of 
defence. Guard duty overlooking a potential invasion route is often a lonely, mind-numbingly dull affair; and, 
when it’s not, chances are the garrison will be overrun long before the alarm is raised. 

many claim the court of his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I is the heart of the empire. the emperor 

himself would strike such lickspittles and point out with wisdom and deep humility that it is instead the countless 
villages of his mighty empire that supply his limitless strength. For it is there his people nobly toil to provide food for 
all, to produce goods and raw materials for trade, and raise doughty warriors for the glorious state armies that protect us. 
It is a simple life, satisfyingly full of blessed toil, which is its own reward. In many ways, we desk-bound scholars, while 
unswerving in our duty to his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I, are truly envious of life in this rural paradise.

Far from the courts, peasants tirelessly work the land, much as they have for longer than any can 
remember. The village boundary is, for most, the end of their world. Some might travel to neighbouring 
settlements, but such journeys are viewed with trepidation. This can lead to xenophobia, which is often 
acutely felt towards nearby settlements, probably due to historic conflict over local resources; so, while a 
visitor from Altdorf may be treated with suspicion, villagers reserve their real hatred for that wretch 
from the hamlet a few miles yonder who stole their grandfather’s chicken. 

By the light of day, villagers may scoff at old tales of monsters, beasts, and daemons, believing in the 
power of their lords and gods to protect them. But as the sun sets over the forest and fields, all lock 
their doors securely and, in flickering candlelight, exchange nervous glances at any unexpected sound.

It is said the mighty rivers bear the lifeblood of the resplendent empire of his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I, 

flowing from the mineral-laden mountains to bring wealth and prosperity for all. The masters of robust riverboats and 
barges keep a lucrative flow of goods moving from the furthest reaches of the Empire of His Imperial Majesty Emperor 
Karl-Franz I to the bustling cities and ports, bringing riches beyond compare. this is all made possible by the eternal 
vigilance and unstinting protection offered by his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I’s Imperial navy and Imperial 
River Patrol, who efficiently guard all of His river-borne citizens allowing them to concentrate on their admirable hard work 
without pause for fear or doubt.

If the rivers bear the Empire’s lifeblood, the arteries and veins they flow through are in dangerously 
poor condition. The Imperial Navy patrols the wide flows of the primary rivers, and Riverwardens 
theoretically keep watch everywhere else, but minor waterways can go months without seeing a hint of the 
Emperor’s protection. As a result, wreckers and pirates can be found anywhere outside the immediate 
scrutiny of the authorities, and as the rivers wind through the forest depths, who knows what cruel or 
unnatural creatures wait to ambush passing vessels. When travelling lesser trafficked stretches, wise 
folk should be obviously armed and clearly ready for a fight in the hope of persuading those with ill 
intent to allow them to pass in favour of easier pickings. 

the docks of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I’s ports are engineering marvels established to profit from 

His shrewd trade policies and diplomatic brilliance. Dealing firmly and authoritatively with lesser realms, yet always 
with magnanimity, his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I has ensured our extraordinary prosperity through lucrative 
treaties with a range of diverse peoples including the fading power of the elves from across the sea, the barbaric Kislevites 
to the east, and the short-sighted Wastelanders who cannot survive without the food we generously provide. But these fade 
into inconsequentiality when compared to the profound alliance his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I unstintingly 
maintains with the redoubtable dwarfs of the mountains, a wise accord that has stood since it was initiated by holy sigmar 
Himself, First Emperor and God-King of us all!

The docks are indeed a major centre of the Empire’s power and prosperity, although the reliance on the 
trade they bring is often downplayed in courtly circles. While this is certainly due in part to the nobility’s 
disdain for commerce, it also goes against an instinct for stubborn self-reliance and a belief in their 
ongoing ascendency. In reality, other realms extend their power into the Empire’s ports, and none more so 
than the Wasteland. Marienburg merchant houses have significantly more influence over trade than any 
Reiklander will admit, and heavily armed Wastelander vessels often accompany their goods barges into 
the Empire. This is ostensibly to protect against piracy, but in practice it guards against an ‘accidental’ 
attack by the Imperial Navy, and also openly demonstrates the growing confidence and military might of 
the Wasteland. 

the powerful and awe-inspiring towns and cities of the prosperous empire are the crown jewels of his Imperial majesty 

emperor Karl-Franz I’s realm. rich, cultured, pious, educated, and thriving, their extraordinary planning and awe-
inspiring architecture are the envy of all, and bring wide-eyed travellers from across the world to witness their magnificence. 
under the nurturing rule of his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I, each of his multitudinous subjects have 
opportunities to better themselves and rise to lofty new stations. even the simple folk of the empire, despite their lowly and 
often distasteful appearance, are industrious and optimistic, always seeking new opportunities for the betterment of all.

The major settlements of the Empire may feature some of the most impressive architecture, glorious 
palaces, and inspirational temples, but these are all surrounded by disgusting filth and squalor, 
staggering inequality, and incredible levels of crime and disorder. The upper classes are frequently drunk 
on the power they wield, or corrupted by something much worse, and so the possibility of positive change 
and improvement in conditions is negligible. This leads to social disorder, agitators brewing discontent, 
and all-too-many desperate people with little to lose.

the simple, yet glorious inns of his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I’s empire are part of what binds his loyal 

people together. his Imperial majesty emperor Karl-Franz I himself is said to frequent them in cunning disguises in 
order to share in the jolly camaraderie and simple pleasures of the thankful common folk, whilst graciously not over-awing 
these good, honest people with His astonishing Imperial Magnificence. The Empire’s finest fare can be found in these 
palaces of the people, and your humble scribe heartily recommends pickled trotter as a digestive aid.

Inns and taverns are a distraction from the misery of existence for many citizens of the Empire, and 
an entertaining diversion for many more. They can often be places where political agitators do their work 
to whip up sentiment against the authorities, or where witch hunters prowl for rumours of the unnatural. 
Con artists and robbers also ply their trade amongst the inebriated unwary, although there is also some 
honest respite to be had, and the scribe is right about the pickled trotter.

c/o Colonel Reikhardt Mathis Sievers of the Imperial Ostlanders
Wolfenburg’s 2nd Regiment of Foot
Stationed in Khypris
The Border Princes

32nd Sigmarzeit, 2511 I C

My Lord Konrad von Siert, Baron of Siert and Castellan of Ostergrootsch,
~
Greetings and salutations,

~

Herein find a summons and general information concerning the Empire, your homeland.

~

I am instructed to inform you that your lord and father, Duke Ottokar von Siert, officially recognises your claim to inherit his land 
and titles within the Reikland, and orders you to his side. Your exile in the Border Princes is at an end, and you must make immediate 
preparations for departure. 

~

In his wisdom, your father has employed an armed escort to assist. I am in command, and, Sigmar willing, will arrive sometime near 
Sonnestill. You will leave with us for the Imperial capital the following morning. Surely, such news will fill your young heart with joy, for 
you will finally witness the splendour of the greatest city in the Old World: Altdorf the magnificent, seat of Emperor Karl-Franz I 
and the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar, and current residence of House Siert, where your father holds court not far from the Imperial Zoo 
on Goellner Hill.

~

~

I shall also take your education in hand. Those advising your father believe the present tuition you receive from Colonel Sievers, whilst 
certainly admirable, is too focussed on southern matters as epitomised by Holy Myrmidia - a goddess without reproach when it comes to 
the military, I’m sure, but hardly an expert concerning Reiklander rulership. It was decided by your father’s advisors that a true devotee 
of Sigmar - the Empire’s patron deity - should promptly take charge of your education. Your father, of course, agreed, for the Cult of 
Sigmar should always be heeded.

~

~

Sadly, I must report poor Sister Bartalin, the nun assigned to this important duty, passed through Morr’s Portal when our party was 
but five days from Altdorf.  She was the victim of a most unfortunate accident involving a bedpan, a wilted stick of celery, and a nasty 
fall. Thus, I humbly take her stead. For, no matter my feelings on the subject, your schooling is imperative; you have yet to set foot in the 
Empire, and you will be lost without proper instruction.

~

~

Before we begin, let us turn to introductions: I am Guardian Alanna Graumann of the Grey Order - and let me pre-empt your 
assumptions: yes, I am a witch; and, yes, my name is a pseudonym. I have been in the service of your father for over fifteen years, acting as 
an aide, military advisor, and bodyguard, amongst other things, and am now charged to ensure you, his newly declared heir, reach Altdorf 
alive. To guarantee this I will, as mentioned, attend to your education, which will start immediately. 

~

~

~

~

Forget What You Know
There are several matters I would have you consider before I arrive in Khypris. You likely think life in the 
Empire will be much the same as the sunny lifestyle you currently enjoy in the Border Princes - after all, there 
are the same eight days in the week, the same sun and moons, and the same gods. I regret to inform you such 
presumptions are incorrect: the Empire is not like the Border Princes, and you are ill-prepared for the threats it 
hides. Put plainly: you are not safe, and most of what you think you know will lead you to danger.

~

~

The Gods
As you know, throughout the Old World folk freely worship many different gods, most commonly those directly impacting their daily 
lives. So, if someone is hurt, one prays to Shallya, Goddess of Healing and Mercy; when a hunt fails, one prays to Taal, God of Animals 
and Wild Places; and if crops should wither, one turns to Rhya, Goddess of Life and Fertility. 

~

But in your homeland, one god rises head and shoulders above the others: Sigmar, who founded the Empire when mortal, and now stands 
as its patron deity. In the grand province where your lands lie, the Reikland, the Cult of Sigmar dominates: every village has a temple, 
every town has several, and the capital, Altdorf, has more holy sites dedicated to Sigmar than any bother to count. Each Festag (what the 
locals call the last day of the week - the one you call ‘Holiday’), all are expected to attend ‘throng’ at a local temple, where Sigmar’s priests 
preach lessons concerning the founder of the Empire, he who wielded the Warhammer. Further, many temples require all able-bodied folk 
to train at arms weekly with the local priests or their representatives, forming the core of local militias to support the State Armies. In 
larger towns and cities, it is only the faithful and the lost that attend these weekly duties, but in rural areas, any not attending are viewed 
with deep suspicion. Trust me, my lord, this is a cult you will need to understand, for most folk of the Reikland are ingrained with its 
customs, and you must appear to be, also. You may think you understand Sigmar because there is a shrine in Khypris. You do not.
~

~

~

Witches
One cannot talk of Sigmar without also discussing witches - those able to use magic. Obviously, it’s a subject close to my heart, although 
I prefer to be called a Magister, as I am trained by the Colleges of Magic. The folk of the Empire, like all peoples of the Old World, are 
solid and practical, and quick to remove dangerous elements from their communities. Given the Cult of Sigmar preaches that Sigmar was 
tempted and betrayed by evil witches, it will come as no surprise that in areas of strong Sigmar worship, witches are not just viewed with 
suspicion, they are vilified. Fortunately, the talent for witchery is very rare, but for those born with it any unexpected manifestation of their 
arcane powers may see them burned at the stake, even if Imperial Law states they should be taken to the Colleges of Magic.

~

~

~

~

~

The Colleges of Magic
There is no formal centre of magical learning in the Border Princes. Those able to do magic either work it out independently, accidentally 
kill themselves, are hunted down, or find a master to teach them. Most such masters practice ancient forms of magic that are certainly 
~
dangerous, ranging from supposedly benign hedge witches and seers to those who risk their very souls, including power-blinded fools like 
necromancers and daemonologists. In the Empire, it’s very different. To practice any magic you must have a licence, and the only way to 
secure one is to be a graduated Wizard of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, or be an Elf - they receive special dispensation for their part in 
founding the Colleges - assuming they register with the Colleges, of course. If you have no licence and cast magic, you are breaking the law and 
should be either taken to the Colleges for proper training or tried as a criminal. Most commonly, illegal witches are tried by mob and lynched. 
Which, to be clear, is also illegal, although few are punished for this crime as most would prefer to see a witch dead, regardless of the legality. 
While murdering suspected witches may sound extreme to your ears, there are good reasons for caution: all witches channel the Winds of 
Magic, invisible flows of power that course across the world, and many claim these Winds originate from the Ruinous Powers.

~

~

~

The Ruinous Powers
The less I speak of this the better, and might I suggest you never speak of it. There is always something listening. At its simplest, whatever 
your current tutors pretend, the dark gods do exist. They whisper of the ruination of all things, and too many fools listen. But do the 
Winds of Magic blow from the Ruinous Powers, turning good folk into witches, and twisting minds and flesh in their wake ? That’s 
not a question I think I can answer. What I can say is that the dark gods’ influence is felt at all levels of society, and those drawing too 
close are always changed by what they encounter. This is why folk are terrified of mutation: they believe it is a mark of damnation, a sign 
the dark gods now hold your soul. Even talking in the most general terms about such subjects may well bring you to the attention of the 
witch hunters, so remain wary for signs of this dark corruption but do not betray that you are even aware of its existence.

~

~

The Powers That Be
‘In the Borderlands, all may come to power, and all may come to rule!  In the Empire, we willingly wrap ourselves in chains!’

~

Those were the ardent words of a young, idealistic agitator I met in Wissenburg. Consider what she says, for you will soon encounter those 
who believe it true. In the Empire, you are born to a station, and no amount of cleverness or capability will change what the gods plan, or 
so those in power repeatedly claim. If you are born noble, you are forever noble; born farming, forever farming. And so it remains. But as 
you personally know, my lord, the chance offerings of birth can be changed and manipulated by forces far from divine. And even in the 
Empire, new freedoms are being bought every day.

~

~

The Cities and Towns
For all the stratified layers of society are supposedly immutable, the flourishing towns and cities of the Empire, safely wrapped with high 
walls of stone and patrolled by liveried State Soldiers, have allowed a new class of rich merchants and burghers to rise. The Reikland, as 
the richest of all the Empire’s grand provinces, has a growing ‘middle’ class of such enormity it frequently rises to prominence, with rich 
individuals buying their way to freedom and power. An example of this are towns called ‘Freiburgs’ or ‘free towns’, meaning they self-
govern without significant interference from the nobility in return for services, military support, or, most commonly, large quantities of coin. 
Although the concept of a Freiburg is old, never have so many been seen in such a small area as increasingly more towns are buying their 
freedom; although all this seemingly changes nothing for those toiling in the fields.

~

~

~

Rural Life
Where the towns and cities are becoming freer, it could be argued the opposite is the case for many rural communities. Over two hundred 
years ago, Emperor Magnus the Pious famously enshrined the rights of all to be paid for their labour, but many noble houses did not agree 
with this attack on their rights and continue to resist to this day. 

~

Enlightened provinces such as the lands ruled by your father, where farmers work land they lease, selling any produce they harvest at local 
markets for personal profit, paying taxes as determined by the local authorities, are widespread. But in some isolated regions the peasantry 
are forced to slave on farms they do not own, turning over almost all produce to their lieges, living in total ignorance of the freedoms the 
Imperial Law grants them. Many folk will put up with a lot so long as horns echo across the land each campaign season as noble lords 
send the State Army to rid the encroaching forest of whatever foulness has gathered.

~

~

~

~

And it is there one of the greatest differences between your current home in Khypris and Sigmar’s Holy Empire lies: the endless forests. 
The Empire is blanketed in dense woodlands, and few dare venture into their depths, for their twisted branches hide far worse than simple 
bandits, beastmen, and forest goblins.

~

Travel
Bisecting the Border Princes, the Khyprian Road is famous for its relative safety. Its entire six-hundred mile length is cleared on both 
sides for many miles, ensuring would-be bandits have few places to hide. The opposite circumstances apply in the Empire. Almost all the 
major roads cut through thick forests with uncounted ambush points, leaving travel by foot extraordinarily dangerous. Thus, wealthy 
folk travel by river as most major towns are connected by river or canal, and the major waterways of the Empire are often so wide you can 
barely see the opposite banks - let alone any potential wreckers hiding in the rushes - making them significantly safer than tree-lined 
highways where bandits lurk around every corner.

~

~

~

~

~

Of course, sometimes a road journey is the only option, especially when one is travelling to one of the many highland fortifications or mining 
towns. In such circumstances, I recommend you travel by coach. These not only provide comfortable travelling conditions between all major 
~
destinations, but their routes are patrolled by road wardens, making them relatively safe. The Empire is also significantly more civilised 
than the Border Princes, so boasts many reliable coaching houses.

~

~

Patrols
Recognising the threat posed by highway pillagers, all the major roads of the Reikland are patrolled by mounted squads of road wardens. 
Most are peacetime State Army cavalrymen put to use by local nobles, but some are privately hired, often by merchant or coaching houses, 
to better maintain the peace and protect expensive assets. When travelling away from the primary trade routes, the roads are not so well 
maintained, and some are lucky to ever see a road warden, so I suggest avoiding these dark corners of the Empire, for the local folk are often 
all-too-quick to take offense, all your trappings, and perhaps even your life.
~

~

~

The rivers are similarly patrolled, but by strong-backed riverwardens in a variety of different vessels ranging from small patrol boats to 
small warships called Shipswords. These wardens are supported by the Imperial Navy, which is, against all the expectations of outsiders, 
based in the Reiksport at Altdorf, hundreds of miles upriver from the sea. The navy’s large warships patrol the waters to Marienburg, 
where the river Reik is often many miles wide, and very deep.

~

The Law
The powers granted to wardens patrolling the rivers and roads, and to the watch patrolling the streets of the Empire’s towns and cities, 
vary significantly from province to province. Small infractions of the law normally result in stern words and spot fines, most of which 
never leave the pocket of the lawman concerned. In larger towns and cities, it is also common to find petty courts run by watch captains 
who judge cases brought before them, handing out fines of a shilling or two for most misdeeds, with serious crimes referred to a higher 
authority. For such crimes, the accused is taken before a local court, most commonly officiated by a judge, noble, magistrate, or a cleric of the 
Goddess of Justice, Verena. These trials are rarely fair, so it is wise to never let matters proceed so far.

~

As a lord of the Reikland, you cannot be tried by a normal court, so should you ever find yourself accused, do not be afraid to make 
your birthright known. Should I not be with you, send word to the Grey College and ask for me by name. I will come. To be sure you 
understand, only your father, as your lord, has the right to judge you. However, another noble may appeal against your father’s judgement; 
should this occur, only the High Lord Steward of the Reikland has the right to overrule your father in matters of criminal law.

~

But such almost never happens. The High Lord Steward has not held court for over fifty years, for most nobles are too powerful to bring 
to task. Instead, deals are made, charges are dropped, and the problems disappear.

Be Careful
So, given the many risks, I hope you can understand why your father sends an escort to ensure your safety. Your inexperience with the 
folk of the Empire could easily lead to disaster. For all you may think a local watchman is there to help you, or a riverwarden seems a 
helpful fellow, they may be as corrupt as the folk they are tasked to detain. This is why I come. Let my experience be your teacher, so you need 
not learn from your own errors, which could prove fatal. There is a reason I use a pseudonym, and why I feel it is important not to say 
aught openly.

~

There is, after all, hidden motivations behind all matters. Even this letter.
~

I look forward to seeing you when you understand. Be careful.

With faith,

A G ra u ma n n

Grey Guardian Alanna Graumann
Your servant and guardian.

Players explore the Old World through the eyes of their Character. 
This  chapter  shows  you  how  to  make  your  own  Character  from 
scratch. Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the 
Empire — possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess 
it. That’s  not  to  say  you  can’t  rise  from  humble  origins,  just  that 
you’ve got a long journey ahead, and that you’ll probably need a 
better pair of boots. 

All  the  information  describing  your  Character’s  abilities  is 
recorded  on  a  Character  Sheet  (see  page  344).  We  provide 
ready-made  Characters  and  sheets  in  the WFRP Starter Set, 
and  online  at  cubicle7.co.uk.  Using  ready-made  Characters  is 
a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, 
but  sooner  or  later  you’ll  want  to  create  your  own  from  the 
ground  up.  If  you  are  choosing  a  ready-made  Character,  it’s 
still worth looking through this chapter, as it will explain what 
the different parts of the Character Sheet mean (especially the 
summary on page 44).

When  deciding  what  your  Character  will  be  like,  discuss  the 
kind  of  group  you  want  to  create  with  the  other  players. This 
makes sure that the group’s Characters complement each other 
and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of 
abilities.  Your  GM  may  also  have  a  particular  kind  of  game 
in mind, and you’ll need to make sure you have the right mix 
of  Characters.  Perhaps  the  GM  plans  for  you  to  join  a  group 
of  apprentice  wizards  who  know  one  another  at  the  Colleges 
of  Magic?  Maybe  you  are  part  of  a  unit  of  soldiers  who  have 
all  deserted?  Or  maybe  you  are  one  of  a  disparate  band  of 
Reiklanders  press-ganged  into  service  by  a  powerful  noble? 
Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character 
which will be more fun to play.

CReaTing a ChaRaCTeR
The first thing you’ll need is a blank Character Sheet (see page 
344 or the downloads section of cubicle7.co.uk), or a scrap sheet 
of paper. Once you have that, you’ll follow nine steps to create 
your character. As you move through the nine steps, you’ll record 
the information about your character as you go. 

In  some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the 
result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive 
bonus  Experience  Points  (XP)  for  choosing  to  accept  random 

24

outcomes,  as  if  the  Dark  Gods  of  Chaos  themselves  applaud 
your  acceptance  of  random  chance.  XP  represent  learning 
from  experience  and  are  the  principal  way  to  improve  your 
abilities  —  you  will  be  able  to  spend  these  points  to  enhance 
your  character’s  abilities.  XP  are  covered  in  more  detail  in 
Advancement on page 43.

hUmans (ReiklandeR)
Humans are the most numerous and widespread of the civilised 
species  of  the  Old  World.  From  the  plains  of  the  Estalian 
Kingdoms  to  the  frozen  oblasts  of  Imperial  Kislev,  Humans 
occupy  every  corner  of  the  continent,  and  they  thrive.  The 
largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork 
of  powerful  provinces  blanketed  in  seemingly  endless  forests. 
Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its 
richest, most cosmopolitan region.

Many  Reiklanders  see  it  as  their  divine  right  to  rule,  for  the 
patron  god  of  the  Empire,  Sigmar,  was  himself  a  Reiklander 
before  he  ascended  to  godhood  many  centuries  ago.  Temples 
and shrines to the god are found everywhere, and the majority of 
Reiklanders are devout believers in Sigmar’s message of Empire 
and  unity.  Because  of  this,  they  are  significantly  more  friendly, 
open, and optimistic than other folk, since what could possibly 
go wrong for a land that birthed a god? By comparison, outsiders 
often see them as arrogant, over-bearing meddlers who stick their 
unwanted noses into any affair.

their  affluent 

lifestyles  and  pushy  personalities, 
Beyond 
Reiklanders  are  largely  the  same  as  other  Humans.  They  may 
be  shorter-lived  than  other  species,  but  Humans  possess  more 
vigour,  versatility,  and  ambition.  They  also  have  a  seemingly 
inextricable relationship with the insidious horrors of the Ruinous 
Powers, with more Humans falling to corruption than any other 

species. Perhaps it’s no surprise the declining elder species grow 
increasingly  concerned  the  meteoric  rise  of  Humanity  could 
result in cataclysm. 

Opinions
On Dwarfs…
‘They’ve been our allies since Sigmar walked this very city; 
fought with them meself back in ’05. Sure, they’re a bit stubborn, 
seriously vindictive and pretty blunt, but I won’t hear a word said 
against them.’

– Reikäger Jungling, State Soldier from Altdorf

On Halflings…
‘If I gets meself the sort wot eats and smokes all day, then I’m 
happy as Ranald in catnip. It’s when I get them without proper 
manners nicking me crockery or knives and forks: that I just can’t 
abide! They’re all smiles and shrugs when the watch come to pick 
’em up, like they don’t understand what they done wrong.’

– Stefan Krause, Innkeeper from Stirgau

On High Elves…
‘Yes, I do trade with them. And, no, don’t be ridiculous, I’ve never 
been turned to a pillar of salt just by looking at them. Truly, I find 
them graceful and urbane. Proper civilised, I’d say. But, ’tween you 
and me, if Verena were to ask, I might also say I find them just… 
odd. So very intense. Like every deal we make really matters.’

– Dorothea Taalenstein, Merchant from Kemperbad

On Wood Elves…
‘Elves of the forest you say? Ain’t none of ’em around here, mate. 
You want to be goin’ south to Bretonnia. I hear they gots loads of 
them, and that they’re completely horrible!’

– Siggina Gerster, Bawd from Ubersreik

dwaRfs
Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff 
and  stubborn.  While  the  majority  reside  in  vast  mountainside 
fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of 
the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish 
nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts 
wherever  they  settle.  Many  of  the  Dwarfs  living  in  Reikland 
are  the  descendants  of  those  driven  from  Fallen  Holds  many 
centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the 
Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone 
a mountain.

Dwarf  culture  respects  skill  in  crafting  —  chiefly  stonework, 
smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent 
with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, 
mining  deep  beneath  the  mountains  in  the  pursuit  of  precious 
metals  and  gemstones.  However,  more  than  these  material 
possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have 
entire  religions  focussing  upon  important  progenitors.  Dwarfs 
cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with 
intricate runes to harness magical power.

However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some 
of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are 
mistaken for magic by simpler folk. 

Dwarfs  are  squat  with  thick,  muscular  limbs  and  stout,  broad 
torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of 
hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate 
braids  and  adornments  demonstrating  rank:  to  shave  a  Dwarf 
causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a  fundamental aspect of 
their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they 
bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, 
gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on 
the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will 
be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. 
Whilst it might be hard for others to win  a Dwarf ’s  friendship, 
once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal 
Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as 
long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down 
in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.

On Halflings…
‘They’re just not my kind of folk. Always smiling. Always 
fidgeting. Always talking. Always moving in big groups that 
just won’t shut up! When they come in my store, I like to shoo 
them off with a broom. Really, what have they got to be so happy 
about? I just don’t trust them.’

– Helgi Galannasniz, Burgher from Schrabwald

On High Elves…
‘Don’t talk to me about those bloody bastards! Alrug Skycaster, 
my ultimate granduncle, was bloody betrayed in the bloody 
War of bloody Vengeance by those… those… ARGH! It’s our 
clan’s oldest grudge! Stood for thousands of bloody years! When 
I find the descendants of bloody Galanthiel Whisperthorn, by 
Grungni! I’m going to teach them all — every single last one of 
them — a lesson in manners with my axe!’

– Snorrt Leivvusson, Diplomat from Karak Ziflin

On Wood Elves…
‘My great grandfather thought logging forests on t’other side of 
the Grey Mountains would be lucrative. Ignored all the warnings, 
he was sure he was onto a winner. What could a bunch of skinny 
Elves do to him and his lads, after all? A lot, as it turned out. Only 
my grandfather survived, left alive to spread the message: “Keep 
away.” So, me and my lads are preparing a party to take revenge.’
– Merig Ranvigsdottir, Villager from Azorn-Kalaki

optIons: anImosIty (elves)
Given  the  long  memories  of  dwarfs  and  their  tendency  to 
bear grudges, many harbour a deep resentment towards elves 
for their part in the War of vengeance. as such, many dwarfs 
have  the  Animosity  (elves)  Psychology  trait  (see  page  190). 
Given some WFRP parties contain both elves and dwarfs, 
this may lead to unhelpful tensions. so, you may prefer to 
ignore this talent between party members..

halflings
Halflings  are  ubiquitous  across  the  Reikland,  found  working 
in  service  industries  in  all  towns,  with  an  entire  district  of 
Reikland’s  capital  of  Altdorf,  known  as  Haffenstadt,  packed 
tight  with  hundreds  of  extended  Halfling  families  supporting 
restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number 
of  street-food  hawkers.  Halflings  are  also  a  common  sight 
in  many  of  Reikland’s  villages,  where  it  is  not  uncommon  to 
find  them  employed  to  staff  an  inn  or  run  a  farm.  They  are 
communal  creatures,  preferring  to  live  in  close-knit  family 
groups,  sharing  houses,  rooms,and  even  beds  with  dozens  of 

Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in 
Reikland all me life. As folk go, they know not to mess with 
my business, and show the respect I deserve, as is right. Yes, 
they’re unreliable, and as changeable as the wind, but they’re also 
resourceful and shrewd, so I’d recommend them as risky business 
partners, as they see solutions I’d not even consider.’

– Garral Herraksson, Jeweller from Eilhart

friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. 
This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with 
the concept of private ownership and space.

Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, 
and  many  Halfling  clans  can  trace  their  ancestry  back  many 
centuries  to  the  very  founding  of  the  Mootland  (their  self-
governed  Grand  Province  in  the  Empire).  The  Elder  of  the 
Moot — currently Hisme Stoutheart — is the custodian of the 
Haffenlyver,  an  ancient  embroidered  scroll  detailing  the  chief 
bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure 
of the Halflings. 

Another  peculiar  detail  is  the  Halflings’  strange  affinity  for 
Ogres. Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating 
whatever  is  at  hand,  Ogres  tend  to  respect  Halflings.  Indeed, 
gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers, 
and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff.

Halflings  are  short,  apple-cheeked  and  beardless,  resembling 
big-eyed,  round-faced  (and  round  bodied)  Human  children, 
and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this 
impression.  They  are  known  for  their  enormous  appetites  in 
all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they’re 
huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me’ great aunt’s just shacked 
up with me best mate, and you should hear what they’ve been 
up to!’), and property rights (‘It’s not like he’s using it!’); this last 
has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery. 

Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous… I could go on, but 
good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like 
me pies. As long as you keep away from their temples and the 
hard-liners, they’re an open and pretty welcoming bunch. Good 
folk, and good for business.’

– ‘Tubs’ Samworth Rumster XVI, Pie-seller from Kalegan

On Dwarfs…
‘My aunt Bessi was the greediest, as were six of her sons. But Bessi 
has nothing on them Dwarfs. Eyes grow as big as Mannslieb at 
even a scratch of gold. But, if you tell them that, they’ll growl 
at you like you’ve taken the last honeycake, and start scribbling 
notes in one of their damned books about insulting their family 
honour or whatnot.’

– ‘Lilly’ Joseppinalina Hayfoot, Pedlar in the Reikland

On High Elves…
‘I’ve seen them on the rivers in their white ships. How do they 
keep them so clean? And their hair… oh, their hair… it’s like 
sunshine, it is. Snuck on a boat once to see what they do. Same as 
the rest of us, it seems, just more... earnestly.’

– ‘Dainty’ Cordelineth Brandysnap IV, Thief from Altdorf

On Wood Elves…
‘Elves living in the woods? Don’t be bloody ridiculous. Elves live 
in white towers and pretty boats over in Altdorf-town, you idiot.’
– ‘Jammy’ Mercimaus Alderflower II, Scholar from Fielbach

high elves
High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland. 
Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High 
Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg 
to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the 
High  Elves  found  in  Reikland,  alongside  diplomatic  entourages 
and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, 
emotional  folk  widely  perceived  in  the  Reikland  to  be  the  most 
beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant.

Tall  and  slender  with  delicately  pointed  ears,  most  Elves  have 
long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look 
frail,  their  physiology  is  not  only  surprisingly  strong,  but  also 
extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable 
gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion 
among Humans who interact with them. 

The  High  Elves,  who  call  themselves  ‘Asur’,  are  native  to 
Ulthuan,  a  magical  island  lying  to  the  west  of  the  Old World. 
A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the 
world’s  civilisations.  High  Elves  show  considerable  disdain  for 
Dwarfs,  with  whom  they  have  a  long  history  of  conflict.  Since 
their  abandonment  of  the  Old  World  in  the  aftermath  of  the 
War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the 
‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with 

27

II

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from 
the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, 
and ruthless. 

High  Elven  society  is  tightly-bound  by  ritual  and  discipline, 
intended  to  keep  soaring  emotions  in  check  and  provide  focus 
for their complicated intellects. Seeming contrary to this, some 
Asur revel in wild adventure. The term ‘Sea Elf ’ is often used by 
other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture 
beyond Ulthuan’s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats, 
and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying 
them who follow warrior lifestyles.

Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived 
hungers. But, when mindful of their petty needs and their fear of 
what we represent, they are easily shaped.’

– Imryth Emberfell, Ambassador from Caledor

On Dwarfs…
‘I suggest avoiding them. They are lost in the past, which blinds 
them to what’s coming. Nod politely, accept the abuse, and move 
on. There is no point arguing, they will never change their minds.’
– Alathan Crestrider, Seaman from Cothique

On Halflings…
‘I find these cheerful creatures genuinely interesting. I lived 
amongst an extended family group for a while, and found them 
so open, welcoming, and nurturing it was authentically touching. 
But, eventually, I had to move on, the smell was simply over-
powering, and they have no understanding of personal space, 
which soon loses its charm.’

– Hoelistor Arceye, Wizard from Saphery

On Wood Elves…
‘If the Asrai would bother to look beyond their dirty noses, they 
would see what we are all up against. Isolationist idiots that 
deserve everything that’s coming to them. I doubt the Eonir are 
any better.’

– Anaw-Alina Darkstep, Scout from Nagarythe

wood elves
Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason. 
During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves 
retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew 
to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over 
three  thousand  years  of  isolation,  hardship,  and  warfare  then 
ensued,  leaving  ‘Wood  Elves’  culturally  very  different  to  their 
High Elf cousins. 

Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed 
with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to 
hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed 
with  powerful  illusions  and  misleading  magics.  On  the  rare 
occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as 
often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other 
peoples  of  the  Old  World  deeply  unsure  of  the  fae,  capricious 
Elves.

There  are  two  kiths  of  Wood  Elves  most  commonly  seen 
in  Reikland.  The  ‘Asrai’  from  Athel  Loren  across  the  Grey 
Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north 
in Nordland.

The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, 
and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, 
Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. 
In  response,  the  King  and  Queen  of  the  Wood,  recognising 
the  fate  of  their  forests  may  lay  in  the  hands  of  outsiders,  sent 
tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting 
the enemies of the forest at the source. 

These  ferocious  bands  are  sometimes  led  by  a  spellsinger  who 
calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport 
them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long 
lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. 
Occasionally,  these  wild  hunters  perceive  some  common  cause 
with  other  Old Worlders  and  an  individual  may  step  from  the 
shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.

28

By  comparison,  the  Queen  of  the  Laurelorn  takes  a  very 
different  path  to  the  foretellings  given  to  her  and  has  recently 
sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the 
Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human 
politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally 
intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a 
‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word 
is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, 
these  Wood  Elves  are  a  growing  presence  in  Reikland  as  they 
venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable 
purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.

On Halflings…
‘I met one when travelling Middenland during the ninth year of 
Queen Marrisith. It talked a lot. And I do mean a lot. When we 
parted ways by a town it told me was named “Delberz”, I found it 
had somehow managed to steal several pouches of herbs from my 
belt. I was impressed. So, I suggest not trusting the things, but the 
companionship and local lore they share may be worth the cost!’
– Alafael Harrowlay, Entertainer from the Laurelorn

On High Elves…
‘Conceited beyond any sensible measure, don’t approach the Asur. 
They are jaded, arrogant, and likely lost to Atharti. And if they 
try to look down on you in that superior manner they so prefer, 
just remind them their Queen in Avelorn lives a life no different 
to ours.’

– Cynwrawn Fartrack, Hunter from the Laurelorn

sylvan cousIns
the Wood elves of athel loren and the laurelorn may share 
a  common  history  and  origin  in  the  old  World,  but  they 
are culturally different. unlike the high elves, neither of the 
Wood  elven  kiths  care  much  for  any  form  of  conventional 
civilisation, seeing it as a threat to their beloved forests and 
way of life. however, they differ in how they choose to express 
this. 

the laurelorn Wood elves proactively engage in politics to 
protect  themselves,  mixing  with  others,  and  are  not  above 
stoking the fires of hatred between other groups to shift focus 
to  their  preferred  targets. thus,  in  character,  they  are  more 
like the high elves, whilst still having the skills and talents 
of the Wood elves. 

By comparison, the athel loren kinbands prefer to hide in 
the shadows, shunning contact with all others, instead striking 
deadly blows designed to cause fear and terror in the hearts of 
any who would look to the forest with greed.

Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a 
complete disrespect for order. But they are widespread, warlike, 
and, most importantly, easy to manipulate. Given winter draws 
near, it is time to use them.’

– Algwyllmyr Twiceseen, Seer from Athel Loren

On Dwarfs…
‘More stubborn than the Oak of Ages, they understand one 
argument only: force. So, use it swiftly and decisively, and be 
aware they will return for petty vengeance at a later date.’

– Meridrynda Aspengate, Glade Rider from Athel Loren

Class
Summary: Choose one of the eight Classes.

Your  choice  of  Class  determines  from  which  Careers  you  can 
choose. The Careers under each Class are of a broadly equivalent 
social  level  that  offer  similar  types  of  opportunities  between 
adventures. 

Academics: Learned people who use their education to make a 
living.  Often,  Academics  are  the  only  characters  who  can  read 
and write. They start with low Status but can secure important 
positions  if  they  advance  through  the  ranks.  Career  options: 
Apothecary,  Engineer,  Lawyer,  Nun,  Physician,  Priest,  Scholar, 
Wizard.

middle class and earn a decent living. Career options: Agitator, 
Artisan, Beggar, Investigator, Merchant, Rat Catcher, Townsman, 
Watchman.

Courtiers: Those who rule or who provide specialist services to 
those  who  rule.  Even  lowly  born  Courtiers  have  higher  Status 
than  most,  and  all  have  an  opportunity  to  secure  positions  of 
significant  influence.  Career  options:  Advisor,  Artist,  Duellist, 
Envoy, Noble, Servant, Spy, Warden.

Peasants: People  who  live  and  work  in  the  farms,  villages,  and

comfortable life. Career options: Boatman, Huffer, Riverwarden, 
Riverwoman, Seaman, Smuggler, Stevedore, Wrecker.

Rogues: Mostly town and city folk, these people make a living by

of money, though they may not secure a high Status when doing 
so.  Career  options:  Bawd,  Charlatan,  Fence,  Grave  Robber, 
Outlaw, Thief, Racketeer, Witch.

Warriors:  Relying  on  their  physical  prowess,  these  people  are 
all  trained  fighters,  although  they  are  not  necessarily  from  the 
military. Warriors come from many backgrounds, both high and 
low Status, and all can carve out a position of influence if they live 
long  enough.  Career options:  Cavalryman,  Guard,  Knight,  Pit 
Fighter, Protagonist, Soldier, Troll Slayer, Warrior Priest.

Summary: Choose one of your Class’s Careers, restricted by your 
Species. 

Once  your  Class  is  established,  choose  one  of  the  Careers 
associated with it. There are 8 Careers in each Class, but some 

are restricted by Species. Full descriptions of each Career and 
their  restrictions  are  given  in  Chapter  3:  Class  and  Careers,

you  may  have  a  great  idea  for  a  character  excluded  by  the 
rules because normally the species in question doesn’t pursue 
such a career for cultural, religious, or philosophical reasons. 
That’s totally fine! Just take your character concept to your

3) AttRibuteS

Summary: Determine each of your Attributes by referring to the 
Attributes Table.

Attributes describe your character’s innate capabilities – how fast 
or strong you are, how much damage you can sustain, or how well 
you cope with stressful situations. Attributes include Movement, 
ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience. 

WAIT! THAT’S nOT FAIR!
you  may  notice  that  not  all  characters  are  created  equal. 
An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example. 
don’t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects 
to character generation and all the species have advantages and 
disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.

ChaRaCTeRisTiCs
Your  ten  Characteristics  are  used  in  Tests  (see  Chapter  5: 
Rules), to determine if you perform an action successfully. The 
Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, 
or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most 
dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, 

other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their 
averages are different, sometimes significantly so.

Determining Characteristics
When determining your Characteristics: 

Step  1)  Roll  2d10  for  each  of  the  ten  Characteristics  and 
make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be 
improved  if  you  swapped  round  some  of  the  dice  roll  results 
between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with 
your  random  results,  add  the  die  rolls  to  the  modifier  for  each 
Characteristic  from  the  Attribute  Table,  write  them  on  your 
Character Sheet and gain +50 XP. 

Step 2) Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning 
each  to  a  different  Characteristic  (and  adding  its  modifier).  If 
you’re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character 
Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.

Step 3) If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again 
and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore 
the  dice  completely!  Instead,  allocate  100  points  across  the  10 
Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum 
of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from 
the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like 
rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.

Weapon Skill (WS)
Your  skill  at  fighting  hand-to-hand,  your  ability  to  land  a 
measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed 
melee.  It  is  also  used  for  unarmed  combat,  where  your  body  is 
the weapon!

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Ballistic Skill (BS)
Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and 
throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used 
as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.

woUnds (w)
Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on 
your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See  
Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.

Strength (S)
How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and 
how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.

Toughness (T)
Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat 
but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and 
standing up to poison.

Initiative (I)
Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and 
when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you 
be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of 
intuition and perception.

Agility (Ag)
Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for 
things  like  running,  riding,  and  hiding.  Agility  is  also  used  for 
dodging blows in combat.

Dexterity (Dex)
Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like 
playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also 
help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.

Intelligence (Int)
Your  powers  of  thought,  analysis,  and  understanding.  Useful 
for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the 
understanding and casting of magical spells.

Willpower (WP)
General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty 
and  plough  on  with  the  job  in  hand.  It  helps  with  resisting  all 
sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.

Fellowship (Fel)
Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally 
pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or 
commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting 
to  bribe  them,  and,  for  pious  characters,  communicating  with 
your deity.

Characteristic Bonuses
The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. 
Characteristic  Bonuses  are  used  in  a  variety  of  different  ways 
throughout  the  rules,  particularly  for  limiting  Talents  and 
defining Spells. 

Example: Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. 
Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5.

Determining Wounds
Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength 
Bonus,  twice  your  Toughness  Bonus,,  and  Willpower  Bonus 
(abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer 
to  the  Attributes Table  to  determine  the  Characteristic  Bonuses 
used  to  calculate  your  Wounds.  Note:  Halflings  have  the Small 
Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see page 341).

faTe & foRTUne, ResilienCe & Resolve
Your  Fate  represents  your  destiny,  and  is  directly  tied  to  your 
Fortune,  a  measure  of  your  luck.  Your  Resilience  is  your  inner 
strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your 
grit.  Your  Resilience  also  comes  with  a  Motivation,  which  is  a 
single  word  or  phrase  describing  what  drives  your  character 
forwards. See page 170 for more on all of these.

Determining Fate and Resilience
You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have 
a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes 
as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes 
Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. 
By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through 
any situation.

Determining Fortune and Resolve
Your  initial  Fortune  is  equal  to  your  Fate.  Your  initial  Resolve 
equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.

Determining Motivation
All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character’s 
core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In 
addition  to  the  obvious  roleplaying  benefits  for  portraying  your 
character,  Motivation  is  used  to  help  you  regain  Resolve  points.
When  considering  your  Motivation,  think  of  something  that 
is fundamental to your character’s nature. Also try to make your 
Motivation  something  fun  to  roleplay,  and  something  that  will 
work well with the other PCs and their motivations.

Example: Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, 
has ‘Thrillseeker’ for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of 
excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points 
when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes 
antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing 
the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers. 

Example: Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has ‘Protect the weak’ as 
her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, 
risking life and limb to save the Reikland’s citizenry. Clotilda will 
regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in 
harm’s way to protect another.

Example: Ebba is a ‘Rebellious’ apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master’s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.Other examples of potential motivations include: a ‘Perfectionist’, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a ‘Nurturer’, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a ‘Penitent Martyr’, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a ‘Shining Wit’, who’s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can’t think of a Motivation don’t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it’s possible you may change your mind later. Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.Movement (M)Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see page 164MovementWalkRun3612481651020AdvAnce chArActeristicsTurn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers. Look to the Advance Scheme and find the three Characteristics marked h without a brass, silver, or gold background.

A list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The Skills and Talents you have available to you at character generation are determined by your Species and Career.When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you gain in the Advances box of the Skill. If you should learn this skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a new number of Advances. If you learn a Talent, record it in your Talent list on your Character Sheet.Skills are classified as either Basic or Advanced. Basic Skills represent common abilities that everyone can perform — you can use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal to the governing characteristic. Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at least one Advance in them.Note: Some Talents can be learned multiple times. If you have an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the Talent entry in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents to see if it can be learned multiple times, and mark how many times you’ve learned it on your Character Sheet.II

What are Skill advanceS?like characteristic advances, Skill advances show specific training in a Skill. All Skills are associated with a characteristic, and the number of advances you have in the Skill is added to that characteristic to show you how skilled you are. So, as Climb is associated with Strength, if you have a Strength of 38, and 8 Climb Advances, your Climb Skill is 46. This is explained in full in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents.SpecieS SkillS and TalenTSEach Species has a variety of Skills and Talents to choose from. You may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills to gain 3 Advances each. If a Talent listing presents a choice, you select one Talent from the choices given. Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. Note: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not need to take it as a Skill.

You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path. There are 8 Skills and 4 Talents listed with that level, and you can choose which of these you are most proficient at. Allocate 40 Advances to your eight starting Skills, with no more than 10 Advances allocated to any single Skill at this stage. This is enough for you to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48). You may also choose a single Talent to learn.Example: Lindsay is creating a Human Noble Scion, which has the following Career Skills: Bribery, Consume Alcohol, Gamble, Intimidate, Leadership, Lore (Heraldry), Melee (Fencing), Play (Any). She decides the character is well-schooled, but naive, so chooses to ignore the Bribery, Consume Alcohol, and Gamble Skills for the moment, and spreads her 40 Advances like so: Intimidate +7, Leadership +10, Lore (Heraldry) +10, Melee (Fencing) +3, and Play (Harpsichord) +10. Note: Lindsay can do this even if she has already allocated Advances to Leadership for being Human, as the limit of 10 Advances to a single Skill applies only during this allocation of 40 Advances.c h a r ac t e r

5) tRAPPingS

Summary: Determine your initial Trappings from your Class and 
Career.

Your Trappings are the equipment, clothes, weapons, and other 
items your character carries. You begin play with initial Trappings 
determined  by  your  Class  and  your  Career.  If  you  want  to  buy 
more  (or  sell  what  you  already  have!),  refer  to  Chapter  11: 
Consumers’ Guide.

All  your Trappings  should  be  recorded  in  the  relevant  sections 
of your Character Sheet. Once you’ve done this, move on to 6) 
Adding Detail.

Class TRappings
Your  character  begins  play  with  general Trappings  determined 
by your Class. Reference your Class in the list below and jot the 
Trappings into your Character Sheet, rolling dice where required.

Academics: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing 
Writing Kit and 1d10 sheets of Parchment
Burghers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Hat, Pouch, Sling Bag 
containing Lunch
Courtiers: Dagger, Fine Clothing, Pouch containing Tweezers, 
Ear Pick, and a Comb
Peasants: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing 
Rations (1 day)
Rangers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Backpack containing 
Tinderbox, Blanket, Rations (1 day)
Riverfolk: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag 
containing a Flask of Spirits
Rogues: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing 2 
Candles, 1d10 Matches, a Hood or Mask
Warriors: Clothing, Hand Weapon, Dagger, Pouch

CaReeR TRappings

Every Career has a list of Trappings for each of its four levels. You 
begin  play  with  all  the Trappings  listed  in  the  first  level  of  your 
Career  Path.  Find  the  appropriate  Trappings  list  in  Chapter  3: 
Class and Careers and record them on your Character Sheet. 

Next,  find  your  character’s  Status,  which  is  listed  beside  your 
Career level’s name. It will be marked as either Brass, Silver or 
Gold, which is you Status Tier, followed by a a number, which 
is your Standing. Your Status Tier and Standing determine your 
initial wealth as shown below.

Status Tier 
Brass  
Silver  
Gold  

Starting Wealth
2d10 brass pennies per Status Level
1d10 silver shillings per Status Level
1 Gold crown per Status Level

So, if you were Brass 3, you would start with 6d10 Brass pennies; 
if Silver 3, you would begin with 3d10 silver shillings, and if you 
were Gold 3, you would have 3 gold crowns.

This money can be used to purchase more Trappings or saved for 
spending during play. The relative worth of the coins is covered in 
Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide.

6) Adding detAil

Summary:  Choose name, age, hair and eye colour, height, 
Psychology, and Ambitions.

The  bare  bones  of  your  character  are  in  place,  so  let’s  add  some 
details, fleshing your character out in your imagination, determining 
what you look like, how you think, and what drives you. 

name
While you can choose any name that fits the world, here are some 
hints and tips to help choose one that’s right for you.

Human Reiklander Names
Reiklanders usually have a forename and a surname. Forenames 
include:

Examples: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, 
Erika,  Frauke,  Frederich,  Gerner,  Gertraud,  Haletha,  Heinrich, 
Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, 
Sebastien,  Sigfreda,  Talther,  Talunda,  Ulrich,  Ulrika,  Werther, 
Willelma, Wilryn.

37

II

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Dwarf Surnames
Dwarf  surnames  are  based  on  who  raised  the  Dwarf,  with  the 
following suffixes the most common in use: 

-sdottir: Daughter of…
-snev: Nephew of…
-sniz: Niece of…
-sson: Son of…

Examples: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz

It’s  common  as  Dwarfs  age  and  accrue  deeds  to  their  names 
to  adopt  a  nickname  based  on  physical  appearance,  prowess, 
or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s 
considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent 
the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it 
usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir 
would  become  Gerka  Blackhand  if  she  took  the  nickname 
‘Blackhand’. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but 
Dwarfs  usually  translate  such  to  Reikspiel  in  order  to  better 
explain themselves.

Examples: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, 
Redhammer, Stonefist

Clan Name
Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not 
abandoned  Dwarf  tradition,  which  some  Dwarfs  living  in  the 
Empire  have,  especially  rogue  engineers).  The  Clan  Name  is 
always  derived  from  the  ancestor  who  founded  the  Clan,  and 
is  often  sourced  in  a  Nickname,  often  expressed  in  Khazalid. 
In  practice,  Dwarfs  rarely  use  their  Clan  Name  outside  Dwarf 
society.

Common Reikland Clans: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, 
Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki

Common Grey Mountain Clans: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, 
Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk

Elf Names
Elves  normally  only  admit  to  having  names  comprising  of  a 
forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.

Elf Forenames
The  Elves  use  a  naming  system  quite  incomprehensible  to 
outsiders.  Eltharin  (the  common  language  of  High  Elves  and 
Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on 
more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to 
create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.

Elf Epithets
When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves 
with  a  forename and  an  epithet rather  than  attempt to  explain 
the  deeper  concepts  of  Kindreds,  Kinbands,  or  Houses.  These 
epithets  are  always  translated  into  Reikspiel  as  they  are  much 

human names 
and theIr orIGIns
human names in WFrp are often taken from the real world, 
making it easy to research fun names online. the reikland and 
much of the empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland 
has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are 
loosely medieval French.

In  the  Reikland,  Human  family  surnames  passed  on  from 
one  generation  to  the  next  are  most  common  in  cities  and 
towns,  while  in  villages  Humans  are  more  likely  to  take  on  an 
individual  surname  when  they  reach  adulthood.  It’s  common 
to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm 
of Auerswald’. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the 
name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate 
where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von 
Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.

The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, 
or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: 
Bauer  (Farmer),  Fleischer  (Butcher),  Schmidt  (Smith),  and 
Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable 
physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often 
be passed down from parents to children too, which can become 
confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a 
short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples 
include:  Augenlos  (one  eye),  Dunn  (very  thin),  Laut  (loud 
voice), Stark (Strong).

Dwarf Names
Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan 
name.

Dwarf Forenames
Dwarf  names  tend  to  be  short  and  sturdy  like  the  people  they 
represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important 
ancestors,  although  individual  clan  traditions  vary.  Another 
common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a 
newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.

Examples: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, 
Snorri.

Khazalid examples: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), 
Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril 
(Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)

easier  for  other  species  to  pronounce  and  understand.  Among 
High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical 
appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically 
reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.

High Elf examples: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, 
Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign

Wood Elf examples: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, 
Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner

Halfling Names
Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name 
at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees 
are not confused.

Halfling Forenames
Halflings  proudly  bear  grand  names  drawn  from  their  long 
family  trees,  but  they  rarely  use  these  outside  official  business. 
Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of 
their ancestral name. Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely 
unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, 
like Rosie or Scrumper. 

Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders 
will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, 
Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating 
their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human 
names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names. 

Examples  (with  diminutives):  Antoniella  (Anni),  Esmerelda 
(Esme),  Ferdinand  (Fred),  Heironymus  (Hiro),  Maximilian 
(Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)

Halfling Clan Names
Halfling  clan  names  are  almost  exclusively  related  to  food  and 
drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics 
of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the 
same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly 
how. 

Human’s  tendency  to  have  the  same  surname  despite  being 
unrelated  causes  confusion  among  some  Halflings,  who  will 
happily  pinch  pies  from  a  Schmidt  on  one  street  because  a 
Schmidt on another street short-changed them. 

Common Reikland Clans: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, 
Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble

When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of 
your  appearance  that  don’t  influence  the  game  directly  —  you

Age
Average  natural  lifespans  are  around  60  for  a  Human,  120  for

more. Choose your Character’s age or use the table below.

Eye Colour
While  most  species  roll  once  on  the  table  below,  Elves  may 
roll  twice:  their  innately  magical  natures  mean  they  often  have 
variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a 
mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.

Hair Colour
All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they 
move  through  middle  age,  then  eventually  turns  white  as  they 
reach old age. 

By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any 
signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial 
hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.

Height
Average  heights  are:  Dwarf  (4’8”),  Elf  (6’5”),  Halfling  (3’6”), 
with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere 
around 5’9” in the Reikland. If you want a truly random upper 
height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and 
add it to the height total.

amBiTions
Ambitions  are  a  Character’s  goals  in  life  –  what  they  want  to 
achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term 
Ambition. 

Choosing Ambitions
Consult  with  your  GM  when  choosing  your  Ambitions.  Your 
GM  has  final  say  on  the  acceptability  of  an  Ambition,  and 
whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change 
an Ambition, you may do so between sessions. 

Short-term Ambitions
Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are

sooner.  Under  normal  circumstances,  a  short-term  Ambition 
should take at least two or three sessions to complete.

7) PARty

Example short-term Ambitions include: 

Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.

•	
•	 Avenging a fallen comrade.
•	

Befriending a reclusive scholar. 

Long-term Ambitions
Long-term  Ambitions  are  goals  you  will  need  to  work  on  for 
months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, 
perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in 
your life than a realistic outcome.

Examples of long-term Ambitions include: 

•	 Owning your own coaching inn.
•	
•	

Building your village into a thriving town.
Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence. 

optIons: neFarIous plans
you  may  want  to  keep  your  ambitions  secret  from  other 
players  in  your  party,  especially  if  they  are  controversial  or 
clandestine. If you want to overthrow the emperor, or legalise 
necromancy in the reikland, chances are your Witch hunter 
ally won’t approve!

Achieving Your Ambitions
If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus 
of  +50  XP,  and  can  choose  a  new  short-term  Ambition  at  the 
end of the session.  If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you 
may either:

•	

•	

Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term 
Ambition at the end of the session. 
Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your 
GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP 
of your current character to spend on your next character.

Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of 
their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background 
of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If 
you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about 
how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters 
allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a 
great source of adventure leads. 

Now you have almost finished making your Character, you need 
to  consider  the  other  players  in  your  party.  Everyone  will  have 
more fun when your Characters can engage and interact with one 
another;  while  some  intra-party  tension  can  be  enjoyable,  it  is 
important you are not constantly at one another’s throats. 

You will also want to consider how your party know one another. 
Are you friends?  Are you the retainers  of a  noble,  or  travelling 
companions on a river barge? Or is your GM going to have you 
meet during your first session? 

paRTy amBiTions
All players in your group should also discuss what your collective 
goals  are,  and  then  choose  a  short-term  and  long-term  party 
Ambition. Much like your personal Ambitions, party Ambitions 
can be changed between sessions.

Short-term Party Ambitions
Short-term party Ambitions have the same scope as your personal 
short-term Ambitions but are for the whole group. Your personal 
Ambitions should never be the same as your party Ambitions, but 
there is no reason they can’t complement each other.

II

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Examples of short-term party Ambitions include: 

•	 Outwitting a rival group, securing a job at their loss.
•	 Hunting down the killer of a lost party member.
•	

Impressing  your  patron  by  completely  succeeding  in  an 
appointed task.

like  short-term  party  Ambitions, 

Long-term Party Ambitions 
Much 
long-term  Party 
Ambitions work like your personal Ambitions, and can be just as 
wide in scope, but are for your entire group.

Examples of long-term Party Ambitions include:

•	
•	
•	

Eradicate an Empire-wide Chaos Cult.
Build a castle.
Become  Heroes  of  the  Empire,  each  earning  an  Imperial 
Cross  for  bravery,  pinned  on  your  chests  by  the  Emperor 
himself !

Achieving your Party Ambitions
If  your  party  achieves  its  short-term  Ambition,  each  member 
receives +50 XP, and you can all select a new Ambition for the 
party at the end of the session. 

If your party achieves its long-term Party Ambition:

•	 All players receive a bonus of +500 XP, and the party chooses 
a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. 
•	 As many players as wish to do so can retire their Characters 
— who become NPCs under the GM’s control; those who 
do gain a bonus of half the XP of their current Character to 
spend on their next Character.

8) bRinging youR 
chARActeR to liFe

Fleshing  out  your  Character’s  personality  and  history  will 
really  help  you  bring  them  to  life.  Some  players  write  detailed 
backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar 
with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the 
start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the 
GM beforehand so you don’t derail any storylines). At the start of 
the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to 
the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want 
to  create,  and  we  revisited  that  while  creating  Party  ambitions. 
This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your 
Characters’ stories together and binding them into a tight-knit 
group with their own reasons for sticking together.

here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change 
something about the character you’ve created so far... do so! For 
instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may 
want to revisit the choices you made in 4) Skills and Talents. 

Where are you from?
Do you come from one of Reikland’s bustling towns, or a sleepy 
village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, 
or  maybe  you  called  the  winding  back  alleys  of  Altdorf  home? 
Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent 
threading  the  roads  and  riverways  of  Reikland,  always  on  the 
move?  See  Chapter  10:  Glorious  Reikland  for  details  on  the 
geography and settlements of this corner of the Empire. 

What is your family like?
It  may  take  a  village  to  raise  a  child,  but  it’s  your  kin  who  do 
the heavy lifting. What were your parents’ occupations? Are they 
still  alive?  Do  you  have  any  siblings?  Were  you  close,  or  were 
you constantly at one another’s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, 
nieces,  cousins?  Children,  even?  Does  your  family  approve  of 
your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on 
your family’s honour? 

What was your childhood like?
Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable 
place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself ? 
Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, 
a  village  school,  or  the  local  priest?  Were  you  trained  in  the 
family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere 
or raised in an orphanage? 

Why did you leave home?
Do  you  still  live  in  your  childhood  home,  or  did  you  leave?  If 
so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life 
in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you 
running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose 
in your life?

Who are your best friends?
While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another 
matter  entirely,  and  you  can  tell  a  lot  about  someone  by  the 
friends  they  keep.  Do  you  have  any  friends  from  childhood? 
Or  friends  you’ve  made  since  leaving  home?  What  do  you  do 
together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party 
your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour 
of a loyal pet? 

What is your greatest desire?
What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may 
be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you 
could have anything, anything at all, what would it be? 

Ten QUesTions
One useful technique for creating an interesting background for 
your Character is to answer a series of questions about them — 

What are your best and worst memories?
We  are  the  sum  of  our  experiences;  they  shape  and  mould  us, 
forging  us  anew. What  are  your  most  treasured  memories?  An 
afternoon  of  glorious  summer  sunshine?  A  passionate  kiss, 

42

c h a r ac t e r

while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?What are your religious beliefs?Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally. Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See Chapter 7: Religion and Belief for details of the gods and their ways. To whom, or what, are you loyal?Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire… or just to yourself? Why are you adventuring?And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to spend it before you begin play.OptiOns: psychOlOgyWhen you are creating your character’s story, you might feel you should have powerful emotions such as love, camaraderie, hatred etc towards family members, situations, enemies or other features of their life. if the gM agrees, you can take a psychology trait (see page 190).9) AdvAncementExperience Points (XP) are used to improve your character. The GM will give you XP after every session of play, and you may be rewarded for doing particularly well. This could include successfully resolving the ongoing adventure, roleplaying your character well or defeating important enemies. Between sessions, you spend your XP to buy new Skills and Talents, to increase Characteristics, and to change Career. The final step in creating your Character is to spend any bonus XP you earned through the Character Creation process. The tables below shows how you can spend these points. Initially, you can only spend your XP to increase the 3 Characteristics, 8 Skills, and 4 Talents available to your Career level.

chARActeR Sheet SummARy

Personal Details
Here is where you fill in your Character’s 
personal details, such as name, Species (see 
page 24) and Career (see page 30), as well as 
aspects of their physical appearance. 

Attributes
Record your Attributes here. Attributes 
include your Characteristics (see page 33), 
which describe your Character’s strengths and 
weaknesses. As you progress through your 
game, your Character will gain Advances (see 
page 35), reflecting them getting stronger, 
tougher or better at different tasks. 

Your Movement (see page 35) shows how 
quickly you can move.

Fate and Fortune (see page 170) reflect how 
lucky your character is, while Resilience and 
Resolve (see page 171) indicate your character’s 
pool of grit and determination to overcome 
certain obstacles. You will also need to record a 
Motivation (see page 34), which explains what 
keeps your Character going. 

Skills & Talents
Your Skills (see page 35) are abilities your 
character can train or develop. Basic Skills 
are common or innate and are known by all 
characters, while Advanced Skills require 
training. As you acquire new Skills, mark them 
onto your Character Sheet. As you get gain 
Advances, your Skills will improve, which 
increase your chance of succeeding in Tests (see 
page 149). 

Talents are additional abilities your character 
possesses. As many Talents may be taken more 
than once, keep a tally of how many times you 
have taken each one.

•

Experience
As you play WFRP your Gamemaster will award 
Experience Points (see page 43). Keep a record of 
your current (unspent) Experience, as well as your 
Spent Experience and a running total.

Ambitions
Your Ambitions (see page 41) are your 
Character and party’s main goals in life. 
Short-term Ambitions can be achieved 
within a few days or weeks, while long-
term Ambitions are those that may take 
years, or may never be achieved at all.

Party
Details about your group goes here: the 
name your party is known by, and its 
short-term and long-term Ambitions (see 
pages 41-42). There’s also space to note your 
companions’ names as a reminder to use 
them and help everyone stay in character.

Armour
Record your Armour (see page 299) here. Armour is 
very useful at keeping your character alive, as it reduces 
incoming Damage, and may save you from Critical Hits 
(see page 159). Record the details of your Armour in the 
table, and also write the total Armour Points (APs) in each 
location on the diagram. 

Corruption and Mutation
When you face dark horrors, Daemons, and the machinations of the 
Dark Gods, you may gain Corruption Points (see 182). Gathering too 
many of these can quickly lead to mutation (see page 183).

Psychology
If your character has any Psychology (see 
page 190) record it here. Psychologies include 
phobias, animosities and strong loyalties. Most 
starting characters do not begin with any 
Psychologies. 

Trappings, Encumbrance, 
and Wealth
Your Trappings (see page 37) are your 
belongings. These may include clothing, bags, 
candles, ropes, or bandages. As your character 
is limited in how much they can carry, you 
must also record each item’s Encumbrance 
(see page 293). Add up the total Encumbrance 
of your Armour, Weapons, and Trappings to 
see how much weight you are carrying. 

Your character’s Wealth is recorded in brass 
pennies, silver shillings, and, if you’re especially 
wealthy, gold crowns. Spend it wisely!

Wounds
Record your Wounds (see page 34) here. Your 
Wounds are derived from your Characteristics 
and Talents. As you are injured in Combat 
(see page 156) your Wounds will go down, 
while Healing (see page 181) will increase 
them again (though never beyond your 
maximum). As you gain Advances in your 
Characteristics and Talents, your Wounds may, 
in turn, increase. 

Spells and Prayers
If your character is in a religious or magical 
Career, you may have access to Spells (see page 
238) or Prayers (see page 217). These represent 
supernatural abilities, as your characters draws on 
the winds of magic, or calls on their favoured deity 
for assistance in times of need. 

Weapons
Record details about your Weapons (see page 293) 
here. As well as the type of Weapon, you will also 
record its Encumbrance (how heavy it is), how 
much Damage it inflicts, and, if it is a Ranged 
Weapon, at what Range it can be used.

class and careers

•

‘Well, I play a character with no class at all who would sell his 
grandmother for career advancement; you know, exactly the type of 
fellow frequently encountered in my line of work.’

– detlef sierck, playwright and actor

Your  Career  is  your  job  when  not  off  adventuring  (or  having 
adventures  done  to  you,  as  may  often  be  the  case).  It  describes 
your  training,  social  class,  and  your  future  prospects.  WFRP 
groups similar Careers into Classes.

clASSeS

A summary of each Class is found in Chapter 2: Character on 
page 30. Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups. 
They  also  impact  character  development,  provide  different 
starting Trappings during Character Creation (see page 37), and 
influence how you can change Career (see Changing Career on 
page 48). Some Classes have access to different Endeavours — 
activities you can take between adventures; for more on this, see 
Chapter 6: Between Adventures.

cAReeRS

The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in 
your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one 
for you. The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible, 
so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of 
your Character concept.

c l a s s   a n d   c a r e e r s

Career LeveLsEvery Career has four levels, each progressively better than the last. If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career, you can see the four levels are: 1. Apprentice Apothecary2. Apothecary3. Master Apothecary4. Apothecary-GeneralWhen choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at the first level of the career — so, if you were an Apothecary, you would start as an Apprentice Apothecary. advanCing Through Your CareerYour Character’s Career affects how they will grow through experience. Every Career offers three forms of Advances: Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances, and Talent Advances — each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP). You can also use XP to Change Career. Your Career Level determines what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you.Characteristic AdvancesEvery Career has an Advance Scheme governing its Characteristic Advances. The Advance Scheme shows your character’s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with h, 1 marked with  on a brass background, 1 marked with a  on silver, and the last marked  on gold.The three marked h are Characteristics you can advance in the first level of the Career. When you enter the second level of a career, the  Characteristic also becomes available. When you enter the third level, the  Characteristic also becomes available. And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the   Characteristic finally becomes available.The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table, and depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have already taken in that Characteristic.Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated Characteristic. So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances, and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be 31. The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the 0–5 range.Chapter 5: Rules explains how the Characteristics are used in the game, and Chapter 2: Character explains what each Characteristic is. There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become prohibitively expensive. Note: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill have the word ‘Skill’ in them, this is only a historical artefact — they are characteristics and are Advanced as such.CharaCteristiC and skill improvement Xp CostsAdvances XP Cost per AdvanceCharacteristicsSkills0 to 525106 to 10301511 to 15402016 to 20503021 to 25704026 to 30906031 to 351208036 to 4015011041 to 4519014046 to 5023018051 to 5528022056 to 6033027061 to 6539032066 to 7045038070+520440Skill AdvancesYou can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and lower. So, if you were an Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1), you could only access the Skills listed under Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1). But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary (level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1).The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table, and depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already taken in that Skill.Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level. Therefore, if you had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31, your Stealth would be 40. The first 5 Advances would cost 10 XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each.Note: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be marked in italics. This is the Skill you Test when Earning money (see page 51). The full rules for how to use your Skills can be found in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. Like Characteristic Advances, there is no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be purchased.III

NoN-Career advaNCesCharacters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and Skills not listed in their Careers. That’s fine, if the GM feels it’s appropriate, but it costs double. The GM might want you to find a teacher or otherwise play out this unusual education. Non-Career Characteristic and Skill Advances cost double the amount of XP listed in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table.Normally, non-Career Talents may not be purchased with XP, although Training and Unusual Learning Endeavours in Chapter 6: Between Adventures provide an opportunity to purchase non-Career Advances as if they were Career Advances, and give the possibility of learning non-Career Talents.Talent AdvancesTalents are only available when you are in the level of the Career that lists them. So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master Apothecary.Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already taken in that Talent.The rules for every Talent can be found in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents. The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP) it grants you access to the Talent’s special rules. If you purchase a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300 XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent description.Note: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times. Check the Talent listing for any limitations.Changing CareerWhen you have taken all the Advances you want in your current Career, it’s time to change Career. Changing Career means one of two things: 1) Moving to a different level within your current Career (from Apothecary to Master Apothecary); or 2) Moving to an entirely new Career (from Apothecary to Scholar).OPTiONS: CUSTOMiSE YOUr TrAPPiNGSThe Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only. Feel free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that fit your interpretation of your character’s Career and how it manifests. So, if you were using the Soldier Career to represent a grizzled Handgunner from reikland’s State Army, you may decide to tweak the required Trappings to include powder and shot. Trappings are how you are recognised as someone belonging to your career. if you want to go incognito, you might not want to have all your trappings with you. Similarly, if you are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the trappings of such means people might not take you seriously.In each case, you will have to first determine if you have completed your current Career level. If you have, changing Career costs 100 XP. If you have not, it costs 200 XP.Completing a CareerCompleting a Career represents mastering your current vocation and being ready to move on to something new. To complete a Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all your Career level’s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level’s available Skills. You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current Career level. Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement prior to entering your current Career count towards this..LevelAdvances15210315420Note: Just because you have completed a Career level does not mean you have to move to a new one. Moving Career is always entirely up to you. If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper forever, that’s completely fine.Changing to a New LevelIf you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP. So, if you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker c l a s s   a n d   c a r e e r s

(Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4).With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels. This is normally driven by in-game events. For example: A Scion (Noble level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career. Like normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not.Changing to a New CareerIf you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for 200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level. If you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class, this cost an extra 100 XP. Note: your GM may require in-game justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class.Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same Career level in any Career within your Class. So, if you completed Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching position in Altdorf University. This costs 100 XP. However, be aware there are obvious limitations here. Some Careers, such as Wizard, require the basics be learned before the more advanced lore can be understood and the Talents of earlier Career levels will not be open to you at a higher level.Lastly, between adventures, you can also change Career using the Change Career Endeavour (see page 196).TalenT and Career Change XP CosTs ImProvemenTImprovementXP Cost+1 Talent Advance100 XP + 100 XP per time the Talent is already takenLeave a Complete Career100 XPLeave an Incomplete Career200 XPEnter a different Class+100 XPalTernaTIve Changes In Careersometimes during play you are offered a job in the most unlikely circumstances. For example: a local Baron may employ you to be his honour guard (guard, Career level 3), or you may escape altdorf on the run from the city watch, now effectively an outlaw (outlaw, Career level 2). In such circumstances, the gm may offer a Career change that lies outside your normal Career Path. That’s not only fine, it’s recommended, as it’s always more fun to tie your Career choices into in-game events.StatuSOld World society is highly stratified — common folk are in little doubt as to their place in the society whilst the elite enjoy power and prestige that is brutally enforced and therefore largely unchallenged. Most people in between are acutely aware of their standing, and preoccupied with improving it. This is represented by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of different social classes.Tiers and sTandingStatus is expressed as a Tier — from lowest to highest: Brass, Silver, or Gold — and a Standing — which is a number, generally from 1–5, showing how respected the character is within their Tier. If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher Status. If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you are higher Status if you have a higher Standing.The Three TiersThe most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:The Gold Tier: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of the law; and the independently wealthy. To reach this position requires hard work, success, and not a little luck. All in the Gold tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the Silver and Brass tiers.The Silver Tier: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those following professions requiring skill and expertise. Tradesmen, craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the III

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services. These folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable. People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the Brass Tier.The Brass Tier: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest professions which often require no particular skills. The Brass Tier also contains many criminals, ne’er-do-wells, and those who don’t make any living at all. Determining StatuSYour Status is determined by your Career level. Beside the name of your Career level is your Status, marked as ‘Brass 3’, ‘Silver 1’, or similar. This is the Tier and Standing. Should you change Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet.Changing StatuSStatus changes for the following reasons:1. You change Career.2. You gain a Talent that modifies Status.3. The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game events.Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your character. If you have changed to a different Career Level, say from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject did you study? And how does your character now feel after graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances makes your character more rounded and believable.Beyond the Social normStatus provides a rough guide to how the folk of the old World behave when they fit in with acceptable norms. However, some characters will violate this, and that’s completely fine. If you wish to randomise how an NPC reacts to Social Status, roll 1d10 on the following table:1d10Result1-2Defies Status. The character defies conven-tion concerning Status and ignores its effects.3-8Standard Reactions. The character follows the Status rules as normal.9-10Extreme Views. The character holds extreme views. Modify all Tests influenced by Status by a further +/–10, as appropriate.the effeCtS of StatuSStatus influences a number of situations that impact your Character. Often these involve making Tests easier or more difficult (see page 153). The GM may expand or limit these influences as they wish.CharmStatus impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status c l a s s   a n d   c a r e e r s

finding it harder to secure influence. In most circumstances, those 
of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing 
those  with  a  lower  tier.  Similarly,  those  of  lower  Tier  suffer  a 
penalty of –10 to influence those of a higher Tier. The GM may 
also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the 
same Tier, but this is rarer.

If  the  target  of  the  Charm  attempt  is  atypical,  this  might  not 
work as usual however. An individual who ‘Defies Status’ would 
mean  no  modifiers  apply,  and  one  with ‘Extreme Views’  might 
mean that the opposite modifiers apply (–10 rather than +10, for 
example).

optIons: BeGGInG & status
Begging is often most effective when aimed at those who are 
just above you in the social order. 

For  example:  most  Beggars  are  Brass  tier  and  therefore 
benefit from a +10 bonus when begging from people who are 
silver tier, instead of suffering a –10 penalty.

Entertain
Status  does  not  normally  influence  Entertain  tests.  However,  a 
GM  ought  to  consider  that  some  entertainments  are  thought 
fitting  to  particular  venues.  A  peasant  playing  a  hurdy-gurdy 
is  not  likely  to  go  down  well  at  an  opera  house,  whilst  even  a 
mediocre  orchestra  is  likely  to  draw  a  significant  audience  if  it 
starts performing on the village green.

If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test, 
you gain a bonus of +10. If you are two tiers higher, the bonus 
increases to +20.

mainTaining sTaTUs
In  order  to  benefit  (or  suffer)  from  Status,  you  have  to  act  in 
accordance with your role in society.

It  may  be  that  you  wish  to  pass  incognito,  presenting  yourself 
anonymously. Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of 
Brass 3 if you do this.

Example: Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always 
buys the best trappings. He rides his lovingly groomed horse 
into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his 
presence to all. He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status. His 
brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly 
garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer. He is 
treated as having a Status of Brass 3.

Keeping Up Appearances
Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain 
their lifestyle. As explained in The Cost of Living (see page 289) 
there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier.

Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure 
they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1 
point of Standing per week. 

To  stop  this  decline,  the  character  must  resume  spending  the 
money  expected  of  them,  whereupon  they  regain  1  point  of 
Standing a week until they recover the lost points.

Should  Standing  reach  0,  your  tier  drops  by  one  and  your 
Standing is set to 5. If you are already at the lowest tier, then your 
Status sticks at Brass 0.

As  such  the  GM  might  like  to  consider  the  sort  of  audience 
a  performance  is  normally  aimed  at,  and  the  audience  that  is 
actually available, and apply suitable modifiers.

Intimidate
If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you 
typically gain a bonus of +10.

Example: Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East 
End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of 
Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer, 
and hostels in flop houses. Should another week pass and Pietr 
does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0, 
which immediately becomes Silver 5. Should this occur, Pietr’s 
father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame…

Gossip
Gossip  tends  to  be  stilted  between  people  of  different  classes. 
Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a 
penalty of –10.

Leadership
Status  plays  a  very  important  role  in  Leadership.  Indeed,  the 
State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble 
birth.

eaRning money wiTh sTaTUs
Your  Status  is  directly  linked  to  the  amount  of  money  you 
earn  while  working. The  higher  your  Status,  the  more  money 
you can earn as your good name attracts business. If the GM 
agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career 
assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it’s hard to 
be  a  Watchman  in  the  middle  of  a  wasteland). This  is  called 
Earning.

51

III

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

52

When Earning, make an Average (+20) Dramatic Test (see page 152) against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill marked in italics in the Career’s first level). If passed, you receive the money marked in the table below. If failed, you receive half the money. If an Astounding Failure (–6) is scored, you have a very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or some similar mishap). This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it’s more a representation of how much money you have left at the end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account.TierAmount Earned per StandingBrass2d10 Brass PenniesSilver1d10 Silver ShillingsGold1 Gold CrownNote: This is the same amount of coin earned with an Income Endeavour (see page 198).Example: Gunther the Coachman decides he’ll work for the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers research a library for things he frankly doesn’t understand, and secretly thinks may be heretical if he did. The GM agrees to let Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive (Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes. Given his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver. Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work shifts, and has little coin remaining…Gendered Career namesalthough some Careers have masculine or feminine names because of the limitations of language, all careers are intended for any gender; so, no matter how your character identifies, all careers are available.For example: anyone may serve any deity. although some Gods (such as Taal and Ulric, and rhya and shallya) are more likely to have servants who identify with the same gender as the God, other deities (such as Verena and sigmar), have an equal appeal to all. Career FormaTThe following is a breakdown of the information each Career presents.•	Name: The name of the Career.•	Limitations: a list of the different species typically using the Career.•	Summary: a one-sentence introduction to the Career.•	Description: a paragraph or two describing the career, and alternatives ways it may be used.•	Advance Scheme: The Career’s advance scheme.•	Career Path: The name, status, skills, Talents, and Trappings for each of the Career’s four levels. note: if a Talent or skill is marked ‘(any)’ it means you can choose one of the options for that Talent or skill when in that Career Level; so, Lore (any), could be Lore (Geography), Lore (Folklore), Lore (magick), or any other similar example. Likewise, if one is marked (Local), it means you can choose one of the options for the Talent or skill drawn from the local area; so, Lore (Local), could be Lore (altdorf), Lore (riverways), Lore (The Wasteland), or any other similar example.•	Quotations: a few in-game quotations about the Career.•	Adventuring: some hints and tips about how those in the Career might find themselves adventuring.c l a s s   a n d   c a r e e r s

APothecARy

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

Skilled in chemistry and concoctions, you create and sell medicine of 
all kinds.

Apothecaries  specialise  in  preparing  pharmaceutical  medication  — 
commonly pills, draughts, and ointments — for sale to patients and 
doktors  alike.  Their  workshops  are  filled  with  a  dazzling  array  of 
bubbling alembics, overflowing beakers, worn mortar and pestles, and 
other physic-making paraphernalia. Some Apothecaries supplement 
their income selling illicit substances — from stimulants for desperate 
students,  to  hallucinogenic  weirdroot  for  bored  nobles  or  shady 
commissions from even shadier groups. Supplying these is lucrative, 
but also dangerous. Rare ingredients are expensive, so Apothecaries 
frequently have cash flow problems, and journey the wilds to collect 
their  own  ingredients.  Many  take  temporary  employment  with 
expeditions, mercenaries, or the military for extra coin. 

‘Look for this sigil: white mortar, black pestle. Don’t ask for our order 
without it or you’ll be reported to the Watch. And lad, don’t ever short 
our Apothecary; you’ll spend the rest of your days wondering if the 
next drink will be your last.’

 – Kathe the Unseen, Assassin

‘Human chemistry? As shoddy as their architecture! And just as likely 
to kill you! I asked for tonic after a hard night’s drinking. Had the flux 
for a week!’ 

– Thorica Norrasdotr, Dwarf Merchant

Due to Physician Guild pressure, most towns ban Apothecaries from 
formally practicing medicine, but during play Apothecaries can easily 
fill the role of a healer. Indeed, they are versatile in this role because 
they  can  also  identify  dangerous  and  unusual  substances  the  party 
may encounter, and even turn some into useful medicine.

‘What will it do? Well, it’s supposed to pluck the chicken, Smallnose. 
Stand well back!’ 

– Wolfgang Kugelschrieber, Inventor

‘Master Engineer Volker von Meinkopt found inspiration watching 
students reloading at the Imperial Gunnery School. He had a revelation: 
more barrels = more shots = more lethality. He soon produced the first 
repeating handgun, ‘Von Meinkopt’s Whirling Cavalcade of Death’, 
and pistol, ‘Von Meinkopt’s Micro-mainspring of Multitudinous 
Precipitation of Pernicious Lead’. Not content to rest on those laurels, 
he then created the enormous nine-barrelled cannon, the Helblaster 
Volley Gun, which is utterly lethal to enemies and, all too often, its 
crew.’

 – ‘Great Engineers of the Empire’, Lady Theodora Holzenauer, 
Engineer and Journalist

Some Engineers are drawn to investigate ancient Dwarf Holds, most 
now  abandoned,  for  entombed  within  are  the  secrets  of  the  master 
builders  of  old. Those  who  dare  their  depths  may  find  millennia-old 
marvels,  many  of  which  are  repurposed  by  Goblins  and  Skaven  for 
their own nefarious purposes. Equally enticing are the stone sky bridges 
soaring above the Holds, some stretching for many miles, true wonders 
of bygone engineering that once connected thriving Dwarf settlements, 
forts, and farmlands.

You create machines and constructions both useful and bizarre, and 
often downright deadly.

Engineers  design  and  build  mechanical  devices  or  structures  such 
as bridges, canals, or fortifications. Most are educated, Dwarfs at the 
hide-bound  Dwarf  Engineers  Guild,  Humans  at  forward-thinking 
establishments  such  as  the  Imperial  Engineers’  School  at  Altdorf, 
though self-taught prodigies are not unknown. Human Engineers value 
innovation  and  discovery,  whereas  Dwarfs  favour  traditional,  tried-
and-tested  designs  passed  down  for  generations.  Mining  company 
engineers are well-paid; less so the State Army Engineers who maintain 
the  Imperial  war  machines  and  act  as  sappers  and  bridge-builders. 
Master  Engineers  often  find  themselves  leading  teams  on  ambitious 
construction projects. Chartered Engineers are the most trusted in the 
Empire, called upon to design, test, and build such prestigious Imperial 
Commissions  like  the  complex  Steam  Wheel  Locks,  which  have 
revolutionised the speed of travel in the canals of the Vorbergland.

‘Sharks! No, worse! Leeches! But not the good kind that suck out bad 
humours, oh no. They’re leeches that drain your coffers and leave you 
nothing to show for it.’

‘It is not what the lawyer says I may do that concerns me, but what 
is right by reason and justice. Such matters need then be the basis of 
our new law.’ 

– Lector Agatha von Böhrn, Supreme Law Lord of the Empire

Lawyers excel at getting people out of trouble, while adventurers excel 
at getting into it. They can use their knowledge of obscure local laws 
to avoid problems by suggesting unusual approaches to solve thorny 
dilemmas. After all, tying up a local thug in court is just as valuable, 
and arguably much safer, than tying one up in a basement.

lAWyeR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

You  navigate  treacherous  legal  systems,  defending  clients  and 
prosecuting the guilty.

Lawyers give legal counsel, interpret the law, and argue on behalf of 
their clients before the courts. They are often specialists in the laws of 
the province in which they practice, or in ecclesiastical law. Most are 
university educated and therefore rich and well-connected, although 
gifted  individuals  of  low  birth  are  sometimes  apprenticed.  Cult 
lawyers  learn  from  their  venerable  peers,  with  those  trained  by  the 
Cults of Verena and Sigmar especially well-regarded. Some Lawyers 
are  hired  as  mediators,  settling  informal  disputes  outside  costly 
courts,  a  practice  favoured  by  Halflings.  Others  work  for  criminal 
gangs,  exploiting  legal  loopholes  to  free  their  always-guilty  clients. 
At the top end of society, Barristers are the only lawyers allowed to 
address  higher  appeal  courts  in  the  city-states,  charging  exorbitant 
prices for their services.

You are devoted to the service of your deity, having sworn vows for a 
life of service.

Nuns are members of religious orders, normally cloistered within an 
abbey, convent, or monastery. Most rise before the sun for morning 
prayer  before  toiling  in  fields,  tending  to  the  sick,  or  preserving 
important manuscripts. Vows of pilgrimage cause some to travel the 
Empire,  while  others  take  oaths  to  serve  the  community,  moving 
amongst  the  people,  tending  to  their  spiritual  needs.    Devoted 
hermits and tenders to shrines are also thought of as ‘Nuns’ or ‘Monks’ 
by the folk of the Empire. Many Nuns learn valuable trades such as 
vintners,  brewers  or  calligraphers.  Abbesses  use  these  activities  to 
attract  donations  and  patronage  from  the  local  nobility.  Leaders  of 
particularly  large  or  martial  Orders  can  gather  significant  influence 
both within their own cult and with the ruling classes of a province.

When  a  religious  order  discovers  terrible  secrets  or  fragments  of 
prophecy,  its  leaders  may  feel  they  must  act,  sending  brothers  and 
sisters  abroad.  Abbeys  along  pilgrimage  routes  will  often  also  send 
their  members  abroad  to  guard  the  many  pilgrims  traversing  the 
lengthy holy roads across the Empire. And there are always itinerant 
Friars  wandering  the  world,  risking  adventure  with  every  new  land

‘Come to Neuber for all your limb removals! I’ll ’ave your arm off in

– Jana Palner, Part-time Surgeon

Physician’s  Guild  fees  are  notoriously  expensive,  which  can  cause 
newer  Physicians  without  steady  clientele  to  seek  alternate  sources 
of  income.  Some  Physicians  consistently  search  for  more  effective 
treatments and new medicines, which can take them far afield. Others 
like  to  expand  their  knowledge  of  anatomy  by  studying  grievous 
wounds first hand, and there are few better ways to do that than by 
travelling with adventurers.

PhySiciAn

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

With a strong stomach and steady hand, you practice the art of 
medicine, striving to save lives.

Physicians  study  patients’  symptoms  and  prescribe  remedies  and 
surgeries.  While  the  healing  arts  are  ancient,  many  deriving  from 
Elven practices, the formal science of medicine is relatively new and 
not-entirely-trusted.  Due  to  the  Empire’s  history  with  necromancy 
and the safe-guards imposed by the Cult of Morr, studying cadavers 
is forbidden, making learning of anatomy hard. Medicine’s reputation 
suffered further from swindlers selling ‘miracle cure-alls’ that do nothing 
or cause actual harm. Physicians learn their profession at a university 
or  while  apprenticed  to  a  Guild  Physician.  Most  cheap  surgery  is 
undertaken  by  back-street  physicians  known  as  barber-surgeons 
whose training is informal. Trained doctors with strong stomachs are 
in  demand  for  the  State  Armies. The  most  famed  Physicians  almost 
exclusively tend to wealthy merchants and the nobility.

You carry the word of your god, tending to the spiritual needs of the 
masses.

Priests  tend  to  congregations  of  the  faithful  throughout  the  Old 
World. While many are assigned to a specific temple, others choose 
a wandering life to reach worshippers who cannot, or will not, attend 
temple. They  are  expected  to  exemplify  the  beliefs  of  their  religion 
—  which  vary  greatly  depending  on  which  deity  they  serve.  High 
Priests are responsible for a temple and all its Cult and lay members. 
Alongside Lectors, they will often be called upon to advise the ruling 
classes,  with  many  active  in  local  politics.  Priests  have  many  duties 
connected  to  their  God,  such  as  Priests  of  Manann’s  responsibility 
to consecrate new ships, or a Shallyan’s duty to tend to the sick and 
wounded, so they touch on most aspects of life in the Empire. For

‘The Shallyan, just a girl she was, stroked my little Anton’s forehead and 
whispered, and the screaming stopped. He smiled at me for the first 
time in days. I will never forget it. Oh, aye, he died not long after, but 
not in pain. Not in pain.’

‘Listen, there is nothing to fear. Hexensnacht comes every year. We 
need only call on the Lord of Death to watch over us. So, come the

 – Father Wilhelm Abgott, Priest of Morr

Some temple-bound Priests seek distractions to justify sojourns away. 
Disturbing matters heard from their congregations can send them on a 
quest for answers. Some High Priests find their administrative duties so 
far removed from the life they envisaged when they joined the Cult that 
they take extended pilgrimages away from their temple.

ScholAR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

You dedicate your life to the pursuit and study of knowledge, wherever 
that may take you.

Scholars  generally  study  at  one  of  the  Old  World’s  learning 
institutions, foremost amongst them the university in Altdorf. Most 
specialise  in  one  or  two  subjects,  and  many  learn  just  enough  to 
provide a useful career, or give them something to talk about at dinner 
parties. Poorer Scholars act as scribes, reading and writing notes for 
others as most of the Empire’s citizens are illiterate. Others become 
tutors educating the wealthy.  

‘None of us thought much of her. Scrawny thing the Captain dragged 
out a library in Altdorf, name of Sosber. Kept to herself. Nose in a 
book. But when we finally faced the Corpse Render, when so-called 
warriors ran, she stood fast. Her quiet voice rang with steel as she 
called out where to strike. Not the heads as you’d think, no, but the 
body. Steel slew the beast that day, but knowledge made it possible.’ 
– Oskar Reisdorf, Mercenary

Poor  Scholars  who  cannot  or  will  not  tutor  often  need  funds  to 
continue their research. A few search the dark corners of the world 
for  lost  secrets  and  ancient  tomes.  Others  are  hired  to  accompany 
adventuring expeditions where their knowledge can be put to more 
practical use. 

The  most  gifted  Masters  are  invited  to  join  a  university,  with 
renowned  Professors  delivering  popular  lectures  to  hundreds  of 
Students. Dwarfs and High Elves are less likely to be employed in an 
Imperial institution, though they may tour the Empire in search of 
esoteric knowledge. 

Scholar is a useful Career, with access to rare Lore skills, a good way 
for the GM to share information with players. Played with common-
sense they can counter-balance rash and martially-inclined characters’ 
tendencies to solve every problem with a blade. Scholars can use their 
knowledge to solve puzzles or come up with unusual strategies and 
tactics.

WizARd

High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Feared and distrusted by the citizens of the Empire, you legally wield 
powerful and dangerous magic.

Wizards channel one of the eight ‘Winds of Magic’ only spellcasters 
perceive, to cast potent spells. To legally cast magic in the Empire, a 
Human  must  follow  the  Articles  of  Imperial  Magic  and  belong  to 
one  of  the  Eight  Colleges  of  Magic  in  Altdorf  —  each  dedicated 
to  a  specific  wind,  as  Wizards  can  only  safely  channel  one.  After 
graduation,  Apprentices  become  Wizards  and  serve  the  Empire. 
Wizards  carefully  study  and  practice  their  art,  which,  according  to 
the  Articles,  they  can  only  use  outside  their  colleges  in  defence  of 
their own life, or against the enemies of the Empire. Many Wizards 
are attached to the Empire State Army, and although they are treated 
with  cautious  suspicion,  none  can  deny  their  effectiveness  on  the 
battlefield.

‘I don’t care what promises they make, or what colleges they belong to, 
they are dangerous abominations. I am continuing to petition for their 
destruction in the name of Sigmar, for the good of us all.’ 

– Reikhardt Mair, Witch Hunter

Many Wizards leave the Colleges of Magic in debt for the cost of their 
tuition. These Wizards may be keen to find immediate employment, 
or seek out their fortune on land, at sea, or anywhere else they might 
be able to find relics, artefacts or lost tomes of magical lore. Journeying 
Wizards, eager to prove themselves, are actively encouraged to test their 
skills across the Empire by hunting down whatever dangers threaten 
the local populace. 

Wizards  are  excellent  characters  to  add  some  firepower  to  a  group, 
but  it  can  be  intimidating  for  new  players  to  have  to  learn  a  whole 
additional  set  of  rules  for  spells.  Because  of  this  the  GM  should  be 
aware that they might initially need some extra support to ensure that 
they are using these rules effectively and to the group’s best advantage. 
You’ll choose the colour of magic you study when you take the Arcane 
Magic Talent. For more on magic see Chapter 8: Magic.

AgitAtoR

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

Charismatic and articulate, you champion your cause in the face of 
establishment opposition. 

Agitators  lobby  for  political  causes  using  print,  protest,  and  public 
speaking. They  muster  the  down-trodden  populace’s  sympathy  and 
support but must be wary of drawing the attention of Sigmarites or 
Dwarfs  interested  in  maintaining  established  traditions.  The  most 
dangerous  Agitators  have  destabilised  the  rule  of  nobles,  towns, 
and  even  entire  provinces.  Pamphleteers  nail  signs  to  billboards,  or 
distribute them in market squares, though often those they seek to 
reach cannot read. 

Religious  Agitators  can  make  a  good  living  as  street  preachers, 
receiving donations from pious devotees and attracting flagellants and 
zealots  as  followers.  Agitators  who  survive  long  enough  to  become 
Demagogues are often supported by powerful, hidden allies pursuing 
change for their own motives.

‘ALTDORF FOR ALTDORFERS! MIDDENLANDERS OUT!’ 
– Pamphlet, Street of a Hundred Taverns, Altdorf

‘Mark my words, if you’re looking to root out the agents of the 
Spinner of Fate, follow the clamouring in the streets. They can’t resist 
it. They’ll surface, sooner or later.’ 

 – Adrian Hoven, Cleric-Captain, Knights of the Fiery Heart

Agitators often move around, in search of larger crowds or fleeing the 
authorities. They may become leaders of motley groups of the restless 
and disaffected, exhorting — or even extorting — them to fight for 
a greater cause.

Altdorf has a legendary reputation for deep fogs and riots. Perhaps 
this  happens  because  Altdorf  is  the  Imperial  Capital,  or  maybe  its 
because  the  Grey  College  draws  swathes  of  treacherous Ulgu,  the 
Grey Wind  of  Magic,  to  the  city. Whatever  the  case,  it  seems  that 
whenever the fog draws in from the Altdorf Flats, mobs rise in the 
streets, and woe betide any watchmen who try to silence their right 
to be heard.

ARtiSAn

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

A skilled craftsperson, you take pride in your work, creating products 
for sale and commission. 

Artisans  produce  goods,  ranging  from  everyday  necessities  sold  by 
Bakers and Chandlers, to weapons and riverboats crafted by Smiths 
and  Shipwrights. The  Empire’s  larger  towns  and  cities  have  guilds 
to  protect  local  Artisans  from  fraudsters,  as  an  Artisan’s  entire 
livelihood  can  be  jeopardised  by  unskilled  competitors  hawking 
cheap  low-quality  merchandise.  Guild  Artisans  observe  strict 
quality standards, with those failing to meet them blackballed and 
forbidden to trade locally.  

Artisans work at all levels of society not just producing goods, but 
also repairing them. They are employed by navies to maintain vessels, 
by armies to manage war machines and siegeworks, and by merchant 
houses of all sizes to transform raw materials into sellable goods.

 ‘Sorry, mistress, all the shoes are gone! I forgot to put the milk out last 
night. The Spite must have taken them.’ 

– Wiebke, Cobbler’s Apprentice and Thief

‘You must understand, my boy, that Wurtbad’s wine has a reputation. 
This bottle looks like it was blown through a Hochland long rifle. 
Simply unacceptable.’ 

– Frau Glasmeister, Glassblowers’ Guildmaster

Artisans  in  training  can  be  sent  to  practice  under  other  masters. 
The  constant  pressure  to  achieve  perfection  is  so  stifling  that  young 
Artisans sometimes take a break to pursue more liberating enterprises, 
sometimes supporting the army or navy.

Dwarf Guilds don’t usually admit Humans, and Dwarfs are traditionally 
allowed to practice their trade in Imperial cities without joining a local 
Guild. This  can  cause  conflict  as  the  Guilds  are  rarely  pleased  with 
skilled  competition.  Halflings  are  not  so  particular,  and  most  will 
happily join Human Guilds (if admitted) and allow Humans to join 
their Guilds. Elves do not have Artisan’s Guilds, and though they could 
join one it is unlikely they would lower themselves to do so.

beggAR

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

Street-smart, you make a living from the charity of others using 
persuasion and charm.

The countryside rumour that Altdorf ’s streets are lined with gold is a 
cruel taunt to its Beggars. They rely upon the generosity of strangers 
and scraps scavenged from the mud and detritus of city life, though 
posturing  dandies  will  happily  dispose  of  a  few  pfennigs  to  make 
them go away. The law affords them little protection and the watch 
has no sympathy for loiterers.

Paupers often land on the streets as orphans and have been in and out 
of Mercy Houses all their lives. Once the basic skills of scrounging 
and panhandling are learned, Beggars can advance their techniques 
using disguises and sympathy ploys. Other Paupers are not destitute 
but simply employed in some of the worst occupations, on the lowest 
rung of the social ladder, like Gong Farmers, Bone Pickers, and Rag 
and Bone Men. 

‘Please, frau, I beg humbly for enough coppers to buy bread tonight. 
Even a pfennig would do — Gutbäcker is selling day-olds.’

 – Elsie, Halfling Panhandler

‘I lost my leg in the Battle of Bögenwasser. Both hands were eaten by 
a Squig when Goblins ambushed our patrol near Bögenauer. All to 
protect the Reikland and our Emperor.’ 

– Klaas, Veteran Soldier

‘You can have Königplatz next week — I need you loud and dirty on 
Luitpoldstrasse today. For why? Best not ask, all you need to know is 
the Cutters want the Watch distracted. I make it my business not to 
offend the Cutters, and if you want a prosperous career you’ll follow 
my example.’ 

– ‘The Kaiser’, Altdorf Beggar-King

The only direction from rock-bottom is upward. Some Beggars will 
eagerly  leave  the  gutter  behind  for  adventuring  opportunities,  so 
long as they aren’t being exploited as battle-fodder. Those unable to 
afford a porter might hire a Beggar instead, and a Beggar’s savvy is 
useful when penniless and hungry. And, if it all goes wrong, it’s easy 
to return to the begging life.

Perceptive and suspicious, you probe deep into the heart of any crime, 
and find answers.

Most  Investigators  pursue  cases  involving  stolen  property,  missing 
persons,  or  murders,  although  some  research  stories  for  the 
emerging  newssheets,  or  even  blackmail  crime  suspects  for  ‘hush 
money’.  Investigative  techniques  include  footprint  tracking,  cross-
examination,  deductive  reasoning  and  —  if  necessary  —  breaking 
and entry. Where secular investigators operate on the edge of the law 
or for an institution like the watch of a Merchant House, religious 
investigators  —  most  commonly  serving  Sigmar  and  Verena  —  
follow stricter ethical codes. 

‘I regret to inform you that your husband is buried in Frau Kohl’s 
vegetable garden, beneath the turnips. That will be 6 shillings and 4 
pence, please.’ 

– Hemlock Surelight, Elven Sleuth

‘We can deduce from this splintered door the thief exited with 
assistance from a very large creature. But said creature couldn’t 
have descended the narrow stairwell. This leaves only two possible 
conclusions. Either it materialised from thin air, or else our thief is a 
shape-changer...’ 

– Zavant Konniger, ‘Sage-Detective’ 

‘As I am sure you know, I am the world’s greatest detective.  You ’ave 
’eard of Alphonse, no?’ 
– Alphonse Hercules de Gascoigne, Diminutive Bretonnian Detective

Some  experienced  Investigators  cultivate  matter-of-fact  airs  of 
sophistication to improve their credibility. While Master Investigators 
often sell themselves as ‘observation specialists’ possessing skills they 
claim cannot be learned. Considerable self-promotion is required to 
become  one  of  the  famous  Detectives  who  receive  job  offers  from 
across the Old World. 

Investigators are sometimes hired to solve mysteries far too dangerous 
to tackle alone, which can be the informal creation of an adventuring 
party. Of course, the very nature of mysteries can result in each solved 
case leading to yet another mystery. Investigators may therefore enjoy 
steady employment, provided they’re able to identify willing customers 
for every new mystery they uncover.

Shrewd and numerate, you buy low to sell high, making more money 
than most will ever see.

Most  Merchants  trade  in  simple  goods  such  as  alcohol,  textiles, 
woodcraft, and pottery. For the ambitious, rare exotic goods such as 
Dwarf  gromril  or  Eastern  spices  command  higher  profits,  but  risk 
longer transport routes and require strong foreign contacts. Merchants 
cannot sell in most towns without approval from (and payments to) a 
Merchants’ Guild, powerful institutions rivalling the noble courts in 
political influence. Local commerce is managed by Traders who ship 
goods between backwater villages and nearby towns. 

Traders  can  join  guilds  by  apprenticing  under  Master  Merchants 
as  junior  business  partners.  Powerful  Merchant  Princes  owning 
warehouses and sales offices in multiple cities enjoy the same status as 
minor nobles. In addition to trading, some Merchants also branch out 
into banking, moneylending, and investing.

‘If Nuln wants trade wars, so be it, I’ll see their river blockaded and 
raise taxes on guns. After all, the Emperor owes me a few favours...’ 
– Leo van Haagen, Marienburg Merchant Prince

‘How did I become a millionaire? Well, when I was a girl with only a 
pfennig to my name, I went to the local farmer and bought an apple. 
Then I walked to the market and sold the apple for two pfennigs. 
The next day I bought two apples from the farmer and walked to the 
market again and sold the apples for four pfennigs. And so it went on, 
every day; I walked to the farm bought some apples, and then walked 
to the market to sell them at a profit. And by the time I was twenty-
five years old, my grandfather died and left me a million crowns.’ 

– Johanna Sainzburg, Fresh Fruit Magnate

Merchants  share  a  certain  kinship  with  adventurers,  often  hiring 
them over professional caravan guards. Adventurers are adaptable and 
enterprising by nature, making them ideal candidates for partnership 
in  a  trading  company,  bringing  Merchants  into  contact  with  all 
manner of colourful characters.

‘See there by the midden-heap, Otmar? There’s a big one! Make sure it’s 
dead before you pick it up. It’ll bite yer hand with its poisonous teeth.’ 
– Annaliese Rattenfänger, Sewer Jack

‘Sorry, mate. The rest of the guild deal with the rats. Me and me mates 
deal with the bigger ones in the sewers. Tide of them down there, 
there is...’

– Mårten Stormdal, Ubersreik Exterminator

Rat Catchers move to new towns when the rats become ‘too big’ or ‘too 
clever’,  or  when  competition  becomes  fierce.  When  journeying,  they 
may befriend those who welcome help from a streetwise slinger, and 
Rat Catchers are willing to venture into places normal people won’t.

If you want to play a character who may be aware of the ‘too big’ and 
‘too  clever’  Skaven  (see  page  336),  Rat  Catcher  is  for  you.  However, 
the  Skaven  frequently  assassinate  any  who  spread  rumours  of  their 
existence. Because of this, wise Ratcatchers are unlikely to admit what 
they  know,  some  even  using  their  professional  opinion  to  actively 
discredit ‘tall tales’ of ‘rat men’.

You spare civilisation from being overrun by vermin with help from 
your trusty, canine companion.

Rat  Catchers  patrol  every  town  and  city,  and  for  good  reason. The 
Empire’s  streets  are  clogged  with  food  scraps  and  foulness,  perfect 
breeding  grounds  for  vermin.  Rat  Catchers  earn  their  crusts  by 
killing these rats, clearing their nests from cellars, and by delving the 
Empire’s hopelessly infested sewer systems… provided they’re brave 
enough to face the other things down there. When apprenticed, Rat 
Catchers usually adopt a stray puppy that they train for ratting. The 
toughest Rat Catchers are hired by towns as Sewer Jacks to hunt giant 
rats and other subterranean nasties. On rare occasions, entire towns 
are overrun and later reclaimed with the aid of Exterminators.

‘I’m afraid you’ll have to remove your backpacks in this shop and 
leave polearms at the door. The owner deducts broken ceramics from 
me wage.’

 – Frida, Part-time Shopkeeper

Townsmen are part of a growing class of citizen with both time and 
money at their disposal. Many take one or two days off a week and 
can easily fit in a life of adventure between shifts or after closing time. 
Some may wish to go even further afield, and if the Townsman has 
some  money  put  aside,  it  should  be  simple  to  negotiate  some  time 
off with an employer. It’s very common for citizens of the Empire to 
go on pilgrimages for weeks or months at a time. Skilled workers are 
always in demand, and there will likely be a role waiting when they 
come home.  

toWnSmAn

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

Ambitious and socially mobile, you are the hardworking glue that 
holds urban society together. 

Townsmen  meet  these  thriving  centres  of  trade  and  commerce’s 
demand  for  workers.  They  fill  various  roles  for  private  artisans  or 
municipal councils: Bankers, Clerks, Hawkers, Innkeepers, Newspaper 
Vendors,  Ostlers,  Shopkeepers,  Toll-keepers,  Washers,  and  many 
more. Pay rates vary; some can haggle for extra commission, whereas 
civil employees such as lamplighters and toll-keepers are paid fixed 
salaries.  There  is  little  opportunity  for  promotion,  but  those  with 
determination,  savvy,  and  luck  might  eventually  own  property  or  a

The most successful Townsmen often join local councils overseeing 
civic matters, with Burgomeisters — the most important municipal 
leaders — often enjoying the same social status as Merchant Princes 
and Guildmasters.

WAtchmAn

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

You maintain the peace and keep the rabble in line so your town 
doesn’t descend into anarchy.

Watchmen  are  employed  by  local  authorities  to  patrol  streets 
throughout  the  Empire.  Most  are  little  more  than  well-meaning 
keepers  of  the  peace,  and  few  know  the  laws  they’re  supposed  to 
enforce.  Corruption  is  rampant,  and  many Watchmen  enlist  purely 
for the authority to hurt people or to support local criminal gangs. 
Some can earn triple their wages by turning a blind eye. 

Only  a  few  towns  and  cities  have  professional  Watchmen  paid  to 
understand  and  uphold  the  law;  instead,  the  Emperor’s  Peace  is 
normally maintained by the local State Army, who man walls, guard 
gates,  and  patrol  the  streets  according  to  the  instructions  of  their 
superiors. 

‘So I go up to Middenheim, Ulric’s own country, and what did I find? 
I swear more than half of their City Watch are women! I would have 
stayed up there for the rest of my career if I could’ve.’ 

– Jana Tennisohn, Chief Inspektor (retired), Nuln City Watch 

‘Sorry, sir, I’ve got a Halfling killer, a Weirdroot smuggling ring, a gang 
war, and a noble threatening to have me arrested by my own Station. 
Your missing cat will have to wait until tomorrow.’ 

– Sergeant Harri Makkenpieser, Altdorf City Watch

Not every Watchman is crooked, but those with morals are soon jaded 
by  the  corruption  inherent  in  the  system.  By  joining  adventuring 
parties, principled Watchmen can champion justice on their own terms. 
Experience  of  the  street  makes Watchmen  effective  combatants  in  a 
small party, and their presence can help legitimise a wandering band 
of ne’er-do-wells.

AdviSoR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Wise and well-informed, you provide advice and guidance so your 
employer prospers.

Advisors  provide  counsel  to  those  they  serve.  Well-versed  in  the 
political  and  social  conditions  of  their  employer’s  domain,  they  are 
privy to confidential and sensitive information. While many Advisors 
are born into their positions, others actively seek noble patronage as 
a path to wealth and power. Some young royals pick their university 
or  childhood  friends  as  their  first  Aide,  trusting  them  to  say  what 
no-one else will. 

Long  years  at  court  or  in  service  to  a  lesser  noble  pave  the  way  to 
the loftier heights of their careers. Many Advisors do not serve the 
nobility at all, instead lending their extensive capabilities to criminals, 
warlords, merchants, cults, or guilds.

‘Sigmar votes with Reikland for three. The dead Emperor, Mootland, 
and Reikland will vote the same way, taking Reikland to six. As you 
know, you need seven votes to become emperor. Given Ar’Ulric 
always votes for Middenheim, it’s highly unlikely the Imperial seat 
will return to Nuln while the House of Third Wilhelm flourishes. 
Best hope for a daughter, your Grace. A marriageable one.’

 – Krammond, Advisor to the Elector Count of Nuln, 2475 IC 

If there is something peculiar or dangerous happening within their 
employer’s domain, then an Advisor is well-placed to investigate. At 
the higher levels of the career, a Counsellor or Chancellor will have 
their own trusted staff they can rely on to look after matters if they 
take a short leave of absence. Advisors can approach different classes 
of people, including the most difficult to access, and they are already 
in a position where they are expected to ask questions on behalf of 
their employer.

‘Please remain still, my lord. It is rather difficult to capture the majesty 
of your countenance if you continue to scratch yourself so. Perfect! Now 
hold that pose for just a few seconds more if you please. And there 
you’ve gone and done it again. Might I suggest you pay a visit to the 
apothecary? He may have several effective remedies for lice, especially if 
you find your incessant squirming as bothersome as I do...’ 

– Gottlieb Toman, Painter, prior to his execution

Attracting suitable patrons is not always a simple matter, so Artists of 
all stripes find themselves traveling abroad in search of one. Even those 
who have the means to support themselves take to the road in search 
of new sights to paint, sculpt, or inspire them. Holy frescos and reliefs 
dedicated  to  the  gods  are  often  commissioned  in  faraway  temples, 
churches, and abbeys. 

ARtiSt

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

You possess an artistic gift, one that transcends daily life and uplifts 
the souls of others.

Artists use their talents — for painting, sculpting, writing and similar 
— to create works of fine art. Often their careers begin as Apprentices 
to experienced Master Artists, though some are simply prodigies. The 
best  can  attract  a  patron,  and  some  end  up  teaching,  forming  their 
own schools of art and attracting the wealthiest of benefactors to their 
fashionable salons.  

Sadly, most Artists spend their lives in a vain attempt to prove their 
value  to  a  society  that  rarely  appreciates  them.  Some  make  ends 
meet  through  different  means:  satirising  nobles  and  politicians  in 
cartoons  for  the  Altdorf  broadsheets,  sketching  suspects  for  watch 
captains, writing social commentary, or even forging the work of more 
renowned artists.

‘First blood, ye fool! First blood! And here ye’ve gone ’n run ’im 
through!’ 

- Ortolf Ehardt, Burgher

‘In my defence, sir, he was the first to do any sort of bleeding.’ 

- Rosabel Viernau, Duellist

‘Always make sure you have Doktor Schuller on site. Deniability? 
Good question. Pay her in advance, treat her with civility, and she’ll 
turn around. Then she sees nothing until the duel is over, one way or 
another.’ 

- Blademaster Aleksandr Amblestadt’s advice to his students.  

Both inexperienced and esteemed Duellists alike travel the Empire 
in search of opponents with which to bolster their reputations. For 
others,  the  hunt  for  a  veteran  instructor  drives  them  to  explore 
the  furthest  flung  of  the  Old  World’s  locales.  Masters  of  foreign 
techniques are also sought by Duellists who wish to add unique styles 
of fighting to their repertoires. As skilled combatants, Duellists often 
augment their livelihood with mercenary work, even acting as guards 
for  caravans  and  riverboats  in  a  pinch.  Although  Dwarfs  have  no 
interest in fencing with flimsy swords and the frippery of the duelling 
scene,  they  have  long  traditions  of  using  combat  to  resolve  bitter 
disputes, and will travel far to enhance their skills. 

duelliSt

Dwarf, High Elf, Human

Your blade is an instrument of justice, bound by long tradition and 
employed with deadly precision.

Duellists  fight  on  behalf  of  others  —  settling  matters  of  honour 
between organisations or individuals — or as surrogates for the law, 
representing the accused or the accuser in trials by combat. For some 
Duellists  the  act  of  fighting  is  reward  enough  for  the  considerable 
risks  they  face.  Training  is  dangerous,  leaving  some  apprentices 
crippled or scarred for life. Those who live long enough to learn from 
their mistakes can aspire to the fame of a Blademaster, teaching their 
techniques to eager students. Judicial Champions duel on behalf of 
governments  and  nobles,  and  their  blades  can  determine  the  fates 
of  nations.  Some  modern  Duellists,  especially  hot-headed  Altdorf 
students,  favour  pistols. This  is  regarded  by  the  older  generation  as 
dishonourable and foolhardy.

‘Watch that one. She’s got a tongue like a snake and nary a scruple. Still,

‘ My advice to his Imperial Majesty to ensure we maintain our vital 
trade link with Karak Ziflin: grow a beard and keep your promises.’
 – Letter to the High Lord of the Chair, from Ambassador Willemijna 
von Kotzdam

Envoys travel a great deal, meeting countless individuals from all walks 
of life, cultivating contacts across the Old World. They are sometimes 
expected to get their hands dirty to ensure their master’s wishes are 
fulfilled. If failure doesn’t lead to their immediate death, they might 
find themselves on the run from their own employers.

envoy

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

An articulate emissary, you travel far and wide, negotiating favourable 
pacts and treaties.

Experts  in  negotiation  and  social  interaction,  Envoys  act  as  agents 
serving the interests of the Empire, a regional estate, a foreign entity, 
or a merchant house. Intrigue abounds in courtly circles, and such a 
career choice is a risky proposition that only grows more perilous at 
the highest levels of government. Even when granted some manner of 
immunity against foreign laws or customs, Ambassadors must tread 
carefully. 

Envoys must first prove their abilities in a lesser capacity as a Herald, 
assisting Diplomats in hammering out the tedious minutiae of deals, 
or representing merchants, guilds, or cults, building their reputations 
with  each  pact  they  establish.  Some  Envoys  find  employ  with 
Mercenary Companies; the best of these can secure a profit for their 
employers without shedding a drop of blood.

noble

Dwarf, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

As the scion of a noble bloodline, you stand proudly from the 
common rabble.

The  blood  of  highborn  ancestors  courses  through  the  veins  of  the 
nobility, granting Nobles the power to rule, make laws, and dispense 
justice. Nobles often inherit vast wealth and holdings, although only 
those with a direct line of succession can expect to wield any genuine 
power.  Many  spend  their  lives  consolidating  this  wealth  and  power 
through  business,  politics,  and  conquest.  Those  without  substantial 
inheritance must make their own way in the world, joining the State 
Army or navy as a commissioned officer, or commit to service of one 
of the gods. It is common to find Nobles working for more powerful 
noble houses, such as sending their daughters to serve as hand maidens 
to royalty.

‘Everyone thinks that Nobles have it easy, but it’s a treacherous life 
and you’re always standing in someone’s way. I’d rather take my 
chances out here with you lot than risk assassins back home. Give me 
a herd of Beastmen any day.’ 

– ‘Lugner’ Rodziner, Tenth of his Line

Many Nobles serve their families abroad in the hopes they can advance 
their station and earn acclaim amongst their peers. Others, bored by 
pampered living, search for excitement as adventurers and would-be 
heroes. Scions with few prospects sometimes seek their fortunes far 
from  courtly  intrigue  and  betrayal,  taking  up  other  occupations  to 
expand their options. 

The GM should consider carefully whether to allow players to choose 
the Noble career. It comes with a lot of trappings and temporal power, 
especially at the higher levels of the career.

SeRvAnt

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

You serve the great and the good, performing tasks in support of your 
employer.

Most  who  serve  the  nobility  come  from  peasant  stock,  grateful  to 
escape the beleaguered masses tending the fields. Servants are taught 
comportment  along  with  the  skills  necessary  to  cook,  clean,  buttle, 
and groom on behalf of their betters. They are provided with room, 
board, and a wage, but the quality of a Servant’s life depends on how 
well  treated  they  are.  Some  Servants  dress  their  employer,  cook  or 
serve meals, manage stores of wine and other consumables, or tend 
to the grounds. 

Experienced Servants can aspire to the role of personal Attendant, or 
even Steward, managing the domestic affairs of their employer and 
overseeing  other  Servants.  Those  directly  serving  royalty  are  often 
drawn from noble stock rather than the peasantry.

‘Only a fool mistreats those entrusted to cook food and pour wine. 
Believe me, there’s no end of damage a spiteful servant can wreak upon 
the unwise.’ 

– Baron Gerber Jochutzmann

‘Why she insists on takin’ that blasted cat with her is beyond me. 
Between her wardrobes, her travelling library, and her damned butterfly 
collection, I’m at my wit’s end! And when it gets lost — oh, it will, 
believe me — she’ll expect me to find her a new one. Sigmar! Where 
does one find a leopard kitten in Ubersreik?’ 

– Reynald, Lady Kirstin Gottlieb’s Porter

A Servant may be required to accompany their employer, travelling from 
winter to summer domains, or visiting the great cities. This can provide 
opportunities for adventures around the Empire. Bored heirs, closeted 
by over-protective parents, might treat their young Servants more like 
friends,  providing  them  with  encouragement  and  funds  to  seek  out 
adventures,  living  vicariously  through  them  when  they  report  back 
with tales of derring-do. Favoured Servants are, on occasion, entrusted 
with duties that take them beyond their familiar surroundings, or even 
loaned to other family members or peers.

SPy

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

You are the eyes and ears of another, exposing secrets and spreading 
lies.

Spies  are  brave  (or  foolhardy)  individuals  who  secretly  gather 
information for their clients. A well-placed Spy is an asset to anyone 
desiring  knowledge  of  an  opponent’s  activities.    Many  take  months, 
even  years,  cultivating  an  unremarkable  identity  with  ties  to  one  or 
more groups or individuals. Their actions are risky. If caught, Spies are 
rarely executed quickly and often tortured at length.  Many Informers 
are forced into spying via blackmail or other threats. A skilled Spy will 
earn well, but extrication from such activities can be more perilous than 
the activities themselves. Given Spies avoid undue attention, they aren’t 
typically  known  by  their  reputations  unless  those  reputations  are  as 
anonymous as they are.

‘Treason? That’s it? For the love of... why didn’t I qualify for high 
treason? I’ve done plenty of other terrible things. Should I list them 
off for you? What’s that? It’s not personal? Well, it is now, you prig-
powdered gaff’

– Sieben Dietmund, Accused of Treason and Contempt

Spies are found throughout the Old World and in service to many 
prominent organisations. During their investigations, Spies are easily 
embroiled in plots both sinister and benign. They are often forced to 
flee when their identities or allegiances are exposed. These individuals 
use  their  abilities  to  disguise  their  true  nature  and  avoid  capture. 
Joining a group of unwitting heroes under false pretences as part of an 
escape attempt has led more than one Spy to an adventuring career.

WARden

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

You oversee another’s territory, ensuring it is properly maintained and, 
if necessary, protected.

Wardens see to the care and stewardship of their employer’s holdings. 
Failure to improve — or, at the very least, maintain — an employer’s 
lands  or  provisions  is  often  met  with  disfavour.  In  some  instances, 
multiple  wardens  work  together  to  keep  their  employer’s  estate  in 
correct order. 

A Warden’s oversight can cover a variety of duties: ensuring the upkeep 
of  a  grand  estate,  overseeing  a  lord’s  hunting  grounds,  or  caring  for 
a  rarely-visited  holidaying  home.  Wardens  might  keep  watch  over 
forested or agricultural lands, or see to the maintenance of lakes, rivers, 
or ponds. Those in the employ of the richest and most powerful can rise 
to immensely powerful positions themselves. 

‘Yes, m’lord, the duke has been a-bed this last decade. And, yes, m’lord, 
I am running his estate. No, m’lord, I don’t see that changing any time 
soon. After all, in Penzkirchen, my word is now law… Arrest him!’ 

– W. Edvart Kurtz, Governor of Penzkirchen

Wardens  rarely  travel  unless  their  duties  call  for  it. That  said,  even 
those  assigned  to  oversee  an  estate’s  lands  or  hunting  grounds 
must make regular patrols to assess the property’s condition and to 
discourage poachers. When between jobs, Wardens often find work as 
guides or hunters, and such activities can lead to much excitement or 
terror. Wardens with a grudge against former masters might even be 
inclined to provide enemies with confidential information regarding 
their old estates.

are  respected  and  upstanding,  attending  throng  at  the  temple  of 
Sigmar every week. Others are bullies, happy to enforce their lord’s 
rights over property and possessions with threats and violence. Long-
serving bailiffs often become trusted servants of the local noble family 
and enjoy considerable perks. Reeves have a broader reach and greater 
responsibility. They keep order and maintain the borders of the lord’s 
lands, resolving disputes with neighbouring estates. 

Some  magistrates  are  lay-members  of  the  cult  of  Verena,  seeking 
guidance and wisdom from blind Justice on any difficult cases they 
judge. However, most provincial magistrates simply find themselves 
arbitrating  a  series  of  petty  disputes  over  livestock  and  farmland 
borders.

 ‘Aye, it’s been a poor harvest, but dues are dues. I’ll take half now and 
half on Marktag. How’s that? It’s the best I can offer, can’t say fairer 
than that.’ 

– Lena Sauer, Bailiff

‘I’ll go up and have a look at the grazing land in question myself. 
Until then, I want no trouble from any of your boisterous offspring, 
do I make myself clear, Bauer, Meier? And you will pay equal shares 
for the damage to the inn, or you will forfeit any claim you might, or 
might not have, on the land.’ 

– Lorenz Schulte, Reeve of Elster Vale

Most  Bailiffs  have  a  degree  of  autonomy,  granting  them  ample 
opportunity to turn their attention to private matters, or to hire others 
to do so on their behalf. As many also have broad authority in the 
areas  they  influence,  they  are  frequently  sent  by  their  employers  to 
resolve problems, which can often lead to unexpected places.

hedge Witch

Human

Wise and secretive, you guide your community using ancient magic 
handed down for generations.

Witch Hunters use the term ‘Hedge Witch’ for any illegal spellcaster, 
but  this  was  not  always  so.  Once  Hedge  Witches  were  respected 
members  of  rural  communities,  practising  magics  older  than  the 
forests. But decades of persecution since the founding of the Colleges 
of Magic have left the few surviving Hedge Witches disparate and 
broken. They  hide  in  the  quietest  corners  of  the  Old  World,  their 
smoky  huts  and  creaking  hovels  standing  astride  the  boundary 
between civilisation and the trackless wilds.  Most Hedge Witches are 
solitary to protect themselves from prying strangers, but their talents 
are often known to locals. Their knowledge of warding evil is usually 
secret,  but  their  herbalism,  midwifery,  and  healing  arts  are  quickly 
sought in times of need.

 ‘We tell the folk that the offering o’ fish is for Grandfather Reik, ‘cause 
it makes them feel safer than having to explain the river is home to an 
‘ungry spirit. It keeps the spirit safe, too.’

 – Alt Zaunreiter, Hedgewise

A  Hedge  Witch  is  often  the  first  to  notice  supernatural  foul  play. 
The  subsequent  investigations  often  lead  to  all  sorts  of  dangers  and 
adventure. When Witch Hunters come to town, Hedge Witches often 
take a leave of absence, lying low or travelling elsewhere until danger 
is passed.

The Hedgefolk are known by many names across the Empire, but have 
one thing in common: the goal of preserving their ancient traditions 
from destruction. Hedge Witches have little love for the Colleges of 
Magic,  knowing  any  child  taken  by  them  will  likely  never  return  to 
serve  their  community,  instead  pressed  into  service  in  some  far-off 
war. Whenever possible they hide children they consider ‘blessed’ from 
passing wizards, although occasionally one will be sent to the Colleges 
— as a sacrifice or a spy, who can say?

Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Skilled botanists who use Rhya’s bounty to create cures for many 
ailments.

‘This is beyond my skill to heal. The wound’s been infected and it’s 
tainting his blood; he needs a doctor, or Shallya’s aid. I can give you 
something to make sure he’s comfortable on the journey to town. And 
something for you, too, to calm your nerves.’ 

– Kurtis Schwarz, Herbalist

Medicines from apothecaries are expensive and rarely available in the 
Reikland’s hinterlands, so peasants rely on the healing power of plants 
gathered, doctored, and administered by  Herbalists. Most  Herbalists’ 
lore is verbally passed down from master to apprentice, so names for 
illnesses  and  treatments  often  vary  from  village  to  village. The  most 
experienced Herbwises are sent for in cases of mysterious or stubborn 
sicknesses. Herbalists dedicate time to visiting the sick, diagnosing their 
ailments and searching for herbs to treat them with. Some Herbalists 
ply a darker trade, sought out by those who can pay a high price for 
the  illicit  substances  they  offer.  Although  an  untrue  stereotype,  it’s  a 
standing joke in the trade that Halfling Herbalists are only interested 
in pipeweed and wyrdroot.

With knowledge of poultices and potions, Herbalists can easily find 
a place with  a  band of  travellers or  mercenaries. When  particularly 
virulent  diseases  take  hold,  Herbwises  often  send  their  apprentices 
to  far  off  places  in  search  of  rarer  herbs,  and  some  find  themselves 
in all manner of unexpected trouble. The Wood Elves’ knowledge of 
plants and herbs is legendary. In the Grey Mountains it is said that 
The Goddess Shallya wandered Athel Loren to learn their lore when 
Ranald was dying of an affliction she could not cure. High Elves who 
study the art of herbalism follow Lileath the Maiden’s teachings, and 
it’s rumoured there is an ancient elven library in Marienburg which 
records the medicinal use of every plant in the Old World, although 
no Human has yet been granted access.

hunteR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Tough, independent killers who make a living off the fur and flesh of 
wild creatures.

‘Taal’s  Bounty’  is  a  common  greeting  in  Hochland,  where  locals 
proclaim a proud hunting heritage that goes back to the time of Sigmar. 
Most in the Empire hunt, either as a hobby, a profession, or a necessity, 
and many Hunters turn to poaching when times are lean. 

Particularly skilled Hunters might be engaged as a noble’s Huntsmaster, 
granting access to fine weapons, horses, and falcons. Elves and Dwarfs 
have little care for the boundaries of men and will occasionally venture 
deep into Human territory tracking a challenging prize. Stories of the 
Wood Elves’ Wild Hunt petrify children of the Grey Mountains, and 
not without cause, for if any intruder strays too close to Elven lands, 
then the hunters quickly become the hunted.

‘My lord, those tracks… we’re not following a stag. There are Turnskins 
in these woods.’ 

– Gundred Maynir, Huntsmaster

‘Are you trying to tell me hunting’s not a sport because both sides 
don’t know they’re playing? Might I suggest you’d been hunting the 
wrong game.’ 

– Graf Bernard Leutze von Holthausen

A  common  punishment  for  hunter  caught  poaching  is  to  lose  two 
fingers. Faced with being unable to draw a bow, many will cut and run 
before the punishment can be administered, preferring to take a chance 
in the forests.  Around the fertile villages of the Suden Vorbergland, 
Hunters  are  losing  ground  to  farmers  as  the  trees  are  cut  back  and 
nobles  reserve  what  hunting  is  left  for  sport.   The  Imperial  Army  is 
always on the lookout for reliable, local hunters to support their army 
as they march, acting as support archers or scouts. A life of adventure 
awaits any Hunter willing to take the Emperor’s Shilling.

mineR

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

A hewer of stone, you pursue back-breaking work in the darkest 
depths of the world.

Many  prospectors  are  tempted  by  stories  of  gold  in  the  Skaag 
Hills,  but  real  mining  is  hard  work  down  dark,  dangerous  tunnels. 
Adept at constructing supports and assessing mineral ores for their 
value, Miners are alert to unexpected dangers from explosive gas to 
tunnelling Greenskins, and are notoriously tough, both physically and 
mentally. Prospectors usually work on commission, with a license to 
prospect in return for sharing finds with the local lord. Some noble 
houses’ fortunes are built on the rich mines in their lands, and often 
Miners in these pits will be criminals or debtors pressed into service. 
Quarrymen hewing open-face stone ostensibly have a safer job than 
those underground, but accidents are common and Beastman attack 
from the forest is an ever-present danger. 

 ‘After your supplies from the store are deducted, and your load of 
sixteen tons added, you made…let me see… no, you actually owe us 
two for today. Another day older and deeper in debt, boy.’ 

– Frederika, Victualler of the Delfgruber Minehead.

Many independent Miners find themselves thrust into peril when set 
upon by Goblins or other subterranean horrors. Some find the rewards 
of this life more lucrative, if not less dangerous, than slaving away for 
a  mine  owner  for  a  pittance.  Prospectors  have  many  opportunities 
for adventure and can easily pull together a band of like-minded folk 
eager for riches and glory.

To  Dwarfs,  mining  is  not  an  occupation  limited  to  commoners. 
Rather,  they  are  considered  artisans  of  great  skill  and  are  well-
respected  amongst  the  Dawi.  Possessed  of  a  keen  sense  for  stone, 
Dwarfs are drawn to valuable seams and seemingly have a sixth-sense 
for when to shore up passages. Some Dwarf clans hold such pride in 
their mining ability that they march to war armed with picks rather 
than axes.

myStic

Human, Wood Elf

You have a talent for divining the future, or for convincing others you 
can…

Searching for meaning in a dangerous world, people turn to Mystics 
for  a  glimpse  of  their  future.  Wandering  caravans  of  Strigany  are  a 
common sight in Reikland, and locals scrape together coin to hear their 
fortune, and buy charms and love potions. Most Mystics are perceptive 
and intuitive, able to divine their customers’ hopes and fears and give 
readings just specific enough to be believable. Mystics must be careful, 
and  walk  a  fine  line  between  accusations  of  trickery  and  heretical 
witchery. Mystics demonstrate their talent in a wide variety of ways: 
palmists and card readers are common amongst the Strigany, while a 
Wood Elf is more likely to interpret the signs and symbols to be found 
around them in nature, or to be inspired by dreams and visions. Many 
cults also have their own Seers and Sages, each prophesising the future 
through the paradigm of their beliefs.

‘I’ll tell you for why we have wheels on our houses: it’s because no-one 
likes to hear the cold truth of Morr a-coming, and if there’s one thing 
for sure, Morr is always a-coming. So, it ain’t because we’re cheaters, 
but because we are honest folk!’

 – Honest Chupra, Strigany Pedlar

‘I never met a Priest who could tell me what the future holds. Well, 
unless you count the Priest of Morr who Doomed me for thruppence, 
but don’t they say that death and taxes are the only things we can be 
certain of?’ 

– Sylvestr Jutzenbach, Ostermarker Noble

Mystics  might  seek  a  life  of  adventure  if  their  insights  draw  the 
attention  of  priests  and  witch  hunters.  Dreams  and  visions  also 
provide an incentive to join a band of adventurers: perhaps the Mystic 
foresees  a  terrible  future  ahead  if  action  is  not  taken?  No  matter 
their motivation, once on the road, Mystics can easily ply their trade 
wherever they should travel.

 ‘You don’t want to be going off the road down by the bluff without a 
guide. There’s man-traps in them woods what the reeve put down to 
catch poachers. Almost ’ad old Billi’s leg off last week it did.’

 – Gwyn, Scout

Scouts can be invaluable to a group of adventurers, especially those 
venturing  out  from  a  city  for  the  first  time  to  find  their  fortune. 
Reliable  and  knowledgeable  Guides  may  find  themselves  asked  to 
stay on and act as Scouts, although many still act the loner, slipping 
in and out of the woods to protect the group from ambush or warn 
of enemies ahead.

Scout

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Intrepid and resourceful, you guide others through the dangerous 
wilds of the Old World.

Among an illiterate populace where maps are rare, local knowledge 
can mean the difference between life and death for travellers. Scouts 
are experts at finding safe paths through the backwoods and muddy 
roads  of  the  Empire.  Local  guides  will  accompany  their  clients, 
warning  of  upcoming  dangers,  sharing  village  gossip  or  showing  the 
best places to forage. Experienced Scouts will barely be seen by their 
employers  as  they  explore  the  trails  ahead  and  keep  a  watchful  eye 
out for hidden dangers.  While most Scouts keep to familiar territory, 
some specialise in safely navigating unmapped terrain. Explorers might 
venture  even  further  into  treacherous  and  hostile  territory,  filling  in 
the  blank  spaces  on  their  maps.  Most  Scouts  do  not  tackle  dangers 
themselves, preferring to slip away quietly to warn their companions 
and enable their employers to avoid potential hazards completely.

You are the beating heart of rural life, working the countryside to feed 
civilisation. 

Sigmar’s  bountiful  Empire  provides  an  abundant  harvest  of  crops, 
livestock,  and  other  marketable  goods,  so  there  is  always  plenty  of 
work to be found in the countryside. Villagers make up most of the 
Empire’s population and perform a variety of valuable roles, including 
Farmers, Charcoal Burners, Woodsmen, Millers, Herders, and many 
more.  Most villages fall under the domain of a noble family, where 
day-to-day administration of the estate is overseen by a bailiff. Village 
affairs  are  usually  managed  by  a  village  council  of  local  tradesmen 
and farmers led by an Elder. A village Councillor or Elder can hold 
significant local influence overseeing many decisions concerning the 
surrounding land. 

‘It’s a hard life, for sure, but it’s a good one. Every year the lady from 
the manor sends out her guard to clear out the forest and drive off the 
beastmen and the like. The family keep us safe, we keep their flocks. 
It’s a fair trade most of the time.’ 

– Gunni Ackermann, Shepherdess

‘Look, you can sneer at me all you want, but Konrad the Hero his-
bloomin’-self was from a village just like mine, so don’t you be talking 
us down, you hear! Us villagers are good folk!’ 

– Erika Bauer, Farmer

The pastoral safety of a sheltered village is an unspeakable bore for 
some young Villagers who listen avidly to the tales of faraway lands. 
Of course, the stories they hear from wandering Pedlars and Strigany, 
all fuelling schemes to escape, bear little relation to the harsh reality 
of Empire life. During winter, when food is short, and the fields do 
not  need  tending,  young  folk  venturing  to  nearby  towns  and  cities 
for  work  often  never  return,  soon  caught  in  the  net  of  civilisation’s 
excitement and adventure.

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf

Ruthless and determined, you pursue your quarry to the bitter end: 
for justice, or for money. 

Bounty  Hunters  track  down  fugitives  and  outlaws  for  coin.  Most 
are legally appointed by provincial courts and receive warrant papers 
granting licence to seize or sometimes kill the target. While some are 
motivated by Verena’s justice, most are more concerned by the rewards, 
often finding the ‘dead’ in ‘dead or alive’ to be the most convenient route 
to  their  fortune.  Many  Bounty  Hunters  start  as Thief-Takers,  those 
hired by crime victims to retrieve stolen goods. Over time, those with 
an established reputation may find permanent work from a merchant or 
noble house, guild, or cult, or may build a company of Bounty Hunters, 
working as a group to collect the largest rewards. 

‘It’s amazing just how many boys will wrap themselves in manacles 
if you smile sweetly enough. And if that doesn’t work, it’s out with 
the knives!’ 

– Anke Dorflinger, Bounty Hunter

In their pursuit of wanted criminals, Bounty Hunters often stumble 
into  unplanned  adventures.  As  independent  operatives,  Bounty 
Hunters  are  perfectly  suited  to  dropping  their  day  job  to  pursue 
whatever  business  is  afoot.  Further,  given  their  broad  base  of  skills 
are  always  in  demand,  it  is  not  uncommon  to  see  Bounty  Hunters 
turning their hand to adventuring full-time, hiring their skills out in 
return for payments. Bounty Hunters are a perfect starting career as 
they present a solid mixture of social and combat skills allowing you 
to contribute no matter the circumstances.

Determined and rugged, you deliver passengers safely by coach 
despite the daily dangers you face.

For many, the coach is the only way to get from one town to the next. 
The  wild  places  between  teem  with  Beastmen,  Bandits,  and  worse, 
but  with  just  a  team  of  fresh  horses  and  a  blunderbuss,  brave  and 
hardworking  Coachmen  make  travel  possible. To  help  evade  danger, 
most coaching companies relentlessly pursue speed, and their employees 
have a reputation for ruthlessness towards other travellers on the roads, 
never trusting anyone. Coachmen often start as Postilions, riding the 
lead horse of the team through wind and rain. Instead of transporting 
passengers, some Coachmen deliver mail, work as chauffeurs for nobles, 
drive cabs or goods wagons, or the big omnibuses of the great cities, or 
even become a getaway driver.

shilling off me, and Castle Rock Coaches will be in here as quick as 
silver.’

 – Bettina Hoch, Innkeeper 

‘Three days I was stuck in Weissbruck during the storms. Not a 
single thing came in and out. Then just when I thought I’d miss my 
appointment in Bogenhafen there appeared three coaches coming 
up the frozen track, all together. Bloody typical! You wait days for a 
coach, and then three come along at once.’ 

– Stelle Grabbe, Merchant

Good  Coachmen  are  always  in  demand  for  unusual,  dangerous  or 
illegal  jobs.  A  Coachman  looking  for  a  change  may  find  winter  is 
a  good  time  to  take  a  break,  as  cross-country  services  are  greatly 
reduced. Coaching companies are always ready to snap up experienced 
coachmen, so returning to work is usually simple.

A wandering minstrel I, 
A thing of shreds and patches, 
Of ballads, songs, and snatches, 
And dreamy lullaby!
– Libretto from The Emperor of Nippon, by Guillibert and Solomon

‘How do you get to the Luitpold Theatre? Practise!’

– Well known Altdorf joke

‘Musician and prodigy, Vladimira Tchaikofiev, toured the courts of 
the Empire performing her compositions for the great and good. 
On her triumphant return to her native Kislev, during the reign of 
Bloody Katerin, she premiered her first opera, “The Vampire Counts 
of Stirland” based on her travels in Sylvania. Unconventionally, she 
always chose to conduct with a silver baton.’

– ‘A Defence Against Necromancy’, Patriarch Felip Iyrtu, 2415IC, 
from the 1st year required reading list, Amethyst College

The  open  road,  a  new  village  every  night,  the  smell  of  greasepaint 
and the roar of the crowd — life itself can be an adventure for the 
Entertainer  as  they  bring  excitement  to  the  humdrum,  everyday 
reality  of  those  they  captivate.  Given  their  existence  on  the  edge 
of  respectable  society,  curious  Entertainers  all-too-often  find  real 
adventures of their own.

Whether high-born or low-brow, you distract people from the harsh 
realities of life.

Entertainers  crop  up  all  over  the  Old World,  and  many  wander  the 
Reikland’s roads, earning their crust. Some stay put at a single theatre, 
some work as individuals, some as part of a troupe. The worst are little 
more than itinerant beggars, the best lauded in the company of counts 
and princes. It is not an easy life and the people will not tolerate poor 
acts, running them out of town pelted with rotten vegetables. 

The most common Entertainers are the perennial crowd-pleasers like 
jesters, singers, actors, musicians, acrobats, dancers, and jugglers, but the 
Old World is also home to more obscure and bizarre acts.

Just when you abandoned all hope, your suffering and the righteousness 
of Sigmar saved you!

Forgiveness  does  not  come  easily,  only  through  struggle,  pain,  and 
doing Sigmar’s will. Flagellants travel the Empire, flogging themselves 
in penance for their sins, and the sins of others. They are determined 
to serve Sigmar until the end of the world, something they believe is 
imminent. All good folk are expected to welcome, help, and feed them, 
and to pray with them.  

Most Flagellants wander in large groups, guided by a Prophet of Doom 
who interprets Sigmar’s will. Some follow armies, whipping themselves 
into a frenzy as battle is joined and fighting without any thought for 
their own safety. Others wander by themselves, believing they best serve 
Sigmar by righting the wrongs he guides them towards.

‘We strike this flesh and spill this blood, for his Empire, in the name 
of Sigmar!’ 

– Viktorina Schwefel, Flagellant

‘We had some flagellants going through the village a couple of months 
back. Terrible they were: the agony, the pain, the suffering, and that 
was just watching them. We knew what to do. We knew we had to 
open our doors and feed them and pray with them. But in the end, we 
just hid in the cellar until they’d gone. Scary folk.’ 

– Wulfrum Barth, villager

‘The Ende is Nigh!’ 

– Common placard carried by Flagellants

It’s not hard for Flagellants to stumble upon an adventure, especially 
involving  recognised  foes  of  Sigmar.  Flagellants  can  continue  their 
lifestyle as they adventure, relying on the honest folk of the Empire 
to offer them food, drink and shelter as they trudge ever onwards to 
the end of all things.

Swift and sure-footed, nothing stops you delivering your messages 
on time.

When  the  postal  service  is  unsecure  or  too  slow,  people  send  a 
Messenger.  Several  courier  companies  provide  express  services, 
competing to show they are the fastest and safest. Most Messengers 
take their duties very seriously, guarding their packages with their lives. 
Some  courier  companies  have  arrangements  with  coaching  houses 
allowing their Messengers to swap tired horses for fresh ones, for top-
speed delivery.

Runners are employed to carry urgent messages in cities. Many larger 
settlements host competitions to celebrate the fastest, with the winners 
taking prizes and lucrative job contracts. Messengers can also be found 
working for the military, noble houses, large merchant houses, and for 
criminal gangs seeking to maintain their privacy.

‘Are you Herr Schmidt of Hochplatz, Kemperbad? Erm, do you 
know a Herr Schmidt of Hochplatz, Kemperbad? Erm, do you know 
a Hochplatz? Kemperbad?’ 

– Willi Winkle, Messenger on his first day

‘It looked like an interesting package, if you know what I mean. I 
thought I’d just have a quick peek. Thought it was to his girlfriend. 
Thought it might be a bit, you know, juicy. How was I to know it was 
all that boring spying stuff. Where’s Bretonnia, anyway?’ 
– Rufus Drucht, Messenger who single-handedly busted the Bloody 
Bretonnian spy ring, then lost his job.

Messages  can  contain  all  sorts  of  information,  and  some  lead  to 
adventure should they be intercepted. The easiest way for any villain 
(or innocent party) to get hold of such information will be to waylay 
a Messenger. If this happens, it will be the Messenger’s duty to follow 
things  through  until  the  message  is  recovered.  As  Messengers  are 
usually freelance, paid per package delivered, it is simple enough to 
drop everything then pick-up work when they return.

Hearing  of  profits  to  be  made  in  far-off  lands  and  listening  to  the 
stories of well-travelled merchants is always going to whet the appetite 
of an ambitious Pedlar. Being self-reliant, they can follow up on any

access to strongholds and settlements without awkward questions.

PedlAR

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

Worldly-wise and free of interference, you wander the Empire selling 
your wares where you will.

Pedlars traipse from village to hamlet, selling goods and services such 
as knife sharpening, mending, and tinkering. Most carry cheap stock 
readily  available  in  larger  towns,  including  small  luxuries  such  as 
ribbons and hair pins. Pedlars are always welcome as even suspicious 
folk like to treat themselves to baubles and knickknacks.

Some Pedlars also take on messenger work; others act as de facto town 
criers, bringing news and gossip to the quietest corners of the Empire 
in exchange for bed-and-board. Given the dangers on the road, some 
Pedlars prefer to keep a stall at a regular town marketplace. It is also 
common to find them on pilgrim routes making a living selling relics 
to the devout.

RoAd WARden

Halfling, Human

With a wary eye and ready weapon, you tour the highways of the 
Empire enforcing the law.

Road  Wardens  protect  travellers  from  the  bandits,  Greenskins, 
Beastmen and other dangers that threaten the Empire’s highways. The 
Wardens  are  supported  by  a  system  of  tolls,  taxes  they  often  collect 
personally. Successful Road Wardens are well-received and respected, 
and  often  have  bunks  in  each  inn  along  their  route.  Most  main-
road  Road  Wardens  are  part  of  the  State  Army,  patrolling  primary 
thoroughfares during peace time, so are well-trained and resplendent 
in neat uniforms. Less-travelled roads make do with local equivalents, 
some of whom take advantage of their position and lack of supervision 
for their own gain. Some Wardens prefer sitting in their safe, fortified 
toll stations to clearing the roads, but travellers often balk at handing 
over coin when the roads are dangerous and in disrepair. 

‘What can I say, it’s a pfennig a leg. Them’s the rules. Nothing I can do 
about it. Perhaps you should try to find a different route to get your 
bees to Grünburg.’ 

– Andreas Muller, jobsworth Toll Keeper

‘So, I was stopped by a road warden t’other day. She said I should 
beware an unscrupulous character out patrolling the roads and 
charging hapless travellers a thruppence to let them pass. I thanked 
the warden for the valuable advice. “Taal guide you,” she said, “that 
will be thruppence.”’ 

– Ullrich the Pedlar

Road  Wardens  frequently  find  adventure.  Anything  untoward 
happening  in  the  countryside  is  often  close  to  a  well-patrolled 
roadside.  When  trouble  occurs,  Road  Wardens  are  summoned  to 
resolve  any  problems.  If  they  follow  up  and  become  involved  in  an 
investigation, they are simply doing their job, and might even secure 
extra pay for their time, even if the resulting adventure takes them far 
from their regular beat.

Witch hunteR

Human

‘I ain’t met a witch yet that won’t catch fire.’ 

– Father Linken Donatus, Priest of Sigmar, 
murdered by a rogue pyromancer

You hunt the illegal witches plaguing the Empire by any and all 
means necessary. 

‘If you’re not a witch, you have nothing to fear.’ 

There are few so feared and respected as the Witch Hunter, and they 
are  given  extraordinary  leeway  in  performing  their  duties.  Typically 
armed  with  silvered  blades  and  a  brace  of  pistols  —  for  lead  is  not 
so easily dispelled — they stalk all corners of the Old World ready to 
dispense judgement on any witch they find, or any who would harbour 
them. Most Witch Hunters in the Empire are attached to the Cult of 
Sigmar. Secular Witch Hunters are sometimes employed by provincial 
government, though these are little more than specialist bounty hunters. 
The  Colleges  of  Magic  also  have  Witch  Hunters  called  Wizards 
Vigilant who pursue rogue wizards, necromancers, and daemonologists 
— they believe it is wisest to set a witch to catch a witch.

– Walter Keller, Witch Hunter Captain, 
said the night before the burning of Almshof

A  Witch  Hunter’s  existence  is  one  of  constant  adventure,  often 
ranging the length and breadth of the grand provinces. They are called 
upon  whenever  the  foul  influence  of  unsanctioned  magic  emerges, 
and are expected to hunt it down. The bigger the reputation a Witch 
Hunter earns, the more dangerous the foes assigned, and the greater 
the adventures that follow.  If you play a Witch Hunter, it is worth 
while making sure others aren’t playing a Hedge Witch or Witch as 
this may immediately bring the party into conflict.

You ply the dangerous waters of the Old World, transporting people, 
goods, and the latest news.

Boats  and  barges  travel  the  Empire’s  waterways,  bringing  goods 
from  the  remotest  corners  of  the  provinces  to  the  greatest  cities. 
These  shallow-drafted  vessels  can  travel  much  further  upriver  than 
larger  ships,  and  a  comprehensive  network  of  canals  adds  to  their 
reach. Barge Masters are expert river sailors and have an exhaustive 
knowledge of their rivers. A Boat-hand is the dogsbody, but will learn 
the ropes swiftly. Boatmen crew merchant barges carrying cargo to and 
from markets, either working for themselves or for a larger Merchant 
House.  Many  Boatmen  are  also  ferrymen,  taking  passengers  across 
rivers, or to and from towns. In large towns, some also crew rivertaxis, 
sail pleasure vessels, or otherwise pilot boats on the behalf of others.

‘Someday a real rain will come. So, don’t forget your hat, madam.’ 

– Travis Binckel, Rivertaxi

‘Beware of forking. I say this as an experienced bargeswain. If you 
approach a dangerous rock or other river hazard be sure to go 
astarboard and stay astarboard while laying astarboard, or go alarboard 
and stay alarboard while laying alarboard. Or you will fork, and you 
might sink. And no-one wants to sink their forking barge.’ 

– Jacob Walles, Bargeswain who sank his forking barge

A boatman will not need to seek out adventure, for more than likely 
adventure  will  come  to  them.  Boats  are  useful  to  nearly  everyone, 
and therefore useful to almost any adventure plot; they also make an 
excellent base of operations. Boatmen will not need to worry about 
following investigation and adventure if the plot stays on or close to 
the river. Even if the plot leaves the river, they could still easily allow a 
talented Boathand to look after their business while they take a break 
from river life.

You pilot ships and boats through the most treacherous waters of the 
Old World.

Huffers are specialist river guides with expert knowledge of local river 
systems. They are a common sight near the most dangerous stretches of 
the Empire’s rivers and can command significant wages for what many 
view as easy work. Others view it as cheap compared to the potential 
cost of lost cargo. 

Many Huffers specialise in a single, notorious stretch of water, while 
others make their money at certain times of the year when the waters 
are  at  their  worst.  Other  Huffers  have  broader  knowledge  and  will 
guide  vessels  for  their  entire  journey,  effectively  acting  as  navigators. 
This is especially true of merchant ships with particularly valuable cargo 
at difficult times of the year.

‘A great big ship came in from Marienburg, low in the water and 
packed to the gunwales. I said that it would cost them a crown to 
take them through the Furdienst. Steep, yes, but it was a big ship. 
The arrogant Wastelander scoffed, said he’d do it himself. But sure 
enough, they drifted right into the shallows and were holed. They 
lost a good part of their cargo and it took them a week to repair the 
damage. Reckon it cost them a bit more than a crown.’ 

– Ilsa Dasche, Huffer

As  an  expert  for  hire,  Huffers  are  often  hired  by  wealthy  patrons, 
frequently  brought  in  as  specialists  on  journeys  of  discovery.  Even 
when travelling into the unknown, Huffers are useful for their broad 
range of knowledge concerning river conditions and piloting. Because 
of  the  regional  and  seasonal  nature  of  the  work,  many  Huffers  are 
ready  to  drop  everything  and  travel  to  where  they’re  needed.  This 
freedom  transfers  well  to  the  adventuring  lifestyle,  and  also  suits 
those  seeking  to  return  to  Huffing  should  adventuring  not  supply 
their needs.

Halfling, Human

Strong-backed and sure, you patrol the riverways in pursuit of 
lawbreakers and troublemakers.

A clarion call across the waterways heralds the arrival of the Imperial 
River Patrol, a river-borne police force known as much for its harassing 
thugs as for its good work. Most riverside villages and inns set aside 
moorings  for  them  as,  without  them,  worse  criminals  would  rule 
the  waters. The  overworked  patrols  concentrate  on  egregious  crimes, 
resolving petty misdemeanours with spot fines. On major trade-routes, 
the patrols have larger vessels manned by ‘Shipswords’ trained to tackle 
larger threats like Greenskins or Trolls.

Some  Riverwardens  rarely  see  the  water,  instead  manning  remote 
outposts overlooking strategically important waters. Others crew fast 
riverboats  charged  to  intercept  smugglers  in  the  night.  The  largest 
Riverwarden vessels are effectively sea-worthy warships, bristling with 
cannon and mortars, ready for almost any eventuality.

 ‘So back in the day, when I was a riverwarden, Big Willi came round 
to tell me I had to leave a certain shipment alone. He said I should just 
let it through and everything would be alright. Of course, I was young, 
wasn’t I? I told the ship’s Master all about it. And was I rewarded for 
my honesty? Nah, Big Willi came round and beat me up, and the next 
day I was drummed out of the river patrol. They were all in it together, 
weren’t they?’

– Nikki Schnelling, ex-riverwarden

A  diligent  Riverwarden,  searching  vessels  and  following  up  leads, 
might  stumble  across  any  sort  of  nefarious  plot  or  sinister  cargo. 
Riverwardens typically work month-long shifts, but this means they 
also  have  months  off.  This  structure  is  ideal  for  adventuring:  as  a 
Riverwarden need not desert their post to pursue private matters, or 
even have to persuade their Sergeant that it is their duty to follow up 
crimes. They can head off, investigate, and be back long before their 
next cycle begins.

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

Rivers carry most of the Old World’s traffic, and you stand in the 
heart of that excitement.

The  fertile  banks  of  the  great  rivers  of  the  Empire  are  densely 
populated, and the folk working day-in, day-out in the nearby waters 
and  marshes  provide  much  of  the  fresh  fish,  eels,  and  crustaceans 
feeding  the  towns  and  cities.  Unlike  the  inland  villages,  those  on 
the  great  rivers  frequently  receive  outsiders  who  trade  and  restock, 
meaning  Riverwomen  are  somewhat  more  open  and  diverse,  and 
often the first with news from distant lands. There are any number of 
diverse jobs supported by the river. Many harvest the Reik’s bounty: 
fisherfolk  (using  rod,  spear,  or  net),  eelers  (using  traps  or  pots),  or 
diggers  for  shellfish.  Many  live  in  riverside  villages  labouring, 
dredging, or lugging, and maintaining the Reik’s many thousands of 
vessels. 

‘If I drop this branch in the water now, it will eventually get to 
Marienburg. Unless it sticks in the mud, of course.’ 

– Jemima the Greenfish

‘They say the whole Empire will eventually float by if you sit by the 
Reik long enough. Well, I’ve sat here, rod in hand, for twenty years, 
watching the flow downriver. The things I could tell you. I’ve seen war 
and I’ve seen peace. I’ve seen good times and bad. I’ve seen happiness 
and sorrow.  And in all that time, I can honestly say, I’ve not caught a 
single bloody fish.’

 – Thys Lange, the Reikland’s worst Fisherman

A Riverwoman will feel at home on any stretch of water, and their 
skills ensure they can drop everything, confident that they will be able 
to find work elsewhere should they need to. A Riverwoman is well-
placed to get the lowdown on the more iniquitous side of river life and 
may have contacts among the river’s lowlifes. With their knowledge 
and  experience  they  can  make  all  the  difference  to  a  water-based 
expedition or investigation.

‘I can see the Sea!’ 

– Marian Zelman, Optimistic Reiklander Sailor

‘Yeah, I’ve sailed through Marienburg. Bloody Wastelanders made it 
as difficult as possible for us to get out to sea. I swear the huffer took 
us three times round the islands just for fun before we even smelled 
salt water. And they taxed us twice for everything. Even the ship’s cat 
got taxed. Glad to be home, to be honest.’ 

– Thom Wesserbrug, Boatswain

Beyond Marienburg, the whole world awaits a Seaman: the perilous 
Sea of Claws, the unfathomable Great Ocean, the exotic Thousand 
Islands, the Southern Sea, the Black Gulf. And at home, a Seaman 
can spend a whole life plying the Reik’s waters and never have the 
same day twice. 

SeAmAn

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

A life on the ocean waves calls to you, though many Reiklander 
Seamen never see the sea…

Seamen  sail  the  high  seas  in  the  Imperial  Navy  or  for  one  of  the 
Merchant houses. The Reikland may have no coast, but the River Reik 
from the Wasteland to Altdorf is miles wide and full of ocean-going 
vessels. The Imperial First Fleet that patrols these waters rarely sees 
the open sea, because the taxes to pass warships through Marienburg 
are exorbitantly high. 

Seamen can always find work, whether as cabin staff on an Imperial 
battleship  or  on  the  crew  of  a  small  trading  sloop.  Some  Seamen 
travel the world by working to pay their passage. The Reik also houses 
many ‘Missions’, buildings provided by the  Imperial Navy for  their 
staff, many of which employ Seamen.

SmuggleR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human

You  smuggle  cargo,  avoiding  taxes  and  risking  riverwarden 
inspections to secure maximum profit.

Most trade is legally taxed by local lords, as well as illegally taxed by 
bandits and protection rackets. Smugglers see themselves as charitable 
helpers: merchants make more profit, customers pay less coin, morally 
flexible Riverwardens take a cut, outlaws are avoided, and more besides. 
It takes experience and ingenuity to circumvent all the bailiffs, custom 
officials, excisemen, and busy bodies keen to stop them, but Smugglers 
dare the risks to support themselves and their families. 

Smugglers  come  in  many  forms,  perhaps  transporting  tiny,  high-
value  goods  for  nobles,  or  large  cargoes  for  shady  merchants.  Some 
Smugglers also deal in illicit goods, a crime that will incur significantly 
more repercussions than a burned finger or smugglers’ brand.

‘See, this is where the bottle of best Bordeleaux goes. The river wardens 
will search behind here, and find it, and confiscate it. That’s what we 
want because it means they don’t find the twelve bottles we have 
hidden under here. And if they find those, all is not lost, because they 
will be so pleased with themselves they won’t even bother searching 
over there where there’s twenty-four bottles.’

 – Hansel Solomon, Smuggler

Smugglers find adventure, even though they usually want things to 
stay quiet and uneventful. Any number of things can go wrong on a 
smuggling mission, and even if things go right, there will always be 
the lure of the next job, likely bigger and better than the last. Whole 
adventures can be played out solely on smuggling missions. Similarly, 
it will be easy for a smuggler to find gainful employment away from 
their  usual  work.  Someone  with  a  trick  up  their  sleeve,  an  eye  for 
detail, and a cool head when things get hot is always going to be a 
desirable companion on dangerous expeditions and adventures.

StevedoRe

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

You may officially load cargo for coin, but everyone knows the 
Stevedores rule the docklands.

With  their  sole  right  to  load  and  unload  vessels,  Stevedore  Guilds 
can slow or even stop trade. This grants power, with many docksides 
effectively  ruled  by  the  guilds.  In  larger  towns,  several  gangs  might 
violently  compete  for  supremacy.  Scowling  Foremen  deal  with  guild 
matters and blow their whistles to summon their gangs from riverside 
inns, either for fresh work or to defend their territory. 

A Stevedore might work alone in a riverside village, or in a large gang 
on  a  busy,  chaotic  city  dockside.  Sometimes  they  might  be  part  of  a 
criminal gang that just moves a bit of cargo on the side to cover their 
tracks.  Some  Stevedores  are  enforcers,  making  sure  everyone  else  is 
working hard.

‘Look, I know we specialise in coal, but don’t fence us in, we’ll port 
anything if the coin’s good. So, let’s do it afore the deal porters arrive; 
anything goes here, mate.’ 

– Albert Pförtner, Coal Porter

‘Listen, boy. Don’t think them dockers have it easy. It’s dangerous, 
claustrophobic work, with heavy goods and high stacks, and if it’s 
done wrong, the cargo may overbalance, perhaps even capsizing the 
boat. What I’m saying is, pay the Stevedores right — and if you want 
a boat to sink, pay them extra.’ 

– Aleida Fuchs, Merchant

Amid  the  humdrum  and  repetition  of  the  dockside  there  are  good 
opportunities  for  adventure  as  a  Stevedore.  Stevedore  gangs  are 
virtually  a  law  unto  themselves,  and  they  fight  for  every  foot  of 
riverside that they command. Stevedores are useful characters to have 
around, able to handle themselves, and deal with lowlifes.

WReckeR

Dwarf, Human, Wood Elf

You lure vessels to a watery doom and make off with their cargo.

Sometimes  the  gods  send  riverfolk  an  unexpected  windfall  as  goods 
wash up from an ill-fated vessel. Sometimes the gods need a helping 
hand: that’s where Wreckers come in. Laying devious traps and sending 
disorienting signals, Wreckers lure unwary river traffic onto sand banks 
and rocks, then loot the wreck, no matter how any surviving crew may 
protest.

Some  Wreckers  pride  themselves  on  their  clever  traps,  making  any 
wreck seem like an accident, and keeping a plausible distance from the 
actual looters. Some board ships by force and throw its crew overboard, 
expert at spotting under-armed boats with valuable cargo. These River 
Pirates  are  hunted  by  road  and  riverwardens,  constantly  moving  to 
evade the authorities.

‘We spied this juicy ripe sloop on its way to Carroburg just as night 
was falling, and lit some fires on the left bank to make them think 
the village was a few hundred yards closer. They tacked to starboard 
just like we planned and hit the sand bank dead on. Sweet as. How 
were we to know the boat was transporting a company of pistoliers?’ 
– Greta Lachsmann, shortly before her hanging

‘Look, if we let the crew live, they’ll tell the wardens where we operate, 
so the only sensible thing is to kill ’em all.’ 

– Mandel Stein, Pragmatic River Pirate

A  well-planned  and  executed  wrecking  is  an  adventure  in  itself: 
avoiding  the  authorities,  disposing  of  the  goods,  keeping  people’s 
mouths shut, and spending the ill-gotten gains all present their own 
opportunities  and  dangers.  And  who  knows  what  cargo  they  will 
find, and who may come pursuing those who stole it. Wreckers who 
come across such adventure will have no trouble leaving their old lives 
behind or returning to them again when times are lean.

‘Come to the Hammer and Bucket, home of the best music and

 – Raynald Schmid, Bawd

‘Scoff all you like, but those clothes cost money. For a lad born ’neath 
the dung heap, he lives a life of luxury.’ 

– Hertel Netzhoch, Innkeep

Bawds  living  in  urban  areas  sometimes  travel  to  flee  plagues  and 
religious  persecutions,  the  latter  of  which  crop  up  all-to-frequently 
in  areas  dominated  by  Sigmar  worship.  Others,  such  as  those  who 
rove  with  entertainers,  consider  travel  as  part  and  parcel  of  their 
occupation. Those who secure a patron might have significant lengths 
of time left to their own devices.

Street-wise and mercenary, you make a living selling illicit goods in 
the seedier side of town.

Bawds guide folk to establishments offering a variety of illegal and 
immoral services. Though many Humans and Dwarfs have objections 
to such activities, most Halflings and High Elves are quite matter-of-
fact about drug-dens, brothels, or other houses of vice. 

Bawds  include  drug-dealers,  dancers,  hustlers  and  artists’  models. 
Many famous masterpieces of the modern  era  have  been posed  for 
by Bawds plucked from the street. Traveling armies are followed by 
camp  followers,  with  Bawds  among  them  looking  to  make  coin  in 
any  way  they  can.  Ringleaders,  proprietors  of  establishments  where 
Bawds gather, can accrue significant empires providing services to all 
types of rogues, from fences who need discreet access to rich clients, 
to providing safe bolt-holes for gang bosses and crime lords.

Halfling, High Elf, Human

Unscrupulous and charming, you separate fools from their money; 
thankfully, there is no shortage of fools…

A Charlatan traffics in trust, yet profits from treachery. By preying on 
emotions and psychological weaknesses, Charlatans offer their ‘mark’ a 
prize that is too good to be true. Social privilege provides no protection, 
and even the loftiest citizens can fall victim to a skilled Charlatan. In 
addition to a knack for lying, a lack of conscience is also of benefit to 
Charlatans.

Charlatans  include  Swindlers,  Con  Artists,  Gamblers,  and  other 
Scoundrels  seeking  to  prey  on  the  gullible.  Halflings  often  operate 
distraction cons in small family groups. Young High Elves, slumming it 
with Humans, treat their cons as one big game, not motivated by profit, 
but to prove their superiority. Some experienced Charlatans work with 
artists, who forge documentation for a cut of any profits.

‘I’ve carried this across countless leagues from the highest towers 
of the Elves. See how it sparkles in the moonlight? Only magic can 
cause this inner light! Unbelievable as it may be, I must grudgingly 
part with it. For such power, any price is but a trifle!’

– Wolmar Rotte, Con Man

‘The last living heir of Lord Schwalb, you say? Hogwash! You’re the 
fifth ‘heir’ to call this afternoon! How much did you pay for that scrap 
of paper? Better yet, who’s the swindler what sold it to you?’

– Gerold Behn, Irritated Butler

To  avoid  rousing  suspicion,  Charlatans  rarely  stay  in  one  area  for 
long. Few Swindlers openly admit to their calling, preferring instead 
to masquerade as anyone other than themselves. Because of this, there 
is little stopping Charlatans from pursuing side-matters of interests; 
equally,  afterwards,  they  can  return  to  grafting  anywhere  with  rich 
fools willing to part with coin on naught but a promise.

Fence

Dwarf, Halfling, Human

A shrewd assessor of valuables, you’ll buy anything, legal or not, and 
turn it around for a tidy profit.

A  Fence  buys  thieves’  spoils  and  sells  it  on  for  profit,  often  to  those 
unaware the goods are stolen. Successful Fences sometimes operate as 
pawn brokers, importers, or other merchants. Others prefer to remain 
mobile, trafficking only in portable items. Though the average Fence 
deals  in  goods  and  valuables,  there  are  also  well-informed  specialists 
who  focus  on  information  and  forbidden  knowledge.  Some  Fences 
move stolen items across the Empire. A painting stolen in Altdorf is 
easier to sell in Talabheim to an audience unaware of the theft. When 
high  profile  items  vanish,  Fences  are  also  the  first  individuals  to  be 
consulted  by  those  looking  to  acquire  them.  Some  Fences  even  take 
commissions from clients, connecting them with those who can steal 
to order.

‘I know it’s stolen. You know it’s stolen. Even old Sigmar knows it’s 
stolen. So when I ask you if it’s stolen, don’t insult me by telling me it 
isn’t stolen. Lucky for you, I deal in stolen, so stop panicking.’

 – Elene Weslach, Mover

‘Why am I called a Fence? Well, it’s because I provide you with some 
de-fence from being caught, innit. So, you go thief, and I’ll make sure 
you don’t have to worry about how to shift the merchandise. Think of 
me like your partner-in-crime.’ 

– ‘Boil’ Vakram, Fence

The  search  for  buyers  and  sellers,  or  the  need  to  escape  a  terrible 
situation, can take a Fence anywhere. They can be found across the 
Empire  and  in  many  regions  beyond  its  borders.  Up-and-coming 
Brokers  transport  illicit  goods  between  Old  World  cities  in  search 
of buyers. Others, looking to make a name for themselves elsewhere, 
attempt  to  make  their  own  niches  in  existing  city  underworlds. 
Given that their interests often collide, Fences and merchants make 
occasional bedfellows, as well. With all of this criminal activity and 
movement, trouble often follows.

gRAve RobbeR

Halfling, Human

 ‘You can’t take it with you... but I can certainly take it with me.’ 

– Symon Schreiber, Grave Robber

You brave the threat of necromancy, stealing from the dead to line 
your own pockets.

‘It’s not just the jewels, Herbert. Look at all the bones! There’s 
professors in Altdorf who’d pay good money for these!’ 

– Tyle ‘the Ghoul’ Grubsch, Body Snatcher

Trafficking in bodies and body parts is lucrative, with high demand from 
universities and physicians for fresh cadavers. As well as the scholarly 
market, corpses sometimes interred with all manner of valuables can be 
found beneath the ravenstones in the tombs of Morr’s Gardens. Because 
their  labours  are  obvious,  illegal,  and  sacrilegious,  Grave  Robbers 
usually work under cover of darkness. Body Snatchers have been known 
to  cut  out  the  middle  man  and  take  beggars  or  other  unfortunates 
straight off the streets. Tomb Robbers avoid the legal dangers of looting 
the  recently  dead,  and  instead  journey  to  ancient  ruins  and  barrows, 
risking the restless dead and brigands alike. Peculiarly, some  successful 
Treasure Hunters find themselves celebrated as heroes, their treasures 
sold to, and displayed by, the aristocracy. It’s even rumoured that the 
great wealth of one of the Knightly Orders came from a group of their 
members plundering a foreign tomb.

‘The nightmares of Khemri still haunt me. The curses cast by those 
long-dead tyrants have sealed my fate. I only hope Morr can put a 
stop to the necromancy that rots my bones and blackens my heart.’ 

– Lady Estelle Hauptleiter, Treasure Hunter (deceased)

Grave Robbers easily take to the adventuring life, especially if their 
nocturnal  sojourns  are  discovered  by  unsympathetic  authorities. 
They  may  also  be  sought  out  by  antiquarians  who  wish  to  engage 
their expert services in the excavation of a tomb, or perhaps they will 
feel compelled to track down a suspected necromancer who is using 
corpses for nefarious purposes.

You prey upon travellers, extracting a toll from the vulnerable and the 
unsuspecting.

Outlaws ply the roads of the Old World in search of vulnerable travellers 
and  merchant  caravans. They  lead  dangerous  and  often  hardscrabble 
lives. Many do not see themselves as criminals, but as oppressed groups 
trying  to  live  their  lives  free  from  outside  constraints.  Many  Wood 
Elf  outlaws  fit  this  description,  pushing  back  against  the  Humans 
proliferating  at  the  edge  of  the  forests,  willing  to  take  more  drastic 
action than others of their kind. Particularly savvy and brutal Outlaws 
may form bands of their own, sometimes even uniting several bands 
under  a  single  banner.  Such  Bandit  Kings  are  feared  and  reviled  by 
noble and peasant alike. Though few Outlaws discriminate in choosing 
their prey, some claim to protect the common man. These do-gooders 
focus their larceny on greedy nobles and, in return, locals may provide 
them with food, information, and safe harbour. 

‘They were children, not brigands. Starving, filthy, sickly. They held us 
under the sight of their arrows and we stood fast… my son’s age, they 
were. Children. Killed six of us…’ 

– Valentin Behr, Road Warden

‘...and he says, “Titus, why d’you carry them shears?” And I says, 
“These?” And he says, “Aye, those’re the only shears I see.” So I laughed 
and answered: “Sometimes they don’t want to take off their rings like 
I ask ’em to. When I show ’em the shears, most of ’ em change their 
tune right quick. And if they don’t…’’. Hehehe.’

 – Titus Widmann, Outlaw

Outlaw bands are not all wild mobs, so many can be reasoned with 
if approached correctly. An Outlaw might be asked to accompany a 
group of adventurers as a guide or to protect them, especially if the 
group are trying to stop unholy activity in a Bandit King’s domain. 
Individual Outlaws may find it simple to join an adventuring band, 
although they may need to disguise themselves if they go anywhere 
the Outlaw is wanted.

You are part of an organised criminal gang, collecting debts and 
extorting money from the weak.

Racketeers  extort  money  from  law-abiding  citizens  and  merchants, 
providing ‘protection’ or some similar fraudulent ‘service’. If the ‘fees’ are 
not paid on time, the victims, their families, and their livelihoods are 
at considerable risk. Large gangs bribe or intimidate local authorities 
to  ignore  their  activities;  their Thugs  are  always  willing  to  kill  —  or 
worse — to keep business running smoothly. Thugs are employed to 
collect  debts  of  all  kind,  especially  those  incurred  through  gambling 
losses or high-interest-rate loans. In a world brimming with poverty, 
the  promise  of  easy  wealth  is  an  allure  countless  fools  are  unable  to 
ignore. The more organised the graft, the larger and more complex the 
organisations  running  them  become.  While  the  smallest  rackets  are 
run by small gangs with limited territory beyond a building or two, the 
largest can span cities or even entire provinces, and the Crime Lords 
who run them can wield extraordinary power. 

 ‘I hope you have Hazelmann’s money because I really hate the sound 
of breaking fingers.’ 

– Claus Betelhof, Well-Mannered Racketeer

‘IF YOU CAN’T PAE THE DEBT, DON’T MAKE THE BET.’ 
– Sign in Bosco’s Bones (Altdorf gambling house)

‘or bosco wil brake ya legs’ 

– Bosco’s Bones Sign Addendum scrawled in chalk

Thugs  and  Racketeers  are  always  willing  to  resort  to  threats  and 
violence,  making  them  valuable  members  of  any  party  that  expects 
to  face  aggressive  opposition.  Gang  Bosses  might  even  take  their 
business on the road, looking to expand their territory or explore new 
opportunities  for  intrigue  and  profit.  Given  the  competitive  nature 
of  such  rackets,  even  the  most  powerful  Crime  Lords  might  find 
themselves  deposed  by  opponents  or  treachery.  Forced  to  hide  or 
flee, such experienced crooks can seek to use a group of experienced 
adventurers to their advantage.

‘One creaky floorboard in the whole place and I’m the one to find it…’
 – Alette Zimmermann, Thief, Jailed

You steal from others in order to line your own pockets, and you’re 
rather good at it.

‘What the...? Those aren’t dogs... they’re bears!’

 – Marx the Mauled, Unlucky Thief

Thieves steal all manner of wealth and goods from their fellow man. 
From  the  lowliest  footpad  to  the  wiliest  burglar,  the  thought  of  an 
honest day’s work in return for a respectable wage is little more than 
a  bad  joke.  Thieves  often  organize  themselves  into  gangs  alongside 
charlatans, racketeers, and fences to further their mutual wealth. Bitter 
feuds  between  such  illicit  organisations  have  been  known  to  last  for 
years or even decades. The lowliest Thieves target individuals, picking 
pockets or waylaying victims in rat-infested alleyways. Burglars avoid 
confrontation by breaking into businesses and residences, carrying off 
portable valuables. More ambitious thieves scope out their targets for 
days or weeks, even going so far as to infiltrate their target locations 
to get a more precise lay of the land. Working with other professional 
burglars, such experts can organise heists of which their lesser peers can 
only dream.

‘No, the list of charges does not include, “Stealing the magistrate’s 
heart away.” You must have me confused with a magistrate who has 
a heart.’

 – Leonora Nithardt, Magistrate

Thieves who run afoul of the law are obliged to hide or flee from 
justice,  putting  many  would-be  inmates  on  the  run.  Sometimes 
the  very  items  stolen  by  Thieves  are  of  such  exorbitant  value  or 
supernatural quality they seem to attract trouble like a mouldering 
corpse draws flies, which can lead them into all sorts of unexpected 
adventures.  Of  course,  a  Burglar’s  talents  are  always  valuable 
to  adventurers,  and  reliable  examples  can  expect  to  be  well-
compensated for their skills.

‘Do you think only wizards can wield magic? Think again! I, too, have 
such understanding, and I refuse to become a slave to the so-called 
Colleges.’ 

Wilful and ambitious, you strive to master magic without an officially 
sanctioned licence to operate.

– Apprentice Franz Zimmel of the Gold Order, 
3 months before being captured by a Witch Hunter 

Any  with  the  rare  talent  to  wield  magic  must,  by  law,  be  trained  by 
wizards  of  the  College  of  Magic.  Not  everyone  accepts  such  a  fate; 
some hide their powers or go on the run. Such folk are called Witches. 
They risk insanity and damnation as magic burns through them without 
correct tutelage, and rarely understand the nature of the forces in which 
they dabble. Others embrace their burgeoning powers wholeheartedly, 
accepting  the  risks.  Witches  come  in  all  varieties,  with  the  talent  to 
wield  magic  playing  no  favourites.  Some  are  benign  figures  simply 
seeking freedom. Others are nobles refusing to accept they are Witches, 
for to do so is to be disinherited. Yet others are terrified of what they 
may become, so run away. Whatever the case, few will admit what they 
are, as all risk burning by over-zealous Sigmarites. 

Witches  lead  dangerous  lives.  Though  some  pose  as  wizards,  such 
deceptions  are  easily  discerned  by  anyone  with  any  knowledge  of 
magic. Nevertheless, bands of adventurers — especially those without 
unwavering faith or moral qualms — rarely care for the specifics of 
a  Witch’s  education  so  long  as  the  methods  used  are  effective  and 
have no truck with the Dark Gods. Although unsanctioned witchery 
is illegal — carrying the death penalty — most wizards have a brief 
experience  as  a Witch  before  entering  the  Colleges  of  Magic. This 
is  acknowledged  by  both  the  Colleges  and  the  cults,  so  a Witch,  if 
discovered, should submit to the authorities. Training in the Colleges 
could  be  covered  as  time  between  adventures,  meaning  the  Witch 
can return at a later date in the Wizard career, or it could become the 
focus of a new adventure.

A dashing and fearless rider, you bring speed, versatility, and skill-at-
arms to the battlefield.

Whether  it’s  units  of  Pistoliers,  Outriders,  Demilancers,  Horse 
Archers, or similar, Cavalrymen are deployed for maximum strategic 
advantage. On campaign, that means scouting, raiding, harassing the 
enemy lines, or defending foragers. On the battlefield, they are also 
particularly versatile, able to strike quickly and melt away. For speed 
of movement, scouting, versatility, and sheer élan, Cavalrymen cannot 
be  rivalled.  Swift,  lightly-armoured  cavalry  is  employed  by  most 
armies,  including  forces  of  the  cults  and  less  formal  armed  bands 
including mercenaries or private armies. Bretonnian armies make use 
of mounted men at arms, while Wood Elf Gladeriders are some of the 
most feared light cavalry in the Old World. 

‘Any pistolier not dead by thirty is a scoundrel.’

 –General Lasaal, Reikland’s 5th Regiment of Cavalry

‘An outrider came by yesterday, checking to see if we were safe. Gosh, 
he was so handsome and dashing, who wouldn’t want to go outriding 
with him? He grabbed my buns and was off like the wind. Never paid 
for them, mind.’

 –Lena Fluffe, Walfenburg baker

A cavalryman currently in the State Army is not just going to drop 
everything  on  a  whim.  Should  they  have  something  they  wish  to 
personally  pursue,  they  will  require  permission  from  senior  officers, 
perhaps  buy  out  their  commission  if  they  have  one,  or  go  absent 
without leave. As an alternative, they could be ordered to investigate 
matters of importance by their superiors? Mercenary cavalrymen have 
more flexibility to strike out adventuring, being little more than hired 
swords.

Your job is simple: keep undesirables out.

The best way to keep something safe is to post a guard. Guarding looks 
easy enough, it’s usually standing around doing very little. Guards live 
and die, quite literally, by how they behave during that one moment 
when they are required to spring into action. The best can command 
high  wages  and  are  entrusted  with  the  lives  of  the  Empire’s  finest 
personages  and  most  valuable  items.  Guards  are  everywhere,  from 
the  Imperial  palace  down  to  bouncers  who  stand  outside  taverns  all 
night, ready to throw drunkards into the street. They also include grave 
wardens  —  those  who  defend  Morr’s  Gardens  in  the  dead  of  night, 
watchful for grave robbers — and temple guards who defend holy sites 
and important priests. Merchants often employ many Guards to defend 
their valuable stock. Some claim bodyguards have it best because they 
stay close to their esteemed employers, and often partake of a life far 
beyond that which their station would normally allow.

‘I stood outside the shrine for thirty days and thirty nights, without 
fail. No-one got in and no-one got out. Of course, it turned out I was 
stood outside the wrong door.’ 

– Ernst Bluchard, Ex-Temple Guard of Manann

‘If you’re not on the list, you’re not coming in!’ 

 – Anonymous Altdorf guard to the Grand Theogonist 
at the coronation of Karl-Franz I, apocryphal

Guards can find adventure when their guardianship is compromised. 
Any  guard  worth  his  salt  would  wish  to  follow  up  and  investigate 
those who have thwarted them, and get whatever they were guarding 
back to its true owner. This could easily turn into an exciting adventure. 
Many of those going on expeditions will require guards to accompany 
them, to adventure, profit or an untimely demise.

Thundering into battle on a heavy charger, you dominate the field, 
spreading fear in your wake.

Many believe heavy cavalry are the pre-eminent warriors of the Old 
World. A massed charge is an awesome sight, but even alone a Knight 
can stand as a one-person army. There are many Knightly Orders in the 
Empire, the most famous including the Reiksguard, the White Wolves, 
the  Knights  Panther,  and  the  Knights  Griffon,  each  of  which  have 
their  own  gloried  history  and  mighty  heroes.  Most  Empire  Knights 
belong to secular knightly orders, partly because training heavy lancers 
is  too  prohibitively  expensive  for  most  nobles.  The  templar  orders, 
those dedicated to the service of a single deity are just as common but 
are  somewhat  more  independent.  Alongside  these  are  an  uncounted 
number of free-lances, mercenary knights, and disgraced knights, most 
of whom sell their lance to the highest bidder. 

‘The knight demanded I get out of his way. “Why?” I asked. “I am in 
the service of the people,” he replied. “Well, I’m the people,” I said, “so 
I don’t have to get out of your way.” He didn’t have an answer to that, 
of course. So he punched me in the face!’ 

– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers

‘Lady Myrmaelia Jaeke is the finest knight in the Order of the 
Blazing Sun. How can I be so sure? Well, I used to hold that title, 
and she bested me.’ 

– Birgitte van der Hoogenband, Abbess-General of the Monastery 
of the Black Maiden, former Knight of the Blazing Sun. 

Knights might be asked to venture out to fulfil a duty on behalf of 
their Order or be sought out by nobles and employed to accompany 
a  restless  heir  around  the  Empire.  Similarly,  templars  will  have 
responsibility  to  do  their  god’s  will.  All  of  these  provide  perfect 
opportunities  for  Knights  looking  to  adventure.  By  comparison,  a 
free-lance is just that, and a life of adventure is what they follow by 
default.

Pit FighteR

Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf 

You fight for money, for glory, and for the entertainment of the 
masses.

Watching  fights  is  a  popular  pastime.  In  the  cities,  organised  fights 
take place every night. There is money to be made charging spectators, 
and even more in gambling on the result. Winners earn coin and are 
celebrated as local heroes. Losers are hurt or killed. Because pit fighting 
is officially frowned upon, the fights are often controlled by criminal 
gangs, but the rich love to slum it on occasion, especially if it involves 
a little bloodshed.  The gladiators of Tilea are the most renowned pit 
fighters, though the chain-fighters of Marienburg and bear-wrestlers of 
Kislev draw a crowd. Pugilists and wrestlers might work a travelling fair, 
challenging the public to survive three minutes in the ring with them, 
or they might fight a celebrated opponent in front of cheering crowds. 
Knives,  clubs,  chains,  boxing,  wrestling,  there  is  an  almost  endless 
variation of styles and codes a Pit Fighter might adopt.

‘It was my big chance. The biggest fight of my life. Then the Hooks 
came and told me to go down in the fourth or they’d chop off my 
hand. Well, you know me, of course I went and won anyway. And I’ve 
no regrets. After all, there are lots of things you can do with one hand.’ 
– Sigurda the Bull, Arm Wrestler

‘Roll up! Roll up! Dare you face the might of Gosser Papa? Could you 
last three minutes with Resige Heuhaufer!’ 

– Raimund Heenan, Ring Announcer

Many Pit Fighters fall into their sport because they have the talent 
and they simply need the money. Some would jump at the chance to 
leave their seedy world behind and put their talents to a slightly better 
use. Fortunately, Pit fighters are generally free to use their time as they 
will, provided they turn up on time for the next big fight, and even if 
they don’t, there is always another pit…

A strong-arm for hire, you bully, fight, and maybe even kill for coin.

Protagonists live by their wits and their muscles and are not generally 
fussy about the sort of work they take on. A merchant might want to 
frighten  their  business  rival.  An  employer  might  decide  his  workers 
need a bit of encouragement to get a job done quicker. A noble might 
want his daughter’s no-good suitor to be frightened off. Protagonists 
are the ones they turn to, and those with the worst reputation get the 
best jobs. A Protagonist could be the brute in the local bar everyone 
knows  will  bully  for  coin,  or  with  the  reputation  for  unflinching 
violence. Some Protagonists have their own code of what they will or 
won’t do; others care for nothing but the coin. Some are simple bullies 
who resort to picking arguments and fights with likely looking targets 
to see if they can score any money from the situation. 

‘Remember Thommy Two Knives? I’m not saying he crossed me. I’m 
just saying you don’t see him walking round town no more, do you?’
 – Gilly Three Knives, Protagonist

‘Yeah, Big Yuri came round and destroyed all my merchandise. Said 
this town was only big enough for one lotus dealer, and that was that. 
I completely agreed, so I doubled his pay and sent him back to White 
Tiger’s den. And that was the end of that.’ 

– Toni Miragliano, Lotus Dealer

On the face of it, Protagonists are always up for an adventure because 
they’re  always  up  for  a  fight.  But  they  will  usually  expect  to  get 
paid for services rendered. Whether they will join others without a 
guarantee of payment is a question they will need to ask themselves. 
Could  a  hardened  protagonist  find  a  cause  they  will  voluntarily 
pursue? Perhaps they could even turn over a new leaf ?

You are rage and shame incarnate, seeking a worthy death to reclaim 
your lost honour.

When Dwarfs suffer an unacceptable shame and lose their honour, they 
take  the  Slayer’s  Oath  and  walk  the  path  of  Grimnir,  their  ancestral 
god of warriors. Covering their bodies in tattoos, shaving the sides of 
their head, dying their remaining hair a brilliant orange, and spiking it 
with animal grease, they set off into the world, axe in hand, seeking a 
glorious death.

Slayers wander the Old World hunting deadly beasts, such as Trolls, 
Giants, or Dragons. Because of the shame they carry, many suffer from 
bouts of depression, glutting themselves on food, alcohol, or stronger 
stimulants. The more foes Slayers face and survive, the more dangerous 
and crazed they become, hunting progressively deadlier creatures in the 
hopes of finding something that can kill them. 

‘We avoid them, if given the choice. They are outcasts and have no 
honour, only the hope of reclaiming such. Still, we’ll feed them, and 
give them a place to rest. They are Grimnir’s Chosen, now…’ 

– Dimrond Zindrisson, Miner

‘Herwig didn’t mean nothing by it, honest. He just asked why the 
Dwarf had them strange tattoos. It happened so fast, I didn’t even see 
the Dwarf move, just Herwig hitting the floor.’ 

 – Regimius, Stevedore

‘We’re all going to die, manling. It’s the manner of our going that 
counts.’ 

– Gotrek Gurnisson, Slayer

Till  they  fall  in  battle,  a  Slayer’s  life  is  one  of  adventure  —  they 
seek  out  opportunities  to  face  powerful  foes  in  battle.  Slayers  will 
occasionally  take  other  odd  jobs,  for  drinking  money  or  to  finance 
their travels, but will seek death along the way. All Slayers previously 
had a life and a career, so there is more to them than simply being a 
warrior with a deathwish.

You are paid to train, be disciplined, and, when the need comes, go 
to war.

By the command of Emperor Magnus the Pious after the Great War 
Against Chaos, all provinces of the Empire had to maintain a standing 
State Army. Soldiers are the mainstay of these armies, trained to fight 
as part of a larger group with individual skill supplemented by strength 
in numbers. Rarely encouraged to think for themselves, Soldiers are 
famous for their stoic fatalism as they are ordered from pillar to post 
in the service of their betters. Soldiers could be archers, crossbowmen, 
halberdiers,  handgunners,  swordsmen,  or  spearmen,  and  that’s  just 
in a typical State regiment. Dwarfs employ soldiers like Hammerers 
and  Thunderers,  while  Elven  rank  and  file  are  usually  archers  and 
spearmen. There are many other Soldiers, such as Mercenaries, local 
Militias (which are rarely better than Recruits), private armies, cult 
forces, and more. 

‘Go down to the bottom of the hill, the captain told us. So we did, and 
the general told us to go up to the top of the hill and await further 
orders. Then the captain told us we were wanted at the bottom.’ 

 – Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers

‘Though Lords and Ladies come and go,
A soldier’s life is all I know,
Karl-Franz commands, and we obey,
O’er the hills and far away.’ 

– Marching Song, Reikland 118th Regiment of Foot, 
‘The Greenbacks’

Soldiers  have  little  free  time,  but  they  still  have  adventuring 
opportunities.  Outside  campaigning  season,  many  receive  extended 
periods of leave. Officers of the State Armies can also command small 
bands of Soldiers to investigate unusual happenings in their regiment’s 
‘territory’ and some officers view this kind of adventuring as excellent 
training to keep their Soldiers sharp.  Non-human Soldiers will often 
be on missions in the Empire that are adventures by their very nature.

‘Surrounded, we were, Greenskins on all sides. They knew we were 
done. Then the priest raises his hammer towards the sky and bellows 
his prayer. And as the words echoed to silence, the lightning struck. 
And we were all unharmed, I swear to Sigmar. But the Goblins? All 
dead.’ 

– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers

While many Warrior Priests stay with the army, some serve their cult 
in missionary work, and others wander the Empire as they will. As 
such, Warrior Priests can be natural adventurers. Of course, to pursue 
leads to the ends of the Empire they might require the permission of 
their cult, and perhaps their commanders.

You bring divinity to the thick of battle, slaying the enemies of the 
Empire with righteous fury.

Some cults of the Empire have clerics trained for war. In the Reikland, 
the  Warrior  Priests  of  Sigmar  are  the  most  common  example  of 
this,  and  most  armies  of  the  Empire  are  accompanied  by  hammer-
bearing  priests  encouraging  the  soldiers  in  the  name  of  Sigmar.  But 
other cults, especially those of Myrmidia, Ulric, Taal, and Morr, have 
Warrior Priests of their own, each with their unique views as to how 
war  should  be  conducted.  Away  from  the  battlefield, Warrior  Priests 
are also expected to administer to soldiers’ spiritual wellbeing, as well as 
making sure morale stays high and discipline is ordered. Some orders 
of  Warrior  Priests  swear  oaths  to  roam  the  Empire,  seeking  heresy 
wherever  it  lies,  helping  where  they  can.  Others  prefer  not  to  join 
armies, but lead them…

‘sure, playing scarlet empress is 90% luck and 10% skill. But try 
playing without that 10%, and you’ll lose every time.’

– hermann Graumann, Gambler, raconteur and liar

During the game, you’ll find yourself in all sorts  of situations 
where  the  outcome  your  Character’s  action  is  uncertain.  Will 
you jump the ravine or plunge to your death? Will you charm 
the officious courtier, or will the guards be summoned to deal 
with  you?  How  well  you  perform  these  actions  is  determined 
by  your  Skills  and  Talents.  In  general,  Skills  describe  the 
capabilities of your Character, and Talents are special abilities 
or tricks you’ve learned. If you want to know how they all work 
in practice, refer to Chapter 5: Rules.

SkillS

Where Characteristics represent the raw potential of your body 
and mind, Skills represent specific areas of training, knowledge, 
experience. Each Advance you take in a Skill improves the odds 
of succeeding with appropriate tasks — Characters who are well 
trained  or  experienced  may  be  able  to  best  opponents  who  are 
more naturally gifted.

deTeRmining yoUR skill level
All  Skills  are  associated  with  a  single  Characteristic,  noted  in 
the  Skill’s  description.  A  Skill’s  rating  is  determined  by  taking 
its associated Characteristic and adding the number of Advances 
taken  in  the  Skill.  Space  for  recording  your  Advances  for  each 
Skill is provided on your Character Sheet.

Example: Sigrid has a Fellowship of 41 and has taken 5 Advances 
in Charm, so her Charm is 46 (41+5=46).

BasiC and advanCed skills
Skills are classified as either Basic or Advanced.

Basic Skills represent innate or common abilities that you might 
practice in day-to-day life. Basic Skills can be Tested even if you 
have taken no Advances in them. To do this, simply attempt a Test 
using the Characteristic associated with the Skill as described in 
Chapter 5: Rules.

Example: Sigrid has no Advances in Athletics. However, as 
Athletics is a Basic Skill, she can still Test Athletics using the 
Characteristic associated with it: Agility.

117

IV

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Advanced  Skills  require  specialist  knowledge,  training,  or  first-
hand  experience  to  even  attempt  to  use. You  may  only Test  an 
Advanced Skill if you have taken at least one Advance in it. If you 
have not, you cannot attempt to Test the Skill. So, no matter how 
intelligent you are, you will not understand the finer points of law 
without the Lore (Law) Skill.

Example: Adhemar has an Intelligence of 36 and no Advances in 
either the Basic Gamble Skill or the Advanced Heal Skill, both 
based on Intelligence. He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as 
it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills. The Heal Skill is an 
Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds 
beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!

gRoUped skills and speCialisaTion
Some Skills are classified as Grouped. This means the Skill is an 
array  of  related  Skills  under  one  heading.  Each  related  Skill  is 
called  a Specialisation.  When  a  Specialisation  is  mentioned  in 
the rules, it is marked in brackets.

Example: Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many 
related Language Skills under a single Skill heading. Examples 
of  the  different  Specialisations  of  Language  are:  Language 
(Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish).

When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate 
the  Advance  to  an  appropriate  Specialisation.  Sometimes  the 
Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you 
simply select one of the options on offer. In other cases — such as 
when a Specialisation is marked as ‘Any’, meaning you can choose 
one  Specialisation  —  you  will  need  to  select  a  Specialisation 
yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill 
description  and  choose  from  the  sample  Specialisations  found 
there,  or,  with  GM  permission,  create  a  unique  Specialisation 
that fits the Skill and best suits your character. 

Example: Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career. 
When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide 
which Lore Specialisation to take. After some deliberation, she 
chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned 
something of the Gods.

Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same 
way  as  normal  Skills,  with  each  Specialisation  handled  like  a 
unique Skill.

Example: Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain 
(Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting). This means she 
Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49 
when singing (41+8=49). By comparison, Theodora has a single 
Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but 
no Advances in Animal Training (Horses). This means she can 
use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting 
enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has 
no idea how to train horses.

Animal Care (Int) advanced
The Animal Care Skill lets you tend  and care for animals, and 
heal them should they fall sick or become wounded.

Having  a  single  Advance  in  Animal  Care  means  you  can  keep 
animals healthy without needing to Test. You can also enact an 
Animal Care Test to identify and resolve problems with animals, 
such as: 

Spotting an illness.

•	
•	 Understanding reasons for fractiousness or discomfort.
•	 Determining the quality of the animal.
•	 Heal  Intelligence  Bonus  +  SL  Wounds  (Note:  an  animal 
can only benefit from one healing roll after each encounter).
Staunching a Bleeding condition.
Preparing the animal for display.

•	
•	

In combat, you may appraise an enemy animal with an Animal 
Care Test. If successful, you and all you inform gain +10 to hit 

118

s K I l l s   a n d   ta l e n t s

when  attacking  that  animal  —  or  anyone  using  it  as  a  mount 
— until the end of your next turn, as you point out loose tack, a 
limp from a niggling wound, or highlight some other weakness 
or  vulnerability.  Animal  Care  may  only  provide  a  maximum  of 
+10  to  hit  per  animal,  no  matter  how  many Tests  are  made  to 
spot weaknesses.

anImals
Whether a creature does, or does not come under the auspices 
of animal care and animal training is up to your Gm. While 
certain creatures — dog, horse, demigryph — seem obvious, 
others are less so. you may argue that dragon should be covered 
under animal training, but try telling that to the dragon…

Animal Training (Int) advanced, grouped
Animal Training  represents  your  understanding  of  a  particular 
type of animal, and your ability to train them. A successful use of 
the Skill allows you to identify the Trained abilities possessed by 
an animal belonging to your Specialisation (see page 118). The 
Animal Training Skill also allows you to undertake the Animal 
Training Endeavour between adventures (see page 196). 

you  may  subsequently  use  your  Animal  Training  Skill  instead 
of  Melee  when  defending  against  your  target;  with  your  GM’s 
approval you may also use Animal Training to attack your target, 
issuing specific commands.

Example: Facing a slavering war-hound, Ilse passes an Opposed 
Animal Training (Dog) roll, in the first round of combat, causing 
Fear in the beast, and gaining +1 Advantage. In the next round 
she ‘attacks’ her target with her Animal Training Skill, beating the 
dog’s defence. Her GM allows her to instruct the beast to flee, 
which it does, its tail between its legs.

Specialisations: Demigryph, Dog, Horse, Pegasus, Pigeon

Art (Dex) basic, grouped
Create works of art in your chosen medium. 

Not having access to appropriate Trade Tools will incur a penalty 
to your Test. The SL achieved determines the quality of the final 
piece.  For  complicated  or  large  works  of  art,  an  Extended Test 
may be required. The Art Skill has little use in combat, but marble 
busts make marvellous improvised weapons.

Example: Irina has been commissioned to paint a portrait 
of a local noble, whose favour her party is currying. Her GM 
determines this requires a total of 10 SL in an Extended Art Test, 
with each Test representing a week’s work. 

Specialisations: Cartography, Engraving, Mosaics, Painting, 
Sculpture, Tattoo, Weaving

In combat, a successful Opposed Animal Training/Willpower 
Test allows you to intimidate a single animal belonging to your 
Specialisation; you cause Fear in the animal targeted until the end 
of your next turn (see page 190). When causing Fear in this way, 

Athletics (Ag) basic
Your ability to run, jump and move with speed or grace, and to 
perform any general physical activity. Refer to Moving (see page 
164) for details on using Athletics in combat movement.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Bribery (Fel) basic
Your ability to judge how likely a person is to accept a bribe, and 
how best to offer the bribe so they will accept it.

making  persuasive  arguments  to  stop  the  violence  (although 
good luck charming a Goblin)! 

A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed. If so, 
your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation 
using the target’s Earnings (see page 52), increasing the amount 
according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking 
the bribe. You then guess that target amount and the GM will 
tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your 
initial Bribery Test gives you another guess.  At  the  end  of  this 
process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what 
you have gleaned.

Example: Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; 
a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for 
Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly 
rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 
21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, 
and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. 
Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is 
open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess 
is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 
40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must 
bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim 
high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.

In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, 
but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation. 
If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your 
foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them 
off will be doomed to fail. Of course, if they have the advantage of 
numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?

Channelling (WP) advanced, grouped
The  Channelling  Skill  measures  your  ability  to  call  upon  and 
control  the  various  Winds  of  Magic,  and  is  solely  used  by  the 
magic  rules.    Channelling  is  a  special  skill  in  that  it  is  both 
Grouped,  allowing  for  Specialisations,  and  also  ungrouped,  for 
those  not  properly  trained  to  channel  magic.  See  Chapter  8: 
Magic for details concerning this.

Specialisations: Aqshy, Azyr, Chamon, Dhar, Ghur, Ghyran,
Hysh, Shyish, Ulgu (each is a different Wind of Magic, see 
Chapter 8: Magic for more on this).

Charm (Fel) basic
Charm  makes  people  think  favourably  of  you,  your  opinions, 
and  proposed  actions.  Passing  an  Opposed  Charm/Cool  Test 
allows you to influence the behaviour of one or more targets, up 
to  a  maximum  number  equal  to  your  Fellowship  Bonus  +  SL, 
affecting  those  with  the  lowest  Willpower  first.  If  a  target  is 
amenable to your Charm, the Test will be uncontested. 

Your GM may permit you to use Charm in Combat if they think 
your  foes  might  be  susceptible  to  you  pleading  for  your  life  or 

If you use Charm as your Action, calculate the number of targets 
affected as normal. If you use it to defend, you only affect your 
attacker. If you succeed, any affected targets will not attack you 
this round and you gain +1 Advantage as normal. You may do this 
in successive rounds until you choose to stop or fail a Charm Test, 
after which your words carry no more weight.

puBlIc speaKInG
the charm skill can be used to make impressive speeches to 
sway multiple targets to your way of thinking. assuming they 
can hear you and are inclined to listen, you can influence up 
to your Fellowship Bonus + sl targets with a single charm 
Test, influencing targets with the lowest Willpower first. If the 
crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the test is 
opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35). a 
failure shows the crowd is unconvinced.

the  public  speaking  and  master  orator  talents  can 
significantly  increase  the  number  of  people  you  affect  with 
public speaking. an astounding Failure (-6) (see page 152) in 
a charm test means your crowd quickly becomes an angry 
mob, with you as the target of their ire…

BeGGInG
the  charm  skill  can  be  used  to  beg  on  the  streets.  a 
successful  test  will  scrounge  Fellowship  Bonus  ×  sl  brass 
pennies per hour from passers-by, with the Difficulty modified 
by  the  pitch  chosen  for  begging,  and  how  much  sympathy 
your appearance can elicit. If you score no sl, but still pass 
the skill test, you only manage to scrounge a single pfennig. 
an  astounding  Failure  (-6)  means  you  may  have  attracted 
problems from the local Watchmen, found some trouble with 
other, local beggars, or suffer some other significant set-back.

note:  characters  who  are  caught  begging  by  their  peers  or 
associates will likely lose status unless they are already in the 
Beggar, or in some other destitute, career.

Charm Animal (WP) basicYour aptitude for befriending, quickly calming, or subjugating animals.Passing a Charm Animal Test allows you to influence the behaviour of one or more animals, to a maximum of Willpower Bonus + SL. If the target animals are naturally docile, this Test may be uncontested, but it will generally be Opposed by the target’s Willpower. In combat, you may use Charm Animal when facing animals. If you succeed, any affected targets will not attack you this Round and you gain +1 Advantage. You may do this in successive rounds until you choose to stop or fail a Charm Test, after which the creature’s instincts take over and you have no further influence.  Climb (S) basicThe ability to ascend steep or vertical surfaces. If time isn’t an issue, and a climb is relatively easy, anyone with Climb Skill is automatically assumed to be able to climb any reasonably small height. For any other climbing, refer to page 165, which also handles Climbing during combat. You may even find yourself climbing large opponents, though whether that is prudent is debatable. Consume Alcohol (T) basicYour ability to handle alcohol without letting it cloud your judgment or render you senseless.After each alcoholic drink make a Consume Alcohol Test, modified by the strength of the drink. For each Test you fail, you suffer a –10 penalty to WS, BS, Ag, Dex, and Int, to a maximum of –30 per Characteristic. After you fail a number of Tests equal to your Toughness Bonus, you are Stinking Drunk. Roll on the following table to see what happens:1d10Stinking Drunk1-2‘Marienburgher’s Courage!’: Gain a bonus of +20 to your Cool Skill.3-4‘You’re My Besht Mate!’: Ignore all your existing Prejudices and Animosities (see page 190).5-6‘Why’s Everything Wobbling!’: On your Turn, you can either Move or take an Action, but not both (see page 157).7-8‘I’ll Take Yer All On!’: Gain Animosity (Everybody!) (see page 190).9-10‘How Did I Get here?’: You wake up the next day, massively hungover, with little memory of what transpired. The GM and other players with you will fill in the embarrassing gaps if you investigate. Pass a Consume Alcohol Test or also gain a Poisoned Condition (see page 169).After not drinking for an hour, enact a Challenging (+0) Consume Alcohol Test. The effects of being drunk will wear off after 10–SL hours, with any Characteristic modifiers for being drunk lost over that time. After all effects wear off, enact another Challenging (+0) Consume Alcohol Test. You now gain a hangover, which is an Fatigued Condition that cannot be removed for 5–SL hours.You may expend 1 Resolve point to ignore the negative modifiers of being drunk until the end of the next round (see page 171).Cool (WP) basicCool allows you to remain calm under stress, resist fear when faced with horror, and stick to your convictions. Cool is generally used to resist other Skills — Charm, Intimidate, and similar — but you may also be required to make a Cool Test when faced with anything forcing you to do something you would rather not. Cool is also the primary Skill used to limit Psychology (see page 190).IV

Dodge (Ag) basicDodge is your ability to avoid things, through ducking, diving, and moving quickly, and is used extensively to sidestep falling rocks, incoming weapons, unexpected traps, and the like.In combat, Dodge is generally used to resist attacks or avoid damage. Refer to Chapter 5: Rules for more on this.Drive (Ag) basicDrive lets you guide vehicles — most commonly simple carts and lumbering coaches, not to mention the more ‘experimental’ creations of the Imperial Engineers — along the roads of the Empire with as little incident as possible.Under normal circumstances, if you possess the Drive Skill, there is no need to Test. If conditions are less than ideal — perhaps the road is in poor condition, or the weather is terrible — a Drive Test will be required. If you do not possess the Drive Skill, you may be required to make a Test to carry out even basic manoeuvres. An Astounding Failure (-6) on a Drive Test means something bad has happened. Roll on the following table:1d10Result1-2Snapped Harness: One horse (or equivalent) breaks free; reduce speed accordingly.3-5Jolted Carriage: Passengers suffer 1 Wound and fragile cargos might be damaged.6-8Broken Wheel: Pass a Drive Test every round to avoid Crashing. Two-wheeled vehicles with a Broken Wheel Crash automatically.9-10Broken Axle: The vehicle goes out of control and Crashes.Crashing: Occupants of Crashing vehicles usually suffer 2d10 Wounds modified by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points unless the vehicle was moving slowly (as determined by the GM). Crashed vehicles must be repaired by someone with an appropriate Trade Skill, such as Trade (Carpenter) or Trade (Cartwright). Spare wheels can be installed by anyone with a Drive Test or with an appropriate Trade Test.In combat, Drive may be used if circumstances allow — for instance, if the party is in a coach being raided by outlaws, and you wish to ram an enemy, or outrun them (see page 165).Endurance (T) basicThe Endurance Skill is called upon when you must endure hardship, withstand deprivation, sit without moving for long periods of time, or survive harsh environments. In particular, Endurance is Tested to resist or recover from various Conditions (see page 167) and helps you recover lost Wounds. Refer to Chapter 5: Rules for more on this.Entertain (Fel) basic, groupedAllows you to delight crowds with the spoken word, perhaps by singing, acting, or attempting a few jokes.  A successful use of the Entertain Skill means you have entertained patrons near enough to hear you; the SL indicates how well you have done. In combat, it is unlikely that Entertain will be of much use, although you may come up with an interesting way to use Entertain (Acting) to confuse or mislead your opponents. Specialisations: Acting, Comedy, Singing, StorytellingEvaluate (Int) advancedLets you determine the value of rare artefacts, unusual trade goods, and works of art. Everybody is assumed to know the relative worth of general items, but a successful use of the Evaluate allows you to identify the value of curious and unique items. A successful Evaluate Test may also alert you if the goods (or coins) you are studying are counterfeit — this Test will usually be Opposed by the forger’s SL on their Art or Trade Test. Your GM may apply modifiers based on just how rare or obscure the item is, or on your character’s particular expertise or background.Gamble (Int) basicAllows you to measure the likelihood that a bet will pay off, as well as successfully engage in various games of chance. To represent a gambling match, all players make a Gamble Test — applying any appropriate modifiers for familiarity with the game — and the player with the highest SL wins. On a tie, any lower scoring players drop out, and those remaining enact another Gamble Test, repeating this process until you have a winner.If you wish to influence the game through less honest mechanics, see Sleight of Hand.OptiOnssome players prefer to use immersive mini-games at the table, playing real card or dice games to aid the roleplaying experience. if you do this, a successful Gamble test will allow you to influence the game once — by drawing an extra card, or rerolling a die for example — as the GM dictates. Each SL affords you another opportunity to influence the game. s K I l l s   a n d   ta l e n t s

Gossip (Fel) basic
You  can  quickly  ferret  out  interesting  and  useful  news,  and 
spread  rumours  of  your  own.  A  successful  Gossip Test  means 
you have found out one useful piece of information, which your 
GM  can  impart  to  you,  about  the  local  area.  Each  SL  either 
offers  you  an  additional  piece  of  information,  or  the  chance 
to  spread  a  rumour  to  a  number  of  individuals  equal  to  your 
Fellowship Bonus. The time required for a Gossip Test depends 
on  how  circumspect  the  players  are  being,  and  how  busy  the 
area is, as determined by the GM. 

It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your 
attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something 
really juicy…

halF-heard WhIspers
While  it  may  be  expedient  for  Gms  to  quickly  share 
information  gleaned  from  Gossip  tests  to  all  players  at 
once,  it  is  often  more  fun  to  share  the  information  only 
with  individual  players  (either  through  a  note,  or  through 
briefly taking them aside). This means the players must relate 
this  information  to  one  another  in-character  —  aiding  the 
immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes 
and  misunderstandings,  sometimes  leading  to  hilarious,  or 
horrific, results. 

Haggle (Fel) basic
Haggle allows you to secure better deals when negotiating with 
others. In general, Haggle is used to see whether you do, or do 
not, make a good deal, most commonly with an Opposed Haggle 
Test. Specifically, it can be used when shopping to secure better 
prices. For information on this, refer to Chapter 11: Consumers’ 
Guide.

Heal (Int) advanced
You’ve been trained to deal with injuries and diseases.  A successful 
Heal Test allows you to do one of the following:

Treat a disease (see page 188).

•	 Diagnose an illness, infection, or disease.
•	
•	 Heal wounds equal to your Intelligence Bonus + SL (Note: 
a  patient  can  only  benefit  from  one  Heal  roll  after  each 
encounter).  If  sterile  liquids  or  appropriate  poultices  and 
dressings are used, no Infection will develop from the injury 
(see page 181).
Staunch a Bleeding Condition, with each SL removing an 
extra Bleeding Condition.

•	

A  Failed  Heal  Test  can  potentially  cause  Wounds  if  your 
Intelligence  Bonus  +  SL  totals  less  than  0.  On  an  Astounding 
Failure,  your  patient  will  also  contract  a  Minor  Infection  (see 
page 187).

If administering to someone who has a disease, a successful Heal 
Test  ensures  that  you  do  not  contract  the  disease  for  that  day. 
Each  SL  also  prevents  one  other  character  encountering  the 
patient that day from catching the disease. For each full day the 
patient spends resting under your care, the duration of the disease 
is reduced by one, to a minimum of one. For more information 
see Disease and Infection in Chapter 5: Rules.

Certain  injuries  require  Surgery;  see  the  Surgery  Talent  for 
details. For more information on healing wounds, refer to Injury 
in Chapter 5: Rules. 

Your  GM  may  apply  modifiers  to  Heal  Tests  to  reflect  the 
virulence  of  the  disease,  the  suitability  of  conditions  and 
materials, or the stress of your circumstances. If healing during 
combat, Tests will likely be Challenging (+0) at the very least.

Intimidate (S) basic
Allows you to coerce or frighten sentient creatures. The precise 
manner  of  initiating  an  Intimidate  Test  depends  on  context: 
while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a 
subtle implication or even a look is enough. Intimidate is almost 
always  Opposed  by  your  target’s  Cool  Skill;  if  successful,  you 
can  intimidate  a  number  of  targets  up  to  your  Strength  Bonus 
+  SL.  Each  will  react  to  Intimidate  based  on  their  individual 
personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but 
in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will 
not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat 
is the only way forward and prepare their weapons.

In combat, you cause Fear (see page 190) in all Intimidated targets. 
You  may  also  use  your  Intimidate  Skill  instead  of  Melee  when 
defending  against  those  afraid  of  you,  causing  the  Intimidated 
parties  to  back  away  from  the  fight  with  your  will  and  posture 
alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate 
to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop 
your  weapons’  or ‘get  out  of  here!’.  However,  if  you  fail  any  of 
these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or 
cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission 
you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this 
will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you 
having seen through your bravado once already. 

Example: Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 
SL on her Intimidate Test. Combined with her SB of 5, this means 
she can affect up to 9 targets, more than enough to impact all three 
footpads who now Fear Svetlana. As she has won by 3 SL, she 
gains +1 Advantage point until the end of her next turn. In the next 
round, she ‘attacks’ the footpads using her Intimidate, intending to 
scare them into leaving her be. However, she fails the Test, and the 
footpads realise they outnumber her, and are armed…

While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the Gm 
may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different

the Empire, replace Reikspiel with the local language. 

If you possess a Language Skill, you are generally able to make 
yourself  understood  in  that  language,  or  to  understand  simple 
concepts.  You  will  be  asked  to Test  your  Language  Skill  when 
a particularly difficult concept must be conveyed, or an obscure 
dialect or vocabulary is employed. 

Note:  Language  (Magick)  is  used  to  cast  spells  and  may 
occasionally be Tested, with… unpleasant consequences if failed. 
Refer to Chapter 8: Magic, for more on this.

optIons: Battle tonGue
Battle  tongue  represents  a  series  of  simple  commands  and 
gestures  that  may  be  made  in  the  heat  of  combat.  players 
with language (Battle Tongue) may communicate briefly with 
one  another  during  combat  without  penalty.  those  without 
the  skill  cannot  quickly  coordinate  their  attacks  or  discuss 
strategy once combat begins.

Intuition (I) basic
The Intuition Skill allows you to get a feel for your surroundings, 
leading you to notice when something is wrong, and gives you 
a sense of when people may be hiding something from you. A 
successful use of the Intuition Skill gives you subtle or implicit 
intelligence relating to your environment,  determined  by  your 
GM. This may be information such as whether someone believes 
what they are saying, what the general attitude is towards the 
local noble, or if the helpful local’s motives are as pure as they 
seem. If someone is actively trying to hide their intent, they may 
resist your Intuition with Cool or Entertain (Acting).

In combat, a successful Intuition Test may be used to give you +1 
Advantage  as  you  weigh  the  environment  and  your  opponents. 
You  may  continue  building  Advantage  in  subsequent  turns 
providing  you  are  able  to  observe  your  targets  and  are  not 
interrupted (such as being attacked); you may gain a maximum 
Advantage equal to your Intelligence Bonus in this manner. 

Language (Int) advanced, grouped
The Language Skill grants you access to extra languages beyond 
your native tongue. All characters are automatically assumed to 
be  able  to  speak  ‘Reikspiel’  —  the  language  of  the  Empire  — 
and their native language (if your character has one different to

lanGuaGes oF the old World

here is a list of the primary languages of the old World, and who most commonly speaks them. there are an enormous number of 
other tongues spoken, but these are the most commonly encountered in the reikland.

125

LanguageSpoken by…Albion…the folk of Albion, who hail from a far-off mist-shrouded island-realm and are rarely encountered.Battle Tongue…warriors of the Old World. It is very common amongst soldiers and mercenaries and is used for giving orders swiftly during battle. It was supposedly developed by the goddess Myrmidia when she walked the Old World as a mortal.Bretonnian…the folk of Bretonnia, who are commonly encountered in the Reikland. Bretonnia is a chivalric realm to the south-west of the Empire.Classical…Human academics of all kinds. It is the first recorded Human language of the Old World — over 3,000 years old — used in most scholarly texts of the Empire including wizard grimoires and many holy books.Elthárin…the folk of Athel Loren, the Laurelorn, and visiting merchants from Ulthuan. Elthárin is the language of the Elves. The tonal language has many dialects, and is notoriously difficult for non-Elves to learn.Estalian…the folk of Estalia, people of the hot, southern-western kingdoms known for their bitter politics and worship of the goddess Myrmidia.Gospodarinyi…the folk of Kislev, a hardy people from the frozen oblasts to the east of the Empire. The language is often called ‘Kislevarin’ or ‘Kislevite’ by outsiders.Grumbarth…Ogres; few others learn this simple tongue, though some mercenary commanders find it useful for communicating with any Ogres they may hire.Khazalid…the folk of Karaz Ankor, the Dwarf kingdoms in the mountains. This language is also wide-spread through the Cult of Sigmar, which venerates the strong relationship Sigmar had with the Dwarfs when he was mortal.Magick…wizards; a tonal language used to shape the Winds of Magic into material effects. The academic form of the language taught by the Colleges of Magic is called the Lingua Praestantia, which is quite different to the debased form of the language used by witches and the untrained. It is not a language used for communication.Mootish…the folk of the Mootland; i.e.: the Halfling grand province in the Empire. This language is little known outside the Moot.Norse…the folk of Norsca. Norse is commonly spoken across the north of the Empire in Nordland and Ostland, and is well-known in the Wasteland and Kislev, too. Reikspiel…the folk of the Empire. Reikspiel is the primary language used in most WFRP games. It manifests in uncounted discrete dialects from across the Empire, most of which are mutually intelligible. It is the modern version of the tongue once spoken by the God-King Sigmar when he still walked as a mortal over two thousand five hundred years ago.Queekish…the folk of the Under-Empire. Used by the Skaven and their many slaves. Few admit to speaking it, or even being aware of its existence.Tilean…the folk of Tilea, who are most commonly encountered in the Empire as traders or mercenaries. The Tilean Princedoms to the south are notorious for their deadly politics and their veneration of Myrmidia.Thieves Tongue…street folk of the Old World. Expressions of this language are highly localised and individual to each realm; e.g. Tileans sport a completely different ‘Thieves Tongue’ to folk of the Empire.Wastelander...the rural folk of the Wasteland, a windswept territory to the west of the Reikland. The official language of the Wasteland’s capital, Marienburg, is Reikspiel, a reminder that the realm was once part of the Empire.IV

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Leadership (Fel) basic
A  measure  of  your  ability  to  lead  others  and  command  their 
respect.  While  most  often  associated  with  martial  situations,  a 
resolute leader can quickly direct a fast response to a fire or other 
such calamity, and nobles use the Skill frequently to command 
their lessers.

A  successful  Leadership  Test  allows  you  to  issue  orders  to  a 
number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus + SL. If the 
targets  are  your  natural  subordinates  —  a  noble  commanding 
serfs,  or  a  sergeant  commanding  his  troops  —  commands  are 
usually unopposed. If there is no natural hierarchy in place, or the 
order is particularly challenging — such as ordering your soldiers 
to charge a Hydra head on — the Test is Opposed by your targets’ 
Cool. 

In  combat,  you  may  use  Leadership  to  encourage  your 
subordinates.  A  successful  Leadership  Test  confers  a  bonus  of 
+10 to all Psychology Tests until the end of the next round (see 
page 190).

Further, Leadership can be used to transfer Advantage to allies 
able to hear you; following a successful Leadership Test, you may 
transfer an Advantage to one ally of your choice, plus a further +1 
Advantage per SL scored, which can again go to any allies of your 
choice within earshot.

GM to supply you with relevant facts. If you are seeking specific, 
less well-known information, you will be required to make a Lore 
Test, modified by how obscure the information is, with the SL 
indicating how much detail you recall. 

In combat, successful Lore Tests may afford you +1 Advantage 
if  appropriate  (with  your  GM’s  approval).  For  instance,  Lore 
(Geology)  may  give  you  an  edge  if  fighting  in  a  rocky  cavern, 
or  Lore  (Engineering)  may  help  you  if  fighting  a  foe  armed 
with  a  complex  mechanical  device.  You  may  continue  building 
Advantage in subsequent turns providing the circumstances are 
correct (as determined by the GM) and you are not interrupted; 
you may gain a maximum Advantage equal to your Intelligence 
Bonus in this manner.

Specialisations: Engineering, Geology, Heraldry, History, Law, 
Magick, Metallurgy, Science, Theology

Melee (WS) basic, grouped
The  Melee  Skill  represents  specific  training  with  a  single  type 
of close combat weaponry. Each Melee Specialisation indicates 
training  in  using  a  specific  class  of  weapon.  If  you  don’t  have 
the correct Specialisation for a weapon you wish to use, refer to 
Chapter  11:  Consumers’  Guide  for  the  correct  weapon  entry, 
and what penalties you will suffer.See Chapter 5: Rules for more 
detail about combat and using the Melee Skill.

Example: Lord Ludwig von Schemp has been watching his two 
bodyguards discourse with some ruffians for three Rounds, using 
his Intuition Skill to build up 3 Advantage. Feeling it is going 
nowhere, he issues a peremptory order to attack the ringleader; 
passing his Leadership Test with 5 SL, he gives one bodyguard 
2 of his Advantage, and the remaining bodyguard 1 Advantage, 
hoping this will bring a swift end to proceedings.

Who’s the Boss?
Gms should be aware that having players issue orders to other 
players may cause friction within the party. If you have players 
who are of differing social class, or military ranks, be sure to 
discuss how this will be reflected in your intraparty dynamics 
to ensure a smooth and enjoyable game for everyone. 

Lore (Int) advanced, grouped
Having a Lore Skill means you’ve been formally taught, or have 
somehow  otherwise  learned,  a  branch  of  specialist  knowledge. 
Possessing a Lore Skill means you are broadly knowledgeable in 
the specialisation and don’t need to make a Test in order for the 

Specialisations: Basic, Brawling, Cavalry, Fencing, Flail, Parry, 
Pole-Arm, Two-Handed

Navigation (I) basic
Navigation allows you to find your way in the wilderness using 
landmarks, stellar bodies or maps. Possessing the Navigation Skill 
means you know roughly where you are, and can find your way 
between  well-known  landmarks  without  a Test.  A Test  is  only 
required if you are disoriented or travelling far from the beaten 
path, with success showing you the correct direction, or allowing 
you to avoid mishap. 

If  you  are  navigating  a  long  journey,  your  GM  may  ask  for  an 
extended  Navigation  Test,  modified  by  conditions,  visible 
landmarks, and access to reliable geographical information. The 
SL  required  to  succeed  depends  on  how  far  the  destination  is, 
with each Test representing between an hour and a day’s travel, 
depending on the nature of the journey.

Outdoor Survival (Int) basic
The  Outdoor  Survival  Skill  is  used  to  survive  in  the  wild, 
including  the  ability  to  fish,  hunt,  forage,  and  build  fires  and 
shelters.  Experienced  travellers  are  skilled  at  reading  the  signs 
of incoming inclement weather and finding the spoor of various 
dangerous beasts.

When camping, make an Outdoor Survival Test, modified by the 
harshness of conditions — for instance, a Test is Challenging (+0) 
if it is raining, Hard (–20) in a storm. A successful Test indicates 

126

you can provide yourself sustenance and shelter for the night. Each SL allows you to provide for one more character. If the Test is failed, you must make a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test or receive the Fatigued Condition. If you suffer an Astounding Failure, something untoward has happened, as determined by the GM; perhaps your camp is attacked in the night?When fighting in the wilderness, you may make an Outdoor Survival Test to receive +1 Advantage, in the same way as Intuition, to a maximum number of Advantage equal to your Intelligence Bonus, as you spy out treacherous and advantageous terrain that you can best use to your advantage.OptiOns:  GatherinG FOOd and herbsGathering food or herbs normally takes around 2 hours. hunting and foraging parties make one assisted Outdoor Survival Test for the group, with the Difficulty determined by the circumstances.•	Foraging: A success grants enough food for one character. Every SL yields sufficient extra food for one more person.•	Hunting	and	Fishing: if you have appropriate bows, spears, fishing rods, or nets, a successful Test feeds two people, and an extra two people per SL.•	Trapping:	Use the Set Trap Skill to place Animal traps (see page 303). Feeds the same number of people as hunting and Fishing.•	Lore	(Herbs): if you are instead gathering herbs using Lore (Herbs), a success gathers enough for a dose of the sought herb (see page 307), with each SL adding an extra dose. Gathering tests are modified by herb Availability: Common (0), Scarce (–10), Rare (–20), or Exotic (–30).Perception (I) basicYour ability to notice things with your senses — sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste, and any other senses you may possess, such as magical or non-Human senses. Your GM may ask for a Perception Test to detect something, like movement behind the treeline, the presence of a trap, or someone following you, modified by how easy it is to notice. Perception is also used to resist attempts to hide things through Skills such as Sleight of Hand or Stealth.Perception has multiple uses in combat, most commonly to notice important details beyond the immediately obvious about the surrounding environment and your opponents, as determined by the GM.Perform (Ag) advanced, groupedYou’ve learned a physically demanding art, perhaps as a way of making a living, maybe as a street entertainer or as part of a travelling carnival. A successful use of the Perform Skill allows you to entertain all patrons close enough to see and hear you; the SL indicate how well you have done.In combat, certain physical Perform specialisations may give you an edge. With your GM’s permission, Perform (Acrobatics) may be used in lieu of Dodge. Other Perform Skills may be useful in distracting foes, perhaps gaining you an Advantage if you can come up with a creative way to do so. And some Perform skills can be directly used as a weapon if you have the correct trappings, such as Perform (Firebreathing)!Specialisations: Acrobatics, Clowning, Dancing, Firebreathing, Juggling, Miming, Rope WalkingPick Lock (Dex) advancedYou know the mechanisms of locks and how to open them without their proper keys. Picking a lock is often an Extended Test, with the number of SL required to open the lock dependent on the complexity of the lock.LOcks and LOck picksLock Difficulty ratings assume the use of lock picks. Improvised picks such as hairpins and nails can be used at –10 penalty. Each Test normally takes a Round to complete, though the GM may determine some locks are particularity stiff or rusted, and take longer. If the GM deems a lock is sufficiently simple, unskilled characters can attempt a single Very	Hard	(–30)	Dexterity Test to pick the lock. The following provides some standard difficulties for locks typically encountered in the Old World.Lock TypeDifficultySLLatchAverage (+20)0Normal DoorChallenging (+0)2Secure DoorDifficult (–10)2Treasure ChestHard (–20)5Vault DoorVery Hard (–30)10IV

Play (Dex) advanced, grouped
Your  ability  to  make  music  with  an  instrument,  hopefully 
well  enough  to  impress  others.  A  successful  Play Test  lets  you 
entertain those near enough to see and hear you; the SL indicates 
the quality of the piece played.

Pray (Fel) advanced
Your  ability  to  invoke,  or  otherwise  commune  with,  a  deity. 
For  more  information  on  using  the  Pray  Skill  to  seek  divine 
intervention, see Chapter 7: Religion & Belief. 

Specialties: Bagpipe, Lute, Harpsichord, Horn, Violin

the old World’s a staGe…
While there is some overlap between the skills of entertain, 
Perform, and Play, each reflects a distinct group of Skills.

entertain is a Basic skill using Fellowship. It represents those 
skills of entertainment that anyone can attempt, even without 
training, such as singing or telling stories. 
Perform  is  an  advanced  skill  using  agility.  perform 
specialisations require training to attempt, and rely on physical 
speed and coordination. 
Play is also an advanced skill, this time using dexterity. It 
represents training in specific musical instruments, all of which 
need teaching and practice to perform well.

you should choose carefully when determining whether your 
chosen specialisation belongs to entertain, perform, or play; 
consider how the character will physically enact the skill, and 
whether an untrained beginner could do so with any success. 
after all, someone without any musical training could feasibly 
sing beautifully, but hand them a set of bagpipes…

In  combat,  if  your  GM  deems  it  appropriate  considering  your 
circumstances and faith, you may use Pray to meditate and focus 
your  mind.  Each  round  you  spend  praying  in  combat  —  and 
making  a  successful  Pray Test  —  gives  you  +1  Advantage. You 
can gain additional Advantage this way, up to a maximum of your 
Fellowship Bonus.

Further, if your enemies understand your language and recognise 
(and fear) your deity, the GM may allow you to use Pray in lieu 
of the Intimidate Skill. 

Ranged (BS) advanced, grouped
Whilst anyone can throw a rock simply using their Ballistic Skill, 
it takes training and practice to use weapons like bows and pistols.
Each  Ranged  Specialisation  is  specific  to  a  group  of  ranged 
weapons.  If  you  don’t  have  the  Ranged  Specialisation  for  a 
weapon you wish to use, refer to Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide 
to see what penalties you will suffer when using the weapon. See 
Chapter 5: Rules for full detail about ranged combat.

Specialisations: Blackpowder, Bow, Crossbow, Engineering, 
Entangling, Explosives, Sling, Throwing

Research (Int) advanced
How  adept  you  are  at  pulling  useful  and  frequently  obscure 
knowledge  from 
libraries  and  other  such  storehouses  of 
information. Research requires you have the Read/Write Talent 
(see page142).

Simply  possessing  the  Research  Skill  indicates  you  can  find 
straightforward  information  from  a  clearly  indexed  library 
without  a  Test  given  enough  time.  If  you  are  seeking  specific, 

s K I l l s   a n d   ta l e n t s

to be able to scull about a pond, or over a gentle river, without 
a  Test.  Those  without  the  skill  may  have  to  make  a  Test  for 
anything but the most basic manoeuvres.

Sail (Ag) advanced, grouped
Your ability to operate and manoeuvre a sailing vessel — including 
knotwork, steering, gauging the wind, and more. Assuming you 
have enough trained crew for your vessel, you only use the Sail 
Skill when you must push your vessel to perform, either by racing, 
navigating particularly dangerous shoals, struggling against bad 
weather, or similar difficulties. Simply sailing with a gentle wind, 
or guiding a ship downriver, doesn’t require a Test for those with 
Sail. The  skill  can  also  be  used  for  sailing-related  activities  like 
tying knots, or tying others up in knots.

As sailing one ship is not so different to sailing another, having 
any Sail Speciality makes all other Sail Specialities Basic Skills 
for you.

Specialisations: Barge, Caravel, Cog, Frigate, Wolfship

Secret Signs (Int) advanced, grouped
You’ve  been  taught  how  to  use  clandestine  markings  only 
intelligible to members of a select group.  There are all manner 
of  reasons  why  someone  may  want  to  leave  a  secret  message: 
vagabonds might indicate which homeowners are likely to offer 
alms, thieves may want to indicate weaknesses, or likely marks, 
while scouts may want to warn one another about a dangerous 
monster’s lair nearby.

This Skill does not usually need to be Tested — you can decipher 
any appropriate signs you can see if you have this Skill. But if the 
signs  have  been  disturbed,  worn  away,  or  if  you  are  pressed  for 
time, then a Test will likely be required. Most messages are very 
simple, no more than three words.

Specialisations: Grey Order, Guild (any one), Ranger, Scout, 
Thief, Vagabond

less  well-known  information,  or  you  are  in  a  rush,  you  will  be 
required to make an Extended Research Test, with the Difficulty 
modified by the library size, and the target SL depending upon 
the obscurity of the topic.

Research  has  no  use  in  combat  beyond  perhaps  finding  you  a 
useful manual on sword-fighting techniques.

research and lIBrarIes
libraries of the old World vary from small personal libraries 
of a few dozen books to vast archives found in the universities 
and temples of the towns and cities.

Using a Research Test in a small library, perhaps to find a 
specific  book,  only  takes  about  5  minutes.  By  comparison, 
research tests in large libraries can easily takes an hour or 
more per Test, but are far more likely to find esoteric lore.

Ride (Ag) basic, grouped
How proficient you are at riding a particular group of animals; 
Ride  (Horse),  for  example,  will  let  you  ride  Horses,  Mules, 
Donkeys, and similar. You’ll only need to make a Test when doing 
something out of the ordinary, such as racing, dressage, traversing 
dangerous  terrain,  or  charging  into  combat.  Otherwise,  if  you 
have at least one Advance in the Skill, you are presumed to be 
able to ride around without need of a Test.

If  mounted  on  a  steed,  you  move  using  the  steed’s  Movement 
statistic; if you wish to run, jump, or leap, you use your Ride Skill, 
not Athletics. An extended Ride Test may be needed if you are 
racing somewhere, the target SL depending on the length of the 
journey,  the  number  of  Tests  indicating  how  long  you  take  to 
arrive. A Ride Test may be modified by environmental conditions, 
and the temperament of your mount. For more information on 
mounts, see Chapter 12: Bestiary.

The Ride skill can be used extensively in combat. See Chapter 5: 
Rules, for more on mounted combat.

Specialisations: Demigryph, Great Wolf, Griffon, Horse, 
Pegasus

Row (S) basic
Your  prowess  at  pulling  an  oar  and  moving  a  boat  through  the 
water. The Row Skill is typically only used when racing, navigating 
rapids, desperately avoiding Bog Octopuses, or similar unusual or 
dangerous feats. Anyone with the Skill is automatically presumed

I Saw The SIgn…This is a list of the primary secret signs of the Old world, and those who use them. This is only a tiny sample of those most commonly used in the Reikland; there are many more than this short list suggests, and you are encouraged to create those best fitting your game.Secret SignsUsed by…Grey Order…Grey Wizards. The secretive Greys use a complex array of signs, many only perceptible to wizards. They mark the land for their wandering wizards, highlighting safe houses, places of danger, areas where wizards are unwelcome, and much more besides.Guilder…guilders. Many of the larger guilds, from masons to stevedores, have an array of marks and signs used to identify matters of importance to their members.Ranger…woodsmen and other rural folk. Ranger signs are mostly used to mark territory, point out areas of importance or danger, and indicate safe paths.Scout…scouts, particularly those employed by armies and mercenary companies. The signs are mostly used to point out foraging areas, routes for supply trains, and significant dangers ahead.Thief…thieves and rogues. The various gangs and criminal outfits of the towns and cities use a variety of marks to point out bolt holes, easy marks, well-patrolled areas, and more.Vagabond…wandering vagabonds and pedlars. Vagabond signs are mostly used to identify safe places to sleep, villages to avoid, and sources of food and water.Set Trap (Dex) advancedFrom a simple snare, or bear-trap, to more spectacular devices like Von Grizzel’s Thief-Render, players are unlikely to venture far in the Old World without encountering traps. The Set Trap Skill measures your ability to set and disarm traps of all varieties. Anyone with the skill is automatically assumed to be able to activate and disarm traps given enough time. A Test is normally only required if attempting to use the Skill swiftly or if otherwise under pressure, or if the trap is especially complex. A selection of simple traps can be found in Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide.Setting or disarming most traps requires an Average (+20%) Set Trap Test, but more complex devices may require an extended Test, needing several SL over multiple rounds to set. Sleight of Hand (Dex) advancedLets you pick pockets, palm objects, and perform minor tricks of prestidigitation, as well as cheating with games of chance. This Skill is typically Opposed by the Perception Skill of your target; success means you have palmed the object, picked the pocket, or swapped the cards, while a Marginal Success (+0 to +1) may suggest that your nefarious misdeeds have left your opponent suspicious.You can also use Sleight of Hand to ‘help’ your Gamble Skill when playing appropriate games of chance. Before any round (or similar, depending upon the game at hand) you can attempt a Sleight of Hand Test (which will be opposed if others suspect). If successful, you may reverse your Gamble Test for the round if this will score a Success. If failed, your opponents may not be best pleased…Sleight of Hand and combat rarely mix, though inventive players may be able to conjure an impressive distraction with GM approval, perhaps even gaining Advantage by making a Dagger seemingly appear from nowhere, surprising a superstitious foe.Stealth (Ag) basic, groupedAllows you to creep quietly and conceal yourself in shadows more readily than most.  Stealth is generally Opposed by an opponent’s Perception Skill, and Tests will be modified by how dark or well concealed your route is, as well as how circumspectly you are dressed. An Impressive or Astounding Failure on a Stealth Test will likely draw the immediate attention of the enemies you were trying to avoid in the first place.Stealth has many potential applications in combat, most usefully to hide oneself in preparation for an Ambush, or to creep around an opponent in order to attack from behind. See Chapter 5: Rules for the implications of this. Of course, you can also use the Skill to escape a conflict unseen…Specialisations: Rural, Underground, UrbanOpTIOnS: ShadOwIngShadowing is following someone secretly. To do this requires a Combined perception and Stealth Test (see page 155). If the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with the target’s Stealth Skill. If you pass the perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you follow your target, but are spotted. If you fail the perception Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go unnoticed.  s K I l l s   a n d   ta l e n t s

IV

Swim (S) advanced
Your ability to swim in water without drowning.  If you have the 
Swim Skill, you are automatically presumed to be able to swim 
freely without a Test. But if you find yourself in difficult currents, 
racing, or fleeing from an oversized shark sent by Stromfels, the 
God of Drowning, a Test will be required. This may be modified 
by  the  condition  of  the  water,  or  how  encumbered  you  are  by 
clothes, armour, and other trappings. 

Swim is only used in combat if you happen to be fighting in the 
water, where it replaces Skills like Athletics to govern Movement. 
If  exact  speeds  are  required,  you  swim  at  half  your  Movement 
rate, using the normal rules for moving found on page 164.

Track (I) advanced
Your  ability  to  follow  subtle  trails  left  by  others. Track  is  used 
to  follow  difficult  trails  across  the  wilderness.  This  is  not  a 
skill  for  following  a  set  of  footprints  in  the  snow  —  a  simple 
Perception test covers that — Track involves deeper knowledge 
and  awareness  used  to  recognise  the  subtle  signs  of  a  quarry’s 
passage. You can also attempt to hide your trail, in which case use 
your Track skill to oppose your pursuer’s Track Test. 

Often  an  Extended  Track  Test  is  required  to  follow  a  trail, 
with  the  Difficulty  modified  by  how  fresh  the  tracks  are,  and 
how  suitable  the  ground  is:  damp  earth  betrays  passage  better 
than  stony  ground. The  GM  may  also  use  the  Pursuit  rules  to 
determine if you manage to track down a fleeing quarry (see page 
166).

Trade (Dex) advanced, grouped
Most folk of the Reikland follow a trade; even adventurers often 
have a more reliable, or respectable career to fall back on, between 
bouts of hair-raising, bowel-loosening excitement. 

The  Trade  Skill  represents  your  ability  to  create  something  or 
provide a service, as well as your knowledge of the relevant lore 
surrounding your trade. 

Having  the  Skill  is  enough  to  automatically  perform  the  tasks 
associated  with  your  trade,  assuming  you  have  the  correct 
resources and tools. You need only Test your Trade Skill if you 
are seeking to create something quickly, conditions are adverse, or 
you are seeking to invent or create a high-quality item.

Often Trade Tests of this type are extended Test, with the SL and 
time required depending upon the scope or scale of what is being 
produced; a quick meal with Trade (Cook) to impress a local lord 
will  take  far  less  time  than  constructing  a  warship  with Trade 
(Shipwright).

You  may  also  make  a Trade Test  as  a  Lore  Skill,  to  determine 
information  relevant  to  the  trade 
in  question.  In  such 
circumstances, the GM may prefer to use Int over Dex as the base 
Characteristic, though often this is ignored to keep play simple.

While  most  Trade  Skills  have  little  function  in  combat,  there 
are  as  many  Trade  Skills  as  there  are  trades,  and  some  may 
be  of  use  depending  upon  the  circumstances.  For  example,  a 
successful Trade (Apothecary) Test may be useful if fighting in 
an Apothecary’s shop as you identify some astringent chemicals 
to hurl at your foes.

The Trade Skill is also used for enacting a Crafting Endeavour 
(see page 197).

Cook, Embalmer, Smith, Tanner

dictated by the GM. This could include: seeing an eagle beyond 
everyone  else’s  eyeshot,  smelling  an  almost  odourless  poison, 
hearing the breath of an unmoving mouse within a wall, feeling a 
worn away letter in a carving, or tasting that two beers from the 
same brewer have been drawn from two different barrels.

Aethyric Attunement
Max: Initiative Bonus
Test: Channelling (Any)
Your experience, talent or training lets you more safely manipulate 
the Winds  of  Magic. You  do  not  suffer  a  Miscast  if  you  roll  a 
double on a successful Channel Test.

Alley Cat
Max: Initiative Bonus
Test: Stealth (Urban)
You  are  at  home  in  shadowy  backstreets.  When  using  Stealth 
(Urban), you may reverse the dice of any failed Test if this will 
score a Success.

Where  Characteristics  represent  your  raw  potential,  and  Skills 
are your training and experience, Talents represent all the tricks, 
quirks, and special abilities you have learned throughout life.

gaining TalenTs
During  character  creation  you  will  automatically  receive  a 
selection of Talents (see Chapter 2: Character). After this, you 
can use Experience Points (XP) to purchase new Talents, or take 
existing ones multiple times, if allowed, from the advance scheme 
of your Career (see page 48).

If you can take a Talent multiple times, it may have a special rule 
for what this means written into its description. Further, it may 
have an associated Skill marked under ‘Tests’ (see Talent Format): 
if so, for each time you have the Talent, you gain +1 SL on any 
successful use of a Skill tied to the Talent.

talent Format

the following explains how each talent is presented.

•	 talent name (situation): the name of the talent. If there 
are parentheses, the word within describes a situation the 
Talent influences.

•	 max: the maximum number of times the talent may be 
taken, which is normally 1 or an associated characteristic 
Bonus.

•	 tests: If the talent is tied to one or more tests your 
character  can  make,  the  affected  tests  are  listed  here. 
talents tied to a test come with an extra rule: For each 
time you have taken the talent, you gain +1 sl on any 
successful use of the skill tied to the talent.

•	 description (not titled): a description of what the talent 

does.

Accurate Shot
Max: Ballistic Skill Bonus
You are an exceptional shot and know where to shoot an enemy 
in  order  to  inflict  maximum  damage.  You  deal  your  Accurate 
Shot level in extra Damage with all ranged weapons. 

Acute Sense (Sense)
Max: Initiative Bonus
Test: Perception (Sense)
One of your primary five senses is highly developed, allowing you 
to spot what others miss. You may take Perception Tests to detect 
normally  imperceptible  details  with  the  associated  sense,  as 

Ambidextrous
Max: 2
You  can  use  your  off-hand  far  better  than  most  folk,  either  by 
training or innate talent. You only suffer a penalty of –10 to Tests 
relying solely on your secondary hand, not –20. If you have this 
Talent twice, you suffer no penalty at all.

Animal Affinity
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Charm Animal
Wild animals feel comfortable in your presence, and often follow 
your lead. All creatures with the Bestial Trait not trained to be 
belligerent will automatically be calm in your presence unless they 
have a reason not to be, such as pain, an attack, being naturally 
hyper-aggressive, or having nearby young.

Arcane Magic (Lore)
Max: 1
You either study one of the 8 Arcane Lores of Magic — Beasts, 
Death,  Fire,  Heavens,  Metal,  Shadow,  Light,  or  Life  —  or 
practice a lesser known Lore, such as Hedgecraft or Necromancy. 
You  may  now  memorise  spells  from  your  chosen  Lore  for  the 
following cost in XP.

Number of Spells Currently Known  XP Cost for a new spell

Up to Intelligence Bonus × 1 
Up to Intelligence Bonus × 2 
Up to Intelligence Bonus × 3 
Up to Intelligence Bonus × 4 

...and so on.

100 XP
200 XP
300 XP
400 XP

So,  if  your  Intelligence  Bonus  is  4,  it  will  cost  you  100  XP  for 
the first spell, and the next 4, then 200 XP for the next 4, and 
so on. Full rules for learning new spells are provided in Chapter 
8: Magic. Under normal circumstances, you may not learn more 
than  one Arcane Magic (Lore)  Talent.  Further,  you  may  not 
learn  the Bless  or Invoke  Talents  when  you  have  the Arcane 
Magic Talent. You can unlearn this Talent for 100 XP, but will 
immediately lose all of your spells if you do so.

Argumentative
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm Tests when arguing and debating
You  are  used  to  arguing  your  points  and  winning.  If  you  roll 
a  successful  Charm Test  to  debate  with  an  opponent,  you  can 
choose to either use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your 
units die. So, a successful roll of 24 could be used for +4 SL.

Artistic
Max: Dexterity Bonus
Tests: Art (Any)
You have a natural talent for art, able to produce precise sketches 
with  nothing  but  time  and  appropriate  media. This  ability  has 
several  in-game  uses,  ranging  from  creating Wanted  Posters  to 
sketching accurate journals, and has spot benefits as determined 
by  the  GM.  Further  to  this,  add  Art  (Any)  to  any  Career  you 
enter; if it is already in Career, you may instead purchase the Skill 
for 5 XP fewer per Advance.

Attractive
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm Tests to influence those attracted to you
Whether it’s your piercing eyes, your strong frame, or maybe the 

way you flash your perfect teeth, you know how to make the best 
use of what the gods gave you. When you successfully use Charm 
to influence those attracted to you, you can choose to either use 
your  rolled  SL,  or  the  number  rolled  on  your  units  die.  So,  a 
successful roll of 38 could be used for +8 SL.

Battle Rage
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Melee Tests when Frenzied
You are better able to control your Frenzy in combat. You can end 
your Frenzy with a successful Cool Test at the end of the round.

Beat Blade
Max: Weapon Skill Bonus
Tests: Melee for a Beat Blade
You  are  trained  to  make  sharp  controlled  blows  to  your 
opponent’s weapon, creating an opening for an attack or simply 
impeding an incoming attack.  For your Action, you can choose 
to Beat Blade before rolling. Perform a Melee Test; if successful, 
your opponent loses –1 Advantage, and loses a further –1 per 
SL you score. This Test is not Opposed. This Talent is of no use 
if your opponent has no weapon, or has a larger Size than you 
(see page 341).

Beneath Notice
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Stealth when in plain sight
The high and mighty pay no attention to your presence, knowing 
you  are  well  beneath  their  notice.  Assuming  you  are  properly 
attired  and  not  in  an  incongruous  position,  those  of  a  higher 
Status  Tier  will  normally  ignore  you  unless  your  presence 
becomes inappropriate, which can make it very easy to listen into 
conversations  you  perhaps  shouldn’t.  Further,  characters  with  a 
higher  Status Tier  than  you  gain  no  Advantage  for  striking  or 
wounding  you  in  combat,  as  there  is  nothing  to  be  gained  for 
defeating such a lowly cur.

Berserk Charge
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Melee on a Round when you Charge
You hurl yourself at your enemies with reckless abandon, using 
the force of your charge to add weight to your strikes. When you 
Charge, you gain +1 Damage to all Melee attacks per level in this 
Talent.

Blather
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm to Blather
Called  ‘opening  your  mouth  and  letting  your  belly  rumble’  in 
Nordland, or simply ‘bullshitting’ in Ostland, blathering involves 
talking rapidly and incessantly, or talking volubly and at-length, 
about inconsequential or nonsense matters, and is used to verbally 
confuse  and  confound  a  target.  You  use  your  Charm  Skill  to 
Blather. Attempt an Opposed Charm/Intelligence Test. Success 
gives  your  opponent  a Stunned  Condition.  Further,  for  each 
level you have in Blather, your opponent gains another Stunned 

133

 
 
 
 
IV

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Condition.  Targets Stunned  by  Blather  may  do  nothing  other 
than stare at you dumbfounded as they try to catch-up with or 
understand what you are saying. Once the last Stunned Condition 
comes to an end, the target finally gets a word in, and may not 
be best pleased with you — after all, you have been talking about 
nothing  or  nonsense  for  some  time.  Should  you  stop  talking, 
your opponent immediately loses all Stunned Conditions caused 
by your Blather. Generally, you can only attempt to Blather at a 
character once per scene, or perhaps longer as determined by the 
GM, as the target soon wises up to your antics.

Bless (Divine Lore)
Max: 1
You are watched over by one of the Gods and can empower simple 
prayers. You can now deploy the Blessings of your deity as listed 
in Chapter 7: Religion and Belief. Under normal circumstances, 
you may only ever know one Divine Lore for the Bless Talent..

Bookish
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Test: Research
You  are  as  at  home  in  a  library  as  a  seaman  at  sea  or  a  farmer 
a-farming. When using Research, you may reverse the dice of any 
failed Test if this will score a success.

Break and Enter
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Melee when forcing or breaking inanimate objects
You  are  an  expert  at  quickly  breaking  down  doors  and  forcing 
entry. You may add +1 Damage for each level in this Talent when 
determining damage against inanimate objects such as windows, 
chests, doors, and similar.

Briber
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Bribery
You  are  an  exceedingly  skilled  briber.  The  GM  should  reduce 
the base cost of any required bribe by 10% per level you have in 
Briber, to a minimum of 10% of the original amount.

Cardsharp
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Gamble and Sleight of Hand when playing card games
You  are  used  to  playing,  and  winning,  at  cards,  although  your 
methods may involve a little cheating. When you successfully use 
Gamble or Sleight of Hand when playing cards, you can choose 
to either use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your units 
die. So, a successful roll of 28 could be used for +8 SL. If you play 
a  real  card  game  to  represent  what  is  happening  in-game,  you 
may receive an extra number of cards per deal equal to your level 
in  Cardsharp,  then  discard  down  to  the  appropriate  hand-size 
before each round of play.

Careful Strike
Max: Initiative Bonus
You  are  skilled  at  hitting  your  enemy  exactly  where  you  want  to, 
either at range or in melee. You may modify your Hit Location result 

by up to  +/–10 per time you have this Talent. So, if you had this 
Talent twice and hit location 34, the Right Arm, you could modify 
this down to 14, the Left Arm, or up to 54, the Body (see page 
159).

Carouser
Max: Toughness Bonus
Tests: Charm at Parties, Gossip at Parties, Consume Alcohol
You are a seasoned drinker and know how to party hard. You may 
reverse the dice of any failed Consume Alcohol Test if this will 
score a Success.

Catfall
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Athletics when falling
You are nimble and balanced like a cat, and are able to fall much 
greater  distances  unharmed  than  others  might.  Whenever  you 
fall,  you  attempt  an  Athletics  Test.  If  successful,  reduce  the 
distance fallen by 1 yard, +1 extra yard per +1 SL scored, for the 
purposes of calculating Damage.

Cat-tongued
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm when lying
Like  Ranald  the  Trickster  God,  you  blend  truth  and  lies  as  if 
there were no difference. When using Charm to lie, listeners do 
not get to oppose your Charm with their Intuition to detect if 
there is something fishy in what you say.

Chaos Magic (Lore) 
Max: Number of Spells available in chosen Chaos Magic Lore
By accident or design you have lost a portion of your soul to one 
of the Dark Gods, and can now practice the foul magics of Chaos. 
Your ruinous patron immediately grants you access to a single spell 
from the chosen Lore (most commonly the Nurgle, Slaanesh, or 
Tzeentch  Lores)  and  you  gain  a  Corruption  point  as  the  spell 
infiltrates your mind, never to be forgotten. 

Each time you take this Talent, which always costs 100 XP per time 
instead of the normal cost, you learn another spell from your chosen 
Lore and gain a Corruption point. For more about the available 
spells,  see  Chapter  8:  Magic.  Under  normal  circumstances,  you 
may only ever know one Lore of Chaos Magic.

Combat Aware
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Perception during melee
You are used to scanning the battlefield to make snap decisions 
informed by the shifting tides of war. You may take a Challenging 
(+0)  Perception Test  to  ignore  Surprise,  which  is  modified  by 
circumstance as normal.

Combat Master
Max: Agility Bonus
Your  accumulated  years  of  combat  experience  allow  you  to  keep 
lesser  fighters  at  bay.  For  each  level  in  this Talent,  you  count  as 
one more person for the purposes of determining if one side out-

numbers the other. This Talent only comes into play when you are out-numbered. See page 162 for the rules for out-numbering.Combat ReflexesMax: Initiative BonusYou react like a flash of lightning. Add 10 to your Initiative for each level in this Talent when determining Combat Initiative.Commanding PresenceMax: Fellowship BonusTests: LeadershipYour presence fills others with hushed awe and admiration. Such is your aura of authority, those with a lower Status may not resist your Leadership tests with their Willpower. Of course, enemies are still no more likely to respect or obey you, but the common folk rarely stand against you.ConcoctMax: Intelligence BonusTests: Lore (Apothecary)You are skilled at making potions, philtres, and draughts on the go. You may take one free Crafting Endeavour to use Lore (Apothecary) without need of a Workshop. Other Crafting Endeavours use the normal rules.ContortionistMax: Agility BonusTests: Perform and Agility Tests when contorting helpsYou can bend and manipulate your body in a myriad of seemingly unnatural ways. This allows you to squeeze through unlikely gaps and bend your body in crazy ways, giving benefits determined by the GM, possibly with a successful Agility test. CoolheadedMax: 1You gain a permanent +5 bonus to your starting Willpower Characteristic this does not count towards your Advances.Crack the WhipMax: Dexterity BonusTests: Drive or Ride Tests when Fleeing or RunningYou know how to get the most out of your animals. When an animal you control is Fleeing or Running, it gains +1 Movement if you are using a whip.Craftsman (Trade)Max: Dexterity BonusTests: Trade (any one)You have true creative talent. Add the associated Trade Skill to any Career you enter. If the Trade Skill is already in your Career, you may instead purchase the Skill for 5 XP fewer per Advance.CriminalMax: NoneYou are an active criminal making money from illegal sources, and you’re not always quiet about it. For the purposes of securing money, either when Earning during play or performing an Income Endeavour, refer to the following table:Career LevelBonus Money per time the Talent is taken1+2d10 brass pennies2+1d10 silver shillings3+2d10 silver shillings4 +1 gold crownBecause of your obvious criminal nature, others consider you lower Status than them unless they also have the Criminal Talent, where Status is compared as normal — perhaps you have gang tattoos, look shifty, or are just rough around the edges, it’s your choice. Because of this, local law enforcers are always suspicious of you and suspect your motivations, which only gets worse the more times you have this Talent, with the exact implications determined by the GM. Lawbreakers without the Criminal Talent earn significantly less coin but are not obviously the sort to be breaking the law, so maintain their Status. With GM consent, you may spend XP to remove levels of the Criminal Talent for the same XP it cost to buy.Deadeye ShotMax: 1You always hit an opponent right between the eyes… or wherever else you intended to hit. Instead of reversing the dice to determine which Hit Location is struck with your ranged weapons, you may pick a location.DealmakerMax: Fellowship BonusTests: HaggleYou are a skilled businessman who knows how to close a deal. When using the Haggle skill, you reduce or increase the price of the products by an extra 10%. Note: The GM may put a lower limit on prices here to show a seller refusing to sell below cost.Detect ArtefactMax: Initiative BonusTests: Intuition tests to detect magical artefactsYou are able to sense when magic lies within an artefact. You may attempt an Intuition Test for any magical artefact touched. If successful, you sense the item is magical; further, each SL also provides a specific special rule the item uses, if it has any.  Normally, you may only attempt this Test once per artefact touched.DicemanMax: Intelligence BonusTests: Gamble and Sleight of Hand when playing dice gamesYou are a dicing master, and all claims you cheat are clearly IV

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

wrong. When you successfully use Gamble or Sleight of Hand 
when playing with dice, you can choose to either use your rolled 
SL, or the number rolled on your units die. So, a successful roll of 
06 could be used for +6 SL. If you play any real-life dice games to 
represent in-game dice games, always roll extra dice equal to your 
Diceman level and choose the best results.

Dirty Fighting
Max: Weapon Skill Bonus
Tests: Melee (Brawling)
You have been taught all the dirty tricks of unarmed combat. You 
may choose to cause an extra +1 Damage for each level in Dirty 
Fighting with any successful Melee (Brawling) hit. 

Note:  using  this Talent  will  be  seen  as  cheating  in  any  formal 
bout.

Disarm
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Melee Tests concerning this Talent
You  are  able  to  disarm  an  opponent  with  a  careful  flick  of  the 
wrist  or  a  well-aimed  blow  to  the  hand.  For  your  Action,  you 
may  attempt  an  Opposed  Melee/Melee  test.  If  you  win,  your 
opponent loses a held weapon, which flies 1d10 feet in a random 
direction (with further effects as determined by the GM). If you 
win  by  2  SL,  you  can  determine  how  far  the  weapon  is  flung 
instead  of  rolling  randomly;  if  you  win  by  4  SL,  you  can  also 
choose the direction the weapon goes in; if you win by 6 SL or 
more,  you  can  take  your  opponent’s  weapon  if  you  have  a  free 
hand, plucking it from the air with a flourish. This Talent is of no 
use if your opponent has no weapon, or is a larger Size than you 
(see page 341).

WE’RE DOOMED!
the following are examples of doomings to inspire your own 
creations for the doomed talent:

•  From darkness cometh the raven.
•  Beasts of the field hath eyes for thee.
•  plague and dark disease shall bring thee to thy knees.
•  absence makes thy heart grow weaker.
•  the sword shalt bring no justice, only thine end.
•  The bun! The pastry! The pie! lo, they are Morr’s 

dishes!

•  the drummer beats out thine end.
•  Thine end is not thine end!
•  though shalt sup deep of the cup of corruption.
•  high places bring a low end.

Distract
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Athletics to Distract
You are trained in simple movements to distract or startle your 
opponent, drawing eyes from your true intent. You may use your 
Move to perform a Distraction. This is resolved by an Opposed 
Athletics/Cool  Test.  If  you  win,  your  opponent  can  gain  no 
Advantage until the end of the next Round.

Doomed
Max: 1
At the age of 10, a Priest of Morr called a Doomsayer took you 
aside to foretell your death in an incense-laden, coming-of-age 
ritual called the Dooming. In conjunction with your GM, come up 
with a suitable Dooming. Should your character die in a fashion 
that matches your Dooming, your next character gains a bonus of 
half the total XP your dead character accrued during play.

Drilled
Max: Weapon Skill Bonus
Tests: Melee Tests when beside an ally with Drilled
You have been trained to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with other 
soldiers. If an enemy causes you to lose Advantage when standing 
beside an active ally with the Drilled Talent, you may keep 1 lost 
Advantage for each time you’ve taken the Drilled Talent.

Dual Wielder
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Melee or Ranged when attacking with two weapons
When armed with two weapons, you may attack with both for your 
Action. Roll to hit with the weapon held in your primary hand. 
If you hit, determine Damage as normal, but remember to keep 
your dice roll, as you will use it again. If the first strike hits, once 
it is resolved, the weapon in your secondary hand can then target 
an available opponent of your choice using the same dice roll for 
the first strike, but reversed. So, if you rolled 34 to hit with the first 
weapon, you use 43 to hit with the second. Remember to modify 
this second roll by your off-hand penalty (–20 unless you have the 
Ambidextrous Talent). This second attack is Opposed with a new 
defending roll, and damage for this second strike is calculated as 
normal. The only exception to this is if you roll a Critical for your 
first strike. If this happens, use the roll on the Critical Table to also 
act as the roll for the second attack. So, if you scored a critical to the 
head and rolled 56 on the Critical table for a Major Eye Wound, 
your second attack would then strike out with a to-hit value of 56. 
If you choose to attack with both weapons, all your defensive rolls 
until the start of your next Turn suffer a penalty of –10. You do 
not gain an Advantage when you successfully strike or Wound an 
opponent when Dual Wielding unless both attacks hit.

Embezzle
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Intelligence (Embezzling)
You  are  skilled  at  skimming  money  from  your  employers

employer  (assuming  you  have  one).  If  you  win,  you  skim  2d10 
+  SL  brass  pennies,  1d10  +  SL  silver  shillings,  or  1  +  SL  gold 
crowns (depending upon the size of the business in question, as 
determined by the GM) without being detected. If your employer 
wins  by  6+  SL,  you  gain  the  money,  but  your  embezzling  is 
detected; what then happens is left to the GM. Any other result 
means you have failed to embezzle any money.

Enclosed Fighter
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Dodge in enclosed environments
You  have  learned  to  make  the  most  benefit  out  of  fighting  in 
enclosed spaces. You ignore penalties to Melee caused by confined

Fellowship Tests at the GM’s discretion.

Fast Hands
Max: Dexterity Bonus
Tests: Sleight of Hand, Melee (Brawling) to touch an opponent

Tests if they actively suspect and are looking for your movements.

opponent gain a bonus of +10 × your level in Fast Hands.

Max: Agility Bonus 
Tests: Ranged when making a Fast Shot
If you have a loaded ranged weapon, you can fire it outside the 
normal Initiative Order before any other combatant reacts in the 
following Round. You roll to hit using all the normal modifiers. 
Employing Fast Shot  requires  both  your  Action  and  Move  for 
your upcoming turn, and these will count as having been spent 
when your next turn arrives. If two or more characters use Fast 
Shot, the character who has taken this Talent most goes first. If 
any characters have taken Fast Shot an equal number of times, 
both shots are fired simultaneously, and should both be handled 
at the same time.

attack the same opponent before the end of the next Round, you 
may add the SL of your Feint to your attack roll.

Tests: Intelligence Tests concerning this Talent
You are a master of politics and see conspiracy around every corner. 
Once per session, you may ask the GM one question regarding 
a political situation or entangled web of social connections; the 
GM will perform a secret Intelligence Test and provide you some 
observations regarding the situation based upon your SL.

Sea Legs
Max: Toughness Bonus
Tests: All those taken to resist Sea Sickness
You  are  used  to  the  rolling  motion  of  the  oceans,  and  are  very 
unlikely to get sea sick, even in the worst storms. Under normal 
conditions at sea, you need never Test to see if you become Sea 
Sick. At other times (such as a storm, or a magically induced bout 
of Sea Sickness), you can ignore any penalties to Tests to avoid 
Sea Sickness.

Seasoned Traveller
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Any Lore Test concerning local detail 
You are an inquisitive soul who has travelled far and wide, learning 
all manner of local information. Add Lore (Local) to any Career 

you enter; if it is already in Career, you may purchase the Skill, 
both times — a different Speciality each time, such as Altdorf, 
Vorbergland, or Ubersreik — for 5 XP fewer per Advance. 

Second Sight
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Any Test to detect the Winds of Magic
You can perceive the shifting Winds of Magic that course from 
the  Chaos  Gates  at  the  poles  of  the  world.  You  now  have  the 
Sight (see page 233).

Secret Identity
Max: Intelligence Bonus 
Tests: Entertain (Acting) Tests to support your secret identities
You maintain a secret identity that allows you to appear richer, 
or perhaps poorer, than you actually are. With GM permission, 
choose any one Career. As long as you are dressed appropriately, 
you  may  use  the  Social  Status  of  the  chosen  Career  you 
masquerade as rather than your own for modifying Fellowship 
Tests,  and  can  even  ignore  the  Criminal  Talent.  However, 
maintaining  this  identity  will  require  Entertain  (Acting)  rolls 
when you encounter those who may recognise your falsehood. 
You may create a new Secret Identity for each level you have in 
this Talent.

Shadow
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Any Test involving Shadowing
You  are  skilled  at  following  people  without  being  spotted. You 
may  use  the  Shadowing  rules  on  page  130  without  doing  a 
Combined Test. Instead you test against just your Perception or 
your Stealth Skill, whichever is higher.

Sharp
Max: 1
You  gain  a  permanent  +5  bonus  to  your  starting  Initiative 
Characteristic (this does not count towards your Advances).

Sharpshooter
Max: 1
You  can  make  aimed  shots  of  exceptional  accuracy.  You  ignore 
any negative Difficulty modifiers to Ranged Tests due to the size 
of your target.

Shieldsman
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Any Test to defend with a shield
You  are  skilled  at  using  your  shield  to  manoeuvre  others  in 
combat  so  you  can  take  advantage  of  a  desperate  situation. 
When using a Shield to defend, you gain Advantage equal to 
the  number  of  levels  you  have  in  Shieldsman  if  you  lose  the 
Opposed Test.

Sixth Sense
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Intuition Tests involving your Sixth Sense
You get a strange feeling when you are threatened, and can react 
accordingly.  The  GM  may  warn  you  if  you  are  walking  into 
danger;  this  will  normally  come  after  a  secret  Intuition  Test 
on your behalf. Further, you may ignore Surprise if you pass an 
Intuition Test.

Slayer
Max: 1
When  determining  Damage  use  your  opponent’s  Toughness 
Bonus as your Strength Bonus if it is higher; always determine 
this  before  any  other  rules  modify  your  Strength  or  Strength 
Bonus. Further, if your target is larger than you, and your score a 
Critical (see page 159), multiply all melee Damage you cause by 
the number of steps larger your target is (so, 2 steps = ×2, 3 steps = 
×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers 
are applied. See page 341 for more about Size.

Small
Max: 1
You are much shorter than most folk in the Old World. The full 
rules  for  different  Sizes  are  found  in  Chapter  12:  Bestiary  on 
page 341.

Sniper
Max: 4
Tests: Ranged (Long–Extreme Range)
Distance is of no import to your shooting skills, and you are just 
as adept at picking off far away targets as those nearby. You suffer 
no penalties for shooting at Long range, and half the penalties 
for Extreme range.

Speedreader
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Research and Language Tests where speed of reading is 
important
You  read  books  at  a  voracious  pace.  You  may  reverse  a  failed 
Research Test if this will grant success. If the speed at which you 
read is important during combat, a successful Language Test lets 
you  read  and  fully  comprehend  a  number  of  pages  per  Round 
equal to your SL plus Speedreader level (minimum of 1, even if 
you fail the Test).

Sprinter
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Athletics Tests concerning Running
You  are  a  swift  runner.  Your  Movement  Attribute  counts  as  1 
higher when Running.

Step Aside
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Dodge Tests to activate this Talent
You  are  skilled  at  being  where  enemy  weapons  are  not.  If  you 
use  Dodge  to  defend  against  an  incoming  attack  and  win  the 
Opposed Test, you may move up to 2 yards as you dive away, and 
no longer count as Engaged. None of your opponents will gain a 
Free Attack when you do this.

Stone Soup
Max: Toughness Bonus
Tests: Endurance Tests to resist hunger
You  are  used  to  getting  by  with  less,  and  know  how  to  survive 
lean times. You can subsist on half the amount of food required 
without  any  negative  penalties  (bar  feeling really  hungry),  and 
need only test for Starvation every 3 days, not 2 (see page 181).

Stout-hearted
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Cool Tests to remove Broken Conditions
No  matter  how  bad  things  get,  you  always  seem  to  come  back 
for  more.  You  may  attempt  a  Cool  Test  to  remove  a Broken 
Condition at the end of each of your Turns as well as at the end 
of the Round (see page 168 for more on this).

Strider (Terrain)
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Athletics Tests to traverse the Terrain
You are experienced in traversing difficult ground. You ignore all 
movement  penalties  when  crossing  over  or  through  a  specified 
terrain.  Typical  specialities  include:  Coastal,  Deserts,  Marshes, 
Rocky, Tundra, Woodlands.

Strike Mighty Blow
Max: Strength Bonus
You know how to hit hard! You deal your level of Strike Mighty 
Blow in extra Damage with melee weapons.

when you cause a Critical Wound.

Strike to Stun

You know where to hit an opponent to bring him down fast. You 
ignore the ‘Called Shot’ penalty to strike the Head Hit Location

298).  Further,  you  count  all  improvised  weapons  as  having  the 
Pummel Quality. 

Strong Back
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Row and Swim
You have a strong back that is used to hard work. You may add 
your levels in Strong Back to your SL in any Opposed Strength 
Tests, and can carry additional Encumbrance points of trappings 
(see page 293) equal to your level of Strong Back.

Strong Legs
Max: Strength Bonus
You have strong legs able to carry you great distances when you 
jump.  Add  your  Strong  Legs  level  to  your  SL  in  any  Athletics 
Tests involving Leaping (see page 166).

Strong-minded
Max: Willpower Bonus
You are the epitome of determination and resolve. Add your level 
in Strong Minded to your maximum Resolve pool. 

Strong Swimmer
Max: Strength Bonus

Strong Swimmer to your Toughness Bonus for the purposes of 
holding your breath.

Sturdy
Max: Strength Bonus
Tests: Strength Tests when lifting
You have a brawny physique, or are very used to carrying things. 
Increase  the  number  of  Encumbrance  Points  you  can  carry  by 
your Sturdy level x 2.

Suave
Max: 1
You  gain  a  permanent  +5  bonus  to  your  starting  Fellowship 
Characteristic (this does not count towards your Advances).

Super Numerate
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Evaluate, Gamble
You have a gift for calculation and can work out the solution to most 
mathematical problems with ease. You may use a simple calculator 
to represent what your PC is capable of mentally computing.

Supportive
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Social Tests to influence a superior
You  know  what  to  say  and  when  to  make  the  most  impact 
upon your superiors. When you successfully use a social Skill to 
influence those with a higher Status tier, you can choose to either 
use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your units die. So, a 
successful roll of 46 could be used for +6 SL.

Sure Shot
Max: Initiative Bonus
You know how to find the weak spots in a target’s armour. When 
you hit a target with a Ranged weapon, you may ignore Armour 
Points equal to your Sure Shot level.

Surgery
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Heal Tests outside combat rounds; i.e. when you have 
time to do it ‘properly’
You  are a surgeon, able to open and  close  the  flesh  in order to 
heal others. You can treat any Critical Wound marked as needing 
Surgery. You can also perform surgery to resolve internal issues 
with  an  Extended  Challenging  (+0)  Heal  Test  with  a  target 
SL determined by the GM (usually 5–10) depending upon the 
difficulty of the procedure at hand. This will cause 1d10 Wounds 
and 1 Bleeding Condition per Test, meaning surgery has a high 
chance  of  killing  a  patient  if  the  surgeon  is  not  careful.  After 
surgery, the patient must pass an Average (+20) Endurance Test 
or gain a Minor Infection (see page 187).

Tenacious
Max: Toughness Bonus
Tests: Endurance Tests for enduring hardships
You never give up, no matter how impossible your travails appear. 
You  can  double  the  length  of  time  successful  Endurance Tests 
allow you to endure a hardship. This includes enduring prolonged 
riding, exposure, rituals, and similar adversities.

Tinker
Max: Dexterity Bonus
Tests: Trade Tests to repair broken items
You are somewhat of a Johann-of-all-trades, able to repair almost 
anything. You count all non-magical Trade Skills as Basic when 
repairing broken items.

Tower of Memories
Max: Intelligence Bonus
A  recollection  technique  first  instigated  by  the  Cult  of Verena, 
reputedly  from  Elven  practices  taught  by  the  Loremasters 
of  Hoeth,  Tower  of  Memories  allows  you  to  perfectly  recall  a 

146

s K I l l s   a n d   ta l e n t s

sequence of facts by storing them in an imaginary spire. You can 
recall a sequence as long as your Intelligence without having to 
make a Test. For every 10 more items you attempt to memorise, 
you  must  make  an  increasingly  difficult  Intelligence  Test  to 
recall the list correctly, starting at Very Easy (+60) for +10, Easy 
(+40)  for  +20,  Average  (+20)  for  +30,  and  so  on.  Beyond  it’s 
obvious utility for Gamble Tests, where having this Talent adds 
a  bonus  of  +20  to  +60  depending  upon  how  useful  recalling 
sequences is to the game at hand, the GM can apply bonuses 
to  other Tests  as  appropriate.  Each  time  you  take  this Talent 
you  may  recall  an  extra  sequence  without  having  to  forget  a 
previously stored one.

Trapper
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Perception Tests to spot traps, Set Trap
You  are  skilled  at  spotting  and  using  traps.  You  may  take  a 
Perception Test to spot traps automatically without having to tell 
the GM of your intention; the GM may prefer to make some of 
these Tests on your behalf in private.

Trick Riding
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Dodge Tests on Horseback, Ride (Horse)
You  are  capable  of  amazing  feats  of  agility  on  horseback.  You 
can use any of your Performer Skills and unmodified Dodge skill 
when on horseback. Further, when mounted, you can make your 
Move at the start of the Round instead of on your Turn. 

Tunnel Rat
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Stealth Tests when underground
You  are  at  home  in  tunnels,  sewers,  and  other  underground 
environments. When using Stealth in an underground environment, 
bystanders do not get passive Perception Tests to detect you; they 
can only spot you if they are specifically on look-out, or watching 
for hidden others.

Unshakable
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Cool Tests to resist Blackpowder panic
You  are  a  jaded  veteran  who  has  survived  more  than  one  hail 
of shots from Blackpowder weapons. You need only take a Cool 
Test to resist a Broken Condition if you are successfully wounded 
by a Blackpowder weapon, not just if you are shot at.

Very Resilient
Max: 1
You  gain  a  permanent  +5  bonus  to  your  starting  Toughness 
Characteristic (this does not count towards your Advances).

Very Strong
Max: 1
You  gain  a  permanent  +5  bonus  to  your  starting  Strength 
Characteristic (this does not count towards your Advances). 

War Leader
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Skills: Leadership Tests during War
Your  stern  gaze  and  inspiring  words  motivate  your  soldiers  to 
fight  on  to  the  end.  All  subordinates  able  to  see  you  may  add 
your level in War Leader to their SL in one Willpower Test per 
Round. This bonus does not stack.

War Wizard
Max: 1
You are trained to cast magic while in the thick of combat. On 
your Turn, you may cast one Spell with a Casting Number of 5 or 
less for free without using your Action. However, if you do this, 
you may not cast another spell this Turn.

Warrior Born
Max: 1
You  gain  a  permanent  +5  bonus  to  your  starting Weapon  Skill 
Characteristic (doesn’t count as Advances).

Waterman
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Sail Tests for river-going vessels
You are an experienced freshwater sailor and are well-versed with 
river  vessels.  You  can  ignore  all  negatives  to  your  Tests  when 
onboard  a  barge  derived  from  rolling  waters,  swaying  vessels, 
unsure footing, and similar. Further, you count as two boatmen 
towards the minimum number of crew to pilot a river vessel.

Wealthy
Max: None
You  are  fabulously  wealthy,  and  are  rarely  ever  short  of  coin. 
When  Earning  (including Income  Endeavours)  you  secure  +1 
GC per time you have this Talent.

Well-prepared
Max: Initiative Bonus
You are used to anticipating the needs of others, and yourself. A 
number of times per session equal to your level of Well-Prepared, 
you may pull the trapping required for the current situation from 
your backpack (or similar) as long as it is Encumbrance 0, could 
feasibly been bought recently, and doesn’t stretch credibility too far. 
This could be anything from a flask of spirits to fortify a wounded 
comrade  to  a  pfennig-whistle  needed  by  a  passing  entertainer. 
Whenever you do this, you must deduct the cost for the prepared 
item from your purse, representing the coin you spent earlier.

Witch!
Max: Willpower Bonus
You  have  learned  magic  through  trial  and  error.  Add  Language 
(Magick) to any Career you enter; if it is already in your Career, you 
may purchase the Skill for 5 XP fewer per Advance. Further, you 
may spend 1 Resilience point to immediately cast any spell as if it 
were one of your Arcane Lore spells; you also instantly memorise 
that spell as one of your Arcane Lore spells for 0 XP. You can do 
this a number of times equal to your level in this Talent.

rules

•

The game is afoot; grim and perilous. The players lean forward in 
their seats, listening intently to the GM describing the plot as it 
unfolds, excitedly explaining their characters’ actions in response 
and breathlessly waiting to hear what happens next…

At the core of the rules are Tests — rolls of the dice that determine 
outcomes. There  are  also  additional  rules  for  more  complex  or 
unusual tasks – see the box for a handy list with page references. 
The GM should be familiar with these, but as a player you’ll be 
fine so long as you know the basics of the different kinds of Test. 

Roleplaying games often work best with minimal interruptions 
to  this  narrative  flow  —  the  smoother  the  game  proceeds,  the 
more  involved  everyone  will  be.  However,  as  the  adventure 
develops, situations will arise where the outcome of a character’s 
action is uncertain. Maybe a character leaps from a wall to hack 
down a pillaging Goblin — will they land poised for action or 
flat on their face?

Sometimes, especially with events that don’t affect the players too 
much, the GM can simply decide the outcome and relate it to 
the  group.  However,  if  the  success  or  failure  of  the  action  has 
significant impact on the players, it is more tense and dramatic 
to roll some dice and let the fates and a character’s capabilities 
determine whether they succeed or fail.  Using the game rules also 
lets players assess their chances and make decisions accordingly 
— it’s a fair and transparent way to resolve things.

churning  stream?  Can  Wilhelm  charm  a  lower  price  from  the 
truculent  merchant?  Often,  a  quick  yes  or  no  answer  to  these 
questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly. The exception 
to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress 
of the adventure, in which case you should use a Dramatic Test 
(see page 152) instead.

To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 (see Throwing Bones on 
page 6) and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic 
best suited to the action you are attempting. 

Note this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or 
hard to complete (see Difficulty on page 153).

If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s 
outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task.

If  you  roll  higher  than  the  Skill  or  Characteristic,  the  Test’s 
outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task.

Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should 
describe  what  just  happened  so  everyone  understands  how  the 
Test has impacted the story.

Example: Molli runs across Altdorf’s Königsplatz on a cold, 
winter’s night. The cobbles are blanketed in thick snow hiding 
treacherous ice beneath, but with a gang of thugs in eager 
pursuit Molli is not about to slacken her pace. The GM calls 
for a Simple Athletics Test to see if Molli can cross the slippery 
platz safely. Molli’s Athletics is 42, and her player rolls d100 
scoring a 17. As 17 is below Molli’s Athletics of 42, the result is 
a success, so the answer is yes, Molli can cross without mishap. 
The GM says that Molli crosses the open snow and darts into 
the relative safety of one of the many dark alleyways at the other 
side. If her player had rolled over 42, Molli would have slipped, 
and the thugs would have been upon her!

talents and tests
some  talents  can  improve  a  test’s  chances  of  success,  or 
grant  you  access  to  unique  tests  allowing  you  to  attempt 
extraordinary feats. For more details regarding this, refer to 
talents on page 132.

the Golden rule
the  rules  exist  to  help  you  enjoy  epic  stories  in  the 
Warhammer world, so they should never be a barrier to having 
fun. arguably, the most important rule in this book is:

if  a  rule  negatively  impacts  fun  for  your  group,  change  it  or 
ignore it.

This rule is so important, you will find alternative and optional 
rules throughout this book to support building a ruleset that 
best suits your group and your style of play. If it’s your first 
game, ignore these until you become more familiar with how 
it all works, and you can experiment with some of the variants 
as the mood takes you.

Be careful not to confuse ‘fun’ with ‘always succeeding’ — a 
sense of risk and the real possibility of failure is an important 
part of drama. things going wrong provides players with the 
challenge of recovering from setbacks, a central part of any 
hero’s journey.

teStS

‘aye, there are times when things just go wrong. really, badly wrong. 
like that time half way up the Bögen when olaf jumped into a tree 
but missed and hit that jagged branch square on. I think he’s there 
still, although there’s probably not much of him left after the animals 
had a season’s grazing. By sigmar’s grace, sit yourself down and have 
some cheese, there’s nothing good for you out there!’

– dieter Käsegeier, cheesemonger, ex-adventurer

When your character takes an action, the GM will let you know 
what happens next. Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on 
your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved 
what you were attempting, or that you didn’t. If the GM isn’t sure 
of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they 
can resolve the action using the rules. There are a few options, as 
the Using Tests box shows. Tests compare a dice roll to one of 
the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide 
an outcome.

Simple  Tests  are  used  when  you  need  to  determine  if  your 
character succeeds or fails at a simple task. Does Molli leap the

No matter how skilled or talented a character  is, there  is always 
a chance of failure. Equally, there is always a chance of success in 
WFRP, no matter the odds stacked against you. 

If  you  roll  96–00  on  any  Test,  it  is always  a  failure.  A  failure 
occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher. 
Similarly,  if  you  roll  01–05  on  a Test,  it  is always  a  success.  A 
success occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is less 
than 01–05.

optIons: autosuccess? 
nOT AT My TABlE!
not everybody likes a 5% chance of auto-success on any test. 
similarly, not everyone likes the same chance of auto-failures. 
If this describes you, then simply change the numbers to your 
taste.  the  most  common  alternative  is  96–00  always  fails, 
and 01 always succeeds.

von meInKopF’s preemInent 
proBaBIlIty paraphernalIa
the rules use a selection of mechanics to modify or manipulate 
percentile rolls. the following explains these in detail:

Rolling a double: rolling a double means both the tens and the 
units die of a percentile test have rolled the same number. For 
example: 11, 22, 33, 44 and so on.
Reroll: a reroll is when you disregard the result of a dice roll, and 
roll it again. once a test has been rerolled, it cannot be rerolled 
again under normal circumstances.
Reverse: to reverse a percentile roll, you swap the tens result with 
the units result. so, a roll of 58 becomes 85, or a roll of 51 
becomes 15. obviously, if you roll a double, it will have the same 
result when reversed, so 77 reverses to 77.
Modifiers: these numbers are added or subtracted to the one of 
your Skill to make the Test easier or more difficult. This is most 
often referred to as the Difficulty of the roll (see page 153). 

If you want to introduce some test-specific outcomes for particularly 
dramatic moments, you can use the methods above as a toolkit.

Great Game rules

V

Game rules establish a mutually agreed and understood foundation for how WFRP works. they are important as they keep 
things fair and demonstrate the setting’s internal logic. But having the best game experiences depends on your interactions with 
the other players, too. here are some points to consider to help make your games the best they can be:

everyone’s invited to the fun: Be welcoming to new or inexperienced players.

off-limits: respect people who don’t want sex/violence/horror or other uncomfortable topics in the game, and accept they don’t 
have to justify why. there are many very good (potentially traumatic) reasons.

consideration: nobody’s fun should come at another’s expense.

table manners: discuss what’s oK and not oK at the game table. eating, use of electronic devices, drinking alcohol, texting, 
using social media? all of these and more are all worth discussing before play.

involve others: don’t try to hog every scene, give everyone time in the spotlight.

teamwork: don’t be needlessly awkward or make your character wander off alone without good reason, (splitting the group 
slows down play).

Respect your gm: let the Gm worry about the rules — rules arguments are a fun killer (and you can always discuss it with 
the Gm after the game).

contribute: your actions should help progress the story and develop your character.

Play the game: It’s not always about winning, it’s about the stories you tell and the fun you have. sometimes your character 
might die, accept that, and, if it happens, make it memorable and fun. Also remember, sometimes, it’s just better to run away! 

good mentors: If you have younger players in your group, it is everyone’s responsibility to welcome, help, and maintain age-
appropriate behaviour.

optIons: tests aBove 100%
Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested. 
If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure.

a successful test gains a bonus of +1 sl for each full 10% a tested characteristic or skill exceeds 100%.

example: countess emmanuelle von liebwitz has a charm skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her charm 
advances of +35% (see Advances on page 47 for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a charm test, she gains a bonus of +1 
sl over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable talents.

dRamaTiC TesTs
Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes, 
it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a 
Test. This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against 
another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic 
and  combat.  So,  when  you  want  to  know  exactly  how  well  or 
badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test.  Another 
reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the 
adventure  could  depend  on  the  Test.  Dramatic  Tests  provide 
outcomes  rather  than  straight  success  or  failure,  which  means 
that  even  if  the  test  is  ‘failed’  the  adventure  continues,  albeit 
in  a  more  challenging  way  than  if  you  had  achieved  a  success. 
Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and 
still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have 
more detail. This detail is governed by Success Levels. 

Success Levels
Success  Levels  (shortened  to  SL)  are  used  to  describe  the 
effectiveness of a Test. To determine the SL of a Test, subtract 
the 10s number of the rolled dice from  the  10s  number  of  the 
Characteristic  or  Skill  being  tested,  including  any  modifiers 
(see  Difficulty  for  more  on  modifiers). The  higher  the  SL,  the 
better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone. 
Marginal  results,  where  you  succeed  or  fail  a  Test  with  +0  or 
–0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a 
whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could 
give inconclusive results allowing you try again. 

Example: Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his 
stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when 
a wall blocks his passage. He decides to push his mount to jump, 
and the GM calls for a Dramatic Ride (Horse) test. Eichengard 
rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41. The 10s number of 

the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so 
the test succeeds with +2 SL (4–2=2) and he clears the wall with 
space to spare. Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around 
in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at 
the horsemen pursuing him. Unfortunately, this means he’s 
not paying attention to where he’s going. The GM calls for a 
Dramatic Perception Test, and Eichengard’s player rolls 82, 
significantly higher than Eichengard’s Perception skill of 39. 
The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill 
being tested is 3, so the test has failed with –5 SL (3–8=–5). He 
has failed rather badly. As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly 
distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams 
hard into his side, knocking him flying. 

optIons: Fast sl
determining your sl involves some simple mathematics, so 
calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes. Fortunately, 
there is a fast way to calculate sl for those looking to keep 
their games as fast as possible. When you pass a test, use 
the result of the tens die as your sl. so, if you passed a 
test with a roll of 36, you score +3 sl. With this optional 
rule, the closer you roll to your tested skill, the better, rather 
than rolling low being best. If a test fails, you calculate sl 
as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested skill 
to determine your negative sl.

Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just happened. Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to ‘do I succeed at this test?’, dramatic tests also provide answers, just more of them.If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01–05 (see page 150), you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher.If you automatically fail due to rolling 96–00 (see page 150), you score –1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower.  OptiOns: CritiCals & FumblesWe introduce some extra rules for Criticals and Fumbles in Combat later in this chapter. they can also be used to add drama for all tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as extreme results become commonplace. if that describes your group, you could use the following optional rule.any test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a Critical, meaning you’ve scored an astounding success from the Outcome table; and any failure including a double is a Fumble, resulting in an astounding Failure from the Outcome table. this optional rule works well with simple tests, providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there.CharaCteristiC testssometimes you may want to do something that is not covered by one of the skills. in these rare cases, you make a Characteristic test instead of a skill test. the Gm determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you are attempting, and you test it as normal.DifficultyNot all Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is laughably easy but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough. To represent this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the Difficulty. While published adventures define the difficulty for the GM — for example: calling for a Hard (–20) Research test — there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the fly. Making judgments like this is one of the most common functions of the GM. For each Test, whether simple or dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extreme situations. Example: Valentyn, a Jade Wizard, tries to find the tracks of an unruly stag he is hunting. Under normal circumstances, he would perform an Average (+20) Track Test with his skill of 41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very Hard and imposes a –30 penalty. Therefore, Valentyn has to roll 11 or under (41–30=11) to succeed. He rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade Wizard’s attempt.DiFFiCulty tableDifficultyTest ModifierVery Easy+60Easy+40Average+20Challengingno modifierDifficult-10Hard-20Very Hard-30Opposed TestsSometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of an opponent. The rules represent this with a special Dramatic Test called an Opposed Test. Opposed Tests are an important part of WFRP’s combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in many other situations, as well.An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test, but both parties make a Test. The party with the highest SL wins the Test. If both participants score the same SL, the party with the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins. In the unlikely V

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by 
the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2) 
both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner.

Example:  Having floored an important Reiklander baron 
at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however, 
some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they 
really should detain the noble captain. Salundra scowls as she 
approaches. 

The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the 
guardsmen’s commanding officer’s Leadership Test. Both the 
player and the GM roll. Salundra’s Intimidate is 47. The officer’s 
Leadership is 46. Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4–0=4), 
while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4–1=3). As Salundra’s SL 
is higher (4 to the officer’s 3), she successfully intimidates the 
guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble.

Like  any  other Tests,  some  Opposed Tests  are  easier  or  harder 
than  others,  so  the  GM  may  decide  modifiers  are  required.  In 
most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but 
not always. If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is 
assumed to be Challenging (+0). 

If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed 
Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine 
a final SL.

Example:  It’s  Pie Week,  an  annual  week-long  festival  for 
everyone’s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pie-
eating contest. She’s reached the final, and it’s her versus Fat Tom 
Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5 
years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall. 

The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test. Salundra has 
an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63. Salundra is possibly 
in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring –1 SL. Sali’s 
looking a little green! But Fat Tom’s looking worse! He rolls 91 
for –3 SL. So, even though she’s failed her Endurance roll, she 
still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she’ll probably be 
bringing up most of those pies later!

Extended Tests
Sometimes  the  adventure  will  call  for  a  specific  number  of 
Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming 
or especially taxing task. Doing this requires a special Dramatic 
Test called an Extended Test. Extended Tests are handled in the 
same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from 
multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target. If the 
total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch 
with the next roll.

Example: On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an 
unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered. The GM states 
the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a Challenging (+0) Pick 
Lock Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before 
the guard arrives. Molli’s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good 
chance of managing it, but time isn’t on her side. Unfortunately for 
her, her first Test scores 63: –1 SL and a terrible start, she’s made no 
progress and will start from scratch next round.  Cursing under her 
breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring 
11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost 
springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer. 

The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard 
arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the 
guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs 

r u l e s

V

to pick the lock. Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last 
Test and rolls, scoring… 42! That’s +1 SL, taking her to a total of 
5. The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through 
the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives.

of 69 (59–10+20=69). However, he rolls 74, and fails, meaning 
all three characters have failed to find anything useful before the 
hobbling merchant returns.

optIons: comBInInG sKIlls
sometimes,  you  may  be  in  a  situation  where  you  feel  two 
skills should be tested by the same character for a single task, 
so it may be appropriate to combine those skills for a single 
test. there are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster 
and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with 
the game; 2) having to pass two tests in a row to perform a 
single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall.

the simplest way to do this is to attempt both skills with one 
test, comparing a single percentile roll to each skill number. 
If both pass, you succeed at the test. If only one passes, you 
partially pass as appropriate. and, obviously, if both fail, you 
have failed the test. 

example: After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself 
on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the 
vargr Breughel memorial playhouse’s inaugural production 
of ‘tell me on a Festag’. the Gm calls for a challenging 
combined Perform (dance) and entertain (Sing) test, thinking 
it unfair salundra should have to enact each test in turn as 
that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success. 
salundra has perform (dance) at 53 from her time in court, 
but doesn’t have entertain (sing), so must use her Fellowship 
of 43. she then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance 
(succeeded with +1 sl), but hit a few off-notes with her 
singing (failed at -0 sl) — not perfect, but good enough 
for the gathered crowds; though Kym neumann, the altdorf 
spieler’s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review...

optIons:
extended tests and 0 sl
Rolling 0 Sl in an Extended Test does not benefit or hinder 
the running sl total, which can feel a little odd given you 
either passed or failed the test, and that should perhaps come 
with some advantage or penalty. If this is an issue for you, use 
the following optional rule. a successful test adds a minimum 
of +1 sl to the cumulative total, and a failed test removes a 
minimum of –1 sl from the total.

assisTanCe
In some situations, multiple Characters working together have a 
better chance of completing a task than a Character attempting it 
alone. With the GM’s permission, a Character can assist another 
Character  who  is  about  to  take  a  Test.  When  doing  so,  the 
Character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice. 

Each  Character  assisting  provides  a  bonus  of  +10  to  the Test. 
Other than that, the Test is rolled as normal.

Limits on Assistance
Characters  can  assist  each  other  in  most  tasks;  however,  there 
are limits.

•	

To assist you require at least 1 Advance in the Skill being 
tested.

•	 Assisting  Characters  must  normally  be  adjacent  to  the 

Character taking the Test.

•	

•	

You may not assist on Tests made to resist disease, poison, 
fear, hazards, or anything else the GM deems inappropriate.

You may not be assisted by more Characters than you have 
in the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (see page 33).

Example: Adhemar, Perdita, and Valentyn hastily search a room 
when its owner, an aging merchant, leaves to find some records. 
The GM declares a Difficult (–10) Perception Test is required. 
Since Perdita and Valentyn both have the Perception Skill and are 
helping, Adhemar (who has the highest Perception Skill, at 59) 
gains a bonus of +20 to his Perception Test, for a combined total

Sooner  or  later  you  will  need  to  stop  someone  in  their  tracks, 
or  someone  will  try  to  stop  you.  When  diplomacy  fails,  is  not 
attempted,  or  is  not  understood  as  a  basic  concept,  Combat 
begins!

In  Combat,  lots  of  individuals  take  actions  in  a  short  space  of 
time, many of them in direct opposition to each other. You will 
still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host 
of other factors become more important, so we have some rules 
to make everything work.

Timing
In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is 
organised into:

•	

Rounds: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt 
a Test and move into position. It’s normally a just few seconds, 
the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary.

•	 Turns:  During  a  Round,  each  combatant  has  a  Turn  to 

•	

perform an Action and a Move.
Initiative Order: Each combatant usually takes their Turn 
in  order  of  their  Initiative  Characteristic,  from  highest  to 
lowest.

ComBaT sUmmaRy
Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:

1.  Determine Surprise: The GM determines if any characters 
are Surprised. This normally only happens on the first round 
of combat. See the section below. 

2.  Round Begins: If the rules call for something to happen at 

the start of the Round, it happens now.

3.  Characters Take Turns:  Each  combatant  takes  a Turn  in 
Initiative  order,  starting  with  the  highest  Initiative.  Each 
Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on 
their Turn (see page 157).

4.  Round Ends: The  Round  ends  when  all  combatants  have 
taken a Turn. If the rules call for something to happen at the 
end of the Round, it happens now.

they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they 
also  have  the  same  Agility,  then  roll  an  Opposed Agility Test, 
with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat. Some 
Talents impact combat order (see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents).
Example: Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of 
his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33. If they attack 
a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order 
would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33).

ROll FOR InITIATIvE!
some groups prefer to randomise Initiative. there are several 
ways to do this, choose your favourite:

•  each character rolls an Initiative test to determine a 

sl.

•  each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative.
•  each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their agility 

Bonus + Initiative Bonus.

the Gm notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses 
this as the Initiative order. you could use this order for every 
round (quickest option) or roll each round (gives some variety to 
the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last).

rounds outsIde comBat
out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually 
flexible.  Sometimes  it  is  helpful  to  use  Rounds  outside  of 
combat  to  help  organise  everyone’s  contributions;  for 
example, extended tests happen over several rounds, with one 
test taken each round. (see page 154). 

5.  Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required: Continue to play through 

Rounds until the combat is resolved.

sURpRise

iniTiaTive oRdeR
Combatants  act  in  Initiative  order  during  the  Round,  with  the 
highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn. 
If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in 
Initiative order. If multiple combatants have the same Initiative, 

Taking  your  enemy  by  surprise  gives  you  a  big  advantage.  If 
one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the 
element of surprise by:

•	 Hiding: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover. 
Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they 
are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous.

156

r u l e s

V

•	

Sneaky Tactics: Attack from behind, in the dark, through 
heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception 
Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate.

•	

•	 Distractions: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially 
engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could 
harbour a surprise attack! 
Unprepared  Defenders:  If  the  enemy  are  particularly 
unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims.
Something  Else:  Other  sneaky  and 
ingenious  plans 
concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call 
on the possibility of surprise.

•	

SURPRISE TAlEnTS!
even in situations where the Gm states there is no chance of 
spotting incoming ambushers, some talents allow surprise to 
be avoided. see chapter 4: Skill and talents for more on this.

example: tollich and perdita fall foul of an ambush by gore-
smeared cultists of the Blood God. the combat begins when 
the cultists storm from their hiding places, revealing their 
positions. the Gm decides tollich and perdita are surprised 
as they were having a vigorous debate, and neither was at all 
prepared for an ambush. however, tollich has the combat 
aware talent, which grants a challenging (+0) Perception test 
to avoid surprise; for tollich, this is 41. he rolls 23, showing 
his well-honed instincts have spotted something is wrong. so, 
for the first round, only Perdita takes the surprised condition; 
tollich and the cultists act as normal.

If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM  will 
typically call for Opposed Stealth vs Perception Test, usually 
with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential 
spotters.  If  the  ambusher  wins,  each  defeated  character  gains 
the Surprised Condition (see page 169). 

If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal.

If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the 
Surprised Condition (see page 169).

Taking yoUR TURn
Combat is a dynamic, disorientating experience, with friend and 
foe  desperately  weaving  around  each  other,  blades  flashing  as 
thrust follows parry follows gunshot. 

The GM describes the situation — where everyone is, what your 
surroundings are like — and you can ask for more details to flesh 
things out and help plan your action. ‘How thick is the chandelier 
rope? Could an arrow cut it?’, for example. When it’s your Turn, 
you’ll make your Move and take Action! 

On  your  Turn  you  have  a  Move  and  an  Action,  you  can  take 
these in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at 
the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined 
manoeuvre. You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though 
you won’t get another opportunity until the next Round!

Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life. 
Rather than declare your action is, ‘hit the Goblin’, it’s much more 
fun  to  say, ‘I  Kick  the  chair  in  front  of  me  towards  the  Goblins 
and  lunge  with  my  sword  at  the  closest  one’s  throat’. You  never 
know,  the  GM  might  reward  you  with  the  odd  bonus  for  great 
roleplaying. This goes for the resolution of your Action too — the 
GM will describe the outcome, but you can certainly embellish it! 

 
V

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Move
In  most  circumstances,  exact  distances  don’t  matter  too  much. 
Use  your  Movement  Characteristic  as  a  guide  to  the  ground 
you can cover, and the GM will let you know if  the  move will 
take more than one Turn. Reaching difficult places, perhaps by 
climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test 
a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test).

If  you  are  not  already  fighting  someone,  you  can  also  use  your 
Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage (see 
page  164).  For  more  on  this,  and  for  a  detailed  breakdown  of 
movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see Moving on 
page 164.

or be hit by the table. Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and 
the table lands squarely on her head…

Free Actions
Some things you’ll want your Character to do won’t count as your 
Action  for  the  round  —  such  as  shouting  a  warning,    drawing 
your  weapon,  or  drinking  a  potion.  It’s  the  GM’s  decision  on 
what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round. A 
good general guide is that if an act requires you to make a Test, it 
is an Action rather than a Free Action. 

Action
In combat, your Action is used to do something. Whether that’s 
swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take 
a moment to gauge the situation, that’s up to you. Your Action is 
only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the 
fight location and the capabilities of your Character.

Describe what you want your Character to do. The GM will then 
tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned 
Action. The  results  will  then  be  narrated  by  you  and  the  GM, 
ending your Action.

For  a  detailed  breakdown  of  how  to  use  your  Action  to  attack 
another Character, refer to Attacking. If you would like to use 
prayers or magic, refer to either Chapter 7: Religion and Belief 
or Chapter 8: Magic. Chapter 4: Skills and Talents also contains 
many examples of how to use your Skills during combat.

Example: Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as 
Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to 
put the young captain in her place. On her Turn, Molli’s player 
asks if the pub has an upper floor. The GM confirms it does, and 
that it has a balcony overlooking the fight. Smiling, the player 
declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on 
the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action. 
Given the upper floor isn’t far away, the GM decides Molli can 
get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there 
will take a little effort. 

The GM calls for an Average (+20) Athletics Test to heft the table 
over the balcony. Molli’s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or 
under. She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out 
as the table tips: ‘Stop fighting!’ The GM states all combatants 
below must perform an Opposed Dodge Test against the +3 SL 

optIons: on the deFensIve
What if you want to prepare to dodge or parry incoming blows, 
to  hold  a  defensive  position  in  a  doorway,  or  use  language 
(magick) to deploy an array of dispels? as your action, choose 
a skill to use defensively and you will get +20 to defensive tests 
using the skill until the start of your next turn.

aTTaCking
One  of  the  most  common  Actions  is  to  attack  an  opponent. 
To  make  a  ranged  attack,  your  weapon  must  be  in  range  (see 
Chapter  11:  Consumers’  Guide  for  weapon  ranges)  and  your 
target  visible  in  line-of-sight.  For  melee  attacks,  you  must  be 
adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged).

During  combat,  all  Difficulty  is  assumed  to  be  challenging 
(+0). So, if no Difficulty is expressly mentioned in the rules, 
use challenging.

1: Roll to Hit
Melee: To  attack,  perform  an  Opposed  Melee Test  with  your 
Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your Melee Skill — 
see page 126). Whoever scores the highest SL wins. If you win 
the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you 
lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and 
your Action is finished.

Ranged: Roll a Ranged Test for the weapon you’re using. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn’t gain Advantage in ranged combat.In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a Fumble. See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below.Summary: Test to hit your opponent with your weapon. This Test is Opposed in melee. Any winner gains +1 Advantage.2: Determine Hit LocationIf you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit and compare this number to the Hit Locations table. So, a roll of 23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm.Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit location tables. Refer to Chapter 12: Bestiary for more on the different Hit Location tables.Hit LocationsRollLocation01–09Head10–24Left Arm (or Secondary Arm)25–44Right Arm (or Primary Arm)45–79Body80–89Left Leg90–00Right LegSummary: Reverse your ‘Roll to hit’ Test result to determine a Hit Location.3: Determine DamageOnce you have determined the hit location, it is time to work out how much Damage you deal. Each weapon has a Weapon Damage characteristic (see page 293). This is usually your modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number for ranged weapons. Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using. This final number is your Damage.Summary: Damage = Weapon Damage + SL4: Apply DamageUsing the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack. Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage. The remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent. If this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the attack and only loses 1 Wound.  Should the Wounds lost exceed your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a Critical Wound (see page 172) and gains the Prone Condition (see page 169).Summary: Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)opposing a meLee attackYou can oppose an incoming melee attack with more than just your melee skill. the most obvious choice is Dodge, which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but Chapter 4: Skills and Talents lists many other skills that just might be useful in combat, including intimidate, charm, Leadership, and more. if your gm thinks it’s appropriate for the situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity to score a critical Hit against your opponent, then why not give it a go.EngagedWhenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee combat, you count as Engaged. This means you are tussling with each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc.) for being Engaged might apply. If you don’t attack each other for a full Round, you are no longer Engaged.success LeveLs in combatin combat, sL is used to determine damage, rather than getting a result from the outcome table. to mix this up a little, tests in combat also use criticals and Fumbles.CritiCals and FumblesDuring the cut and thrust of combat, accidents, mistakes, and moments of extraordinary skill can happen in quick succession. To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and Fumbles — egregious errors.CriticalsAny successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes a Critical. This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test.V

If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true. See page 172 for more on what this means. Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal, as is who wins any Opposed Tests.OptiOns: DeathblOwsome players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters able to wade through lesser foes. if this suits your style of play, use the following rule: if you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may move into the space the character occupied and attack another opponent if there is one available. You may keep doing this a number of times equal to your weapon skill bonus, and may not attack the same Character more than once on the same turn. some creatures (see Chapter 12: Bestiary) are so big they can activate this rule without killing any opponents.OppOseD tests anD FumblesDuring an Opposed test, it is possible to Fumble and still win if you score a higher sl than your opponent. this is fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the process.Example: molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls 66 for a fumble with -3 sl, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5 sl. so, molli wins with +2 sl over her opponent, gaining +1 advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will befall her.FumblesThe converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate has occurred. To determine what happens, roll on the Oops! Table.OOps! tableRollResult01–20You catch a part of your anatomy (we recommend you play this for laughs) — lose 1 Wound, ignoring Toughness Bonus or Armour Points.21–40Your melee weapon jars badly, or ranged weapon malfunctions or slightly breaks – your weapon suffers 1 Damage. Next round, you will act last regardless of Initiative order, Talents, or special rules as you recover (see page 156).41–60Your manoeuvre was misjudged, leaving you out of position, or you lose grip of a ranged weapon. Next round, your Action suffers a penalty of –10.61–70You stumble badly, finding it hard to right yourself. Lose your next Move.71–80You mishandle your weapon, or you drop your ammunition. Miss your next Action.81–90You overextend yourself or stumble and twist your ankle. Suffer a Torn Muscle (Minor) injury (see page 179). This counts as a Critical Wound.91–00You completely mess up, hitting 1 random ally in range using your rolled units die to determine the SL of the hit. If that’s not possible, you somehow hit yourself in the face and gain a Stunned Condition (see page 169).misFires!if you are using a blackpowder, engineering, or explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your primary arm location using the units die as an effective sl for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.Ranged CombatThere are some extra considerations that apply to ranged attacks: •	Ranged attacks cannot be opposed with Melee Skills unless you have a large enough shield (see page 298), or if they are at Point Blank range (see page 297), where it is also allowable to Dodge.r u l e s

You cannot make ranged attacks whilst Engaged, unless you 
are armed with a ranged weapon that has the Pistol Quality 
(see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide).

If you use your Ranged Skill when you  are  Engaged with 
your  target,  the  target  may  Oppose  your  attack  with  any 
Melee Skill.

ComBaT diffiCUlTy
Combat Tests can be modified in the same manner as other Tests. 
These modifiers can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the 
weather,  and  a  variety  of  other  factors. The  following  are  some 
of  the  most  common  modifiers  encountered  in  combat.  For 
situations not covered here, use these as a guide. Remember, the 
GM has final say about the difficulty of any particular Test.

Combining DiffiCultiesthere will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:• If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests Hard (–20). When combined, the Test would simply be Very Hard (–30), rather than suffer a –40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.• If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a Very Hard (–30) Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an Easy (+20) Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be Difficult (–10) since –30 plus +20 equals –10.Helpless TargetsMelee Tests made to hit a sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise helpless target automatically succeed. Check the Unconscious Condition for more on this (on page 169).Shooting into a GroupRanged Tests made to hit a group of targets are Average (+20) if there is 3-6 of them, Easy (+40) if there are 7-12 of them, and Very Easy (+60) if there is 13 or more of them. Any successful hits are randomised between all likely targets as the GM prefers. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.OutnumberingIf you out-number an opponent 2 to 1, you gain a bonus of +20 to hit your opponent in melee combat. If you outnumber an enemy by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit. Further, at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the GM decides who is outnumbering whom.OpTIOnS: SHOOTIng InTO MELEE For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of –20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target’s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the gM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group.SizeSize is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an apple. For more on Size, refer to Traits in Chapter 12: Bestiary. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.siZeSize Height or LengthExamplesModifierTiny Less than a footButterfly, Mouse, Pigeon–30Little Up to 2 feetCat, Hawk, Human Baby–20Small Up to 4 feetGiant Rat, Halfling, Human Child–10Average Up to 7 feetDwarf, Elf, Human0LargeUp to 12 feetHorse, Ogre, Troll+20Enormous Up to 20 feetGriffon, Wyvern, Manticore+40Monstrous 20 feet+Dragon, Giant, Daemon Prince+60r u l e s

Two-weapon fighTing 

Some  warriors  prefer  to  fight  with  a  weapon  in  each  hand  — 
such as using a sword and sword-breaker, or a sword and a shield. 
The following applies when you are fighting with two weapons. 

•	

•	

•	

You  may  use  any  one-handed  close  combat  weapon 
or any pistol when fighting with two weapons. 
You may use either hand to make an attack. Attacks made 
using  your  secondary  hand  suffer  a  –20  penalty  to  any 
applicable Test. 
If  you  have  the Dual Wielder  Talent  you  may  be  able 
to  attack  with  both  weapons.  See  Chapter  4:  Skills  and 
Talents for more on this. 

sCaTTeR 
On a failed Ranged (Throwing) Test, roll 1d10 and consults the

target.

A  roll  of  1-8  provides  a  direction:  roll  2d10  to  determine  the 
distance the weapon scatters in yards — it scatters no more than 
half the distance between you and the target. A roll of 9 and the 
weapon lands at your feet. A 10, and it lands at your target’s feet.
Scatter can be used whenever a random direction is required.

UnaRmed ComBaT 
Not  every  fight 
involves  guns  or  swords. 
in  WFRP 
Many  conflicts  are  settled  with  good,  old-fashioned  fisticuffs. 
A successful Melee (Brawling) Test for unarmed combat is handled 
in the same way as any other combat Test, but you have one extra 
option: you may enter a Grapple!

Grappling 
Instead  of  inflicting  damage  with  an  unarmed  attack,  you  can 
attempt  to  Grapple  and  immobilise  your  opponent.  You  must 
declare this is your intent before rolling to hit your opponent. If 
you win the Opposed Test, you and your opponent are Grappling, 
and your opponent gains the Entangled Condition. If you begin 
your turn Grappling, you may break the  Grapple if you  have  a 
higher Advantage than your opponent, and do not count as being 
Engaged for your Move; otherwise, you must make an Opposed 
Strength Test for your Action. If you win, you can do one of the 
following: 

•	 Deal SB + SL Damage using your Strength roll to determine 
the Hit Location affected. You ignore any Armour Points as 
you wrench arms and pull muscles.
Either: 1) Give your opponent an Entangled Condition, or 
2) Remove an Entangled Condition from yourself, plus lose 
an extra one for each SL by which you win.

•	

If you lose the Opposed Test, you can do nothing but struggle as 
your opponent gains +1 Advantage.

Those outside the Grapple gain a +20 bonus to hit the grapplers 
with the lowest Advantage, and a +10 bonus to hit to the grappler 
with the highest Advantage. 

optIons: 
GrapplInG WIth sKIlls
If you are Grappling, your Gm may allow you to perform 
a  test  other  than  an  opposed  Strength  test  according  to 
the situation. perhaps language (magick) to cast a spell, or 
charm to wheedle your way free, or leadership to order your 
grappler to stand down? as long as your Gm is happy with 
this, roll those dice and see what happens. But if you fail, note 
that you will not be concentrating on the Grapple, so the Gm 
may rule you gain an extra entangled condition, which could 
make things very tricky!

moUnTed ComBaT
Riding into Combat, sword swinging, guns blazing, is not only 
terrifying for those on the receiving end, it also brings bonuses 
to the rider. Mounted Combat uses the same rules as any other 
Combat, with the following additions:

•	

For the purposes of your Move, riders count as having the 
Movement  Attribute  of  their  mount.  Further,  riders  take 
Ride Tests  for  any  tests  to  Run,  Jump  or  similar,  and  use 
their mount’s Movement Attribute.

•	 Any melee attack from a Rider on a target smaller than their 

•	

Mount gains a bonus of +20 to hit.
If  you  are  rolling  to  hit  a  mounted  character,  you  choose 
whether  to  hit  the  rider  or  the  mount.  If  you  are  in  close 
combat, you also suffer a penalty of –10 to your Melee Test 
if you target the rider and are smaller than the mount (see 
Size on page 162).

•	 A  Mount  without  the  Skittish  Trait  (see  page  342)  is 
effectively another combatant, and may use its own Action 
to attack Engaged targets.

•	 When Charging, you may use the Strength and Size rules of 

your mount for the purposes of calculating Damage.

•	 When riding, you suffer a penalty of –20 to any attempts to 
use the Dodge Skill unless you have the Trick Riding Talent.

Note:  Most  mounts  are  bigger  than  Characters,  meaning  they 
may cause Fear or Terror, and gain other combat advantages as 
explained on page 341.

Benefits of Advantage
Each Advantage you secure adds +10 to any appropriate combat 
Test or Psychology Test (see Psychology on page 190). Thus, if 
you have 5 Advantage tokens, you have an impressive +50 bonus 
to hit, defend, and resist the influence of others.

Losing Advantage
If you lose an Opposed Test during combat, suffer any Conditions 
(see  page  167),  or  lose  any  Wounds,  you  automatically  lose  all 
Advantage. Further, should the combat end, all Advantage you’ve 
gained  is  lost.  Lastly,  if  you  have  accrued  no  Advantage  for 
the  Round,  or  end  the  Round  outnumbered,  you  lose  1  point. 
Advantage can also be used to Disengage from combat (see page 
165).  There  are  also  Skills  and  Talents  that  cause  you  to  lose 
Advantage, or transfer Advantage to another character. For more 
on these, read Chapter 4: Skills and Talents.

moving

The  amount  of  detail  needed  for  movement  depends  on  how 
you  track  where  everyone  is.  Many  prefer  to  use  the  ‘theatre 
of the mind’ method, where you describe relative positions and 
distance, and the GM adjudicates if it’s possible to undertake 
the Move or Action each player describes. Even during tightly 
controlled  combat  Rounds,  it  is  usually  enough  to  narrate  how 
your  character  negotiates  the  frenetic  action,  leaping  barrels, 
sprinting for cover, or dancing around opponents as required. 

advanTage
Advantage represents your momentum in combat, and is gained 
when you outwit, defeat, or otherwise dominate your opponents. 
It is recorded with tokens — be these coins, cards, chits, counters, 
or specially designed Advantage tokens — or by a tally sheet on 
scrap paper.

optIons: lImItInG advantaGe
some  Gms  prefer  a  more  controlled  combat  environment 
that isn’t so influenced by the whimsy of dice and luck. As 
advantage  can  swing  wildly  during  the  course  of  a  battle, 
and can have a significant impact, consider using one of the 
following optional rules if you wish to contain this:

•  advantage has an upper level equal to each character’s 

Initiative Bonus.

•  cap  advantage  at  a  pre-arranged  limit,  such  as  2,  4, 
or more. 10 also works well as you can easily track it 
with 1d10.

Gaining Advantage
Advantage  is  secured  each  time  you  win  an  Opposed  Test  in 
combat, you assess the battlefield using your Skills, or when your 
spirits are lifted. The following provides some examples of this, 
but is far from exhaustive, and the GM is encouraged to hand out 
Advantage tokens as suits the circumstances.

•	

Surprise: Attacking Surprised enemies brings +1 
Advantage. See page 169.

•	 Charging: Charging headlong into combat grants +1 

•	

•	

Advantage. See page 165.
Assess: If you use one of your Skills to secure a tactical 
advantage, gain +1 Advantage. See individual Skill 
descriptions in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents for more 
details concerning this.
Victory: Whenever you defeat an important NPC, gain 
+1 Advantage. Subduing a party nemesis may grant +2 
Advantage.

•	 Winning: If you win an Opposed Test during combat gain 

+1 Advantage.

•	 Outmanouevre: If you wound an opponent without 
engaging in an Opposed Test, gain +1 Advantage.

There is also an array of Talents that secure Advantage. Refer to 
Chapter 4: Skills and Talents for more on this.

Other groups use floorplans, grids, tokens, and Citadel Miniatures to represent where the combatants are standing, and this method needs a bit more specific information on distance and movement.  If you do this, we recommend a 1-inch grid, with each square representing a distance of 2 yards in the game world. This means if you have Movement 4, you can normally move 4 squares. Humans, Mutants, and other similarly-sized creatures occupy a single square on the map. Larger creatures can take up 2, 4, or even more squares, according to their Size trait (see page 341). If you prefer to go gridless, keep the 1 Movement = 2 yards scale.Moving During CoMbatThe Movement Table shows how many yards you can normally move in a single Turn, either Walking or Running, without having to make an Athletics Test to sprint. Doing this will use your Move for your Turn.MoveMent tableMovementWalk (yards)Run (yards)000124248361248165102061224714288163291836102040ChargingIf you are not Engaged in combat already, you can use your Move to Charge. If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.DisengagingIf you are Engaged in combat (see page 159), and no longer wish to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following two options for leaving combat safely.Use Advantage: If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily manoeuvre yourself beyond reach. If you choose to drop your Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an opponent’s face!Use Dodge: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you will need to use your Action to make an Opposed Dodge/Melee Test. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere you wish using the normal rules. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for you to escape without a blow to your back.FleeingIf you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee as your Move. Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by Terror (see page 191) or magic.If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and may attempt 1 free attack. The free attack is an unopposed Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored to Damage you as normal. As you are throwing caution to the wind, your opponent gains +20 to hit you. If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a Challenging (+0) Cool Test: if failed, gain a Broken Condition, and a further +1 Broken condition per SL below 0.  Once the free attack is concluded, you may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table) directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can.RunningOn your turn, you can use your Action to sprint. This requires an Average (+20) Athletics Test, and the distance covered is in addition to your Move this round. You sprint your Run movement + SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement). So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an additional 14 yards (16–2=14).ClimbingMost climb moves won’t need Tests. Climbing rules are only required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how long you take to ascend is important.Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not require a Test but does slow you down. You move at half rate up or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces. So, it would cost 4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder. If you want to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an Average (+20) Climb Test. You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards. So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an additional 6 yards (4+2=6).If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn. You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards.V

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature 
of  the  climbed  surface.  Some  climbs  will  be  beyond  the  ability 
of most characters without the Scale Sheer Surface Talent (see 
page 144).

3:  Update  Distance  — The  lowest  SL  of  the  pursued  and  the 
highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between 
these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted 
from the Distance number if the pursuers won.

leaping, and falling
Jumping to reach high ledges, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, or 
failing both and plummeting to your death are all essential parts 
of the WFRP experience. 

Simple Athletics Tests, or perhaps a Perform (Acrobatics) Test, 
will be enough to determine the outcome on most occasions, but 
sometimes knowing exactly how high you jump, how far you leap, 
or what happens when you fall is useful.

Leaping
You can leap your Movement in feet without having to make a 
Test.  If  you  want  to  jump  farther,  this  takes  an  Average  (+20) 
Athletics Test if you have a run up of at least your Movement in 
yards; if you do not, the Test is Challenging (+0). On a success, 
each SL adds an extra foot to the leap. If you succeeded with +0 
SL, you manage an extra 6 inches with your jump.

Falling
When falling, you suffer 1d10 Damage, plus 3 Damage for every 
yard you fall. Any suffered Damage is reduced by your Toughness 
Bonus, but not any Armour Points you may be wearing.

If  you  are  purposefully  falling  —  or,  if  you  prefer,  jumping 
downwards — you can attempt an Average (+20) Athletics Test 
to lessen the damage you may sustain. If successful, you count as 
having fallen 1 less yard, plus an extra yard less per SL scored. 

If you reduce the distance you count as having fallen to 0 or less, 
you will suffer no Damage from the fall.

If  more  Wounds  are  suffered  from  a  fall  than  your Toughness 
Bonus, you also gain the Prone Condition.

pURsUiT
Desperate  chase  scenes  through  busy  markets  and  high-speed 
pursuits  hanging  from  the  back  of  careening  coaches  are  the 
centrepiece  of  many  exciting  adventures.  Here’s  how  to  run  a 
pursuit:

1: Determine Distance — The GM decides how far ahead the 
pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent 
the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will 
range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good 
lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.

2: Test —  Everyone  actively  moving  in  the  pursuit  rolls  a Test 
for  their  movement  —  typically  this  will  be  a  Drive,  Ride,  or 
Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances. 

4: Determine Outcome — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the 
pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice 
their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest 
continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If 
the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who 
stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. 
If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite 
likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If 
Distance  reaches  10+,  the  pursuers  have  lost  their  quarry  and 
the  pursuit  is  over…  for  now!  If  the  Distance  is  still  1–9,  the 
pursuit continues, return to step 2.

As  each  Round  passes,  it’s  important  to  describe  what  just 
happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, 
describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity 
to  make  ground.  If  you  score  a  negative  SL,  describe  tripping 
over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against 
a wall, slowing you down.

Example:  Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists 
through the streets of Altdorf. The cultists got a decent head 
start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2. Each character 
rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit. Sigrid scores +3 SL;  
the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2 
SL. 

So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest 
cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is 
3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists. The 
cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of 
saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned 
aberrant. 

Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference 
between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so 
Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again.

Movement Modifiers
If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, 
they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if 
you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you 
would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.

Example: Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase 
down two Bandits. Her horse has Movement 8, where the 
Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses. Thus, the 
first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1 
SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all 
roll their Ride (Horse) Tests.

— but some magical and divine effects can set you alight even if 
you are not normally combustible! 

optIons: 
chase complIcatIon
the pursuit rules are more than enough for a fast, fun chase 
scene. however, for those looking to add more detail, consider 
the following two options, and embellish them as required.

dodge that!: each round, the character who rolled the highest 
sl can create an obstacle. an obstacle could be pulling a 
pile of barrels into the path of a pursuer, or perhaps calling 
out  for  help  to  catch  someone  running  away.  the  winner 
chooses one character: that character suffers a penalty of –1 
sl next round as they have to deal with the obstacle. make 
sure to take time to describe exactly what has happened to 
keep the chase entertaining.

consider the environment: perhaps there is a bridge coming 
up? or a gap to jump? or a fence to leap over? or a city 
gate to pass through? the Gm can throw in different tests as 
the rounds progress, mixing up the requirement each round. 
so, round 1 may need an athletics test as everyone runs, 
round 2 may require a leadership or Intimidate test to pass 
through a guarded gate, round 3 may need another athletics 
test  to  jump  a  small  stream,  and  round  4  may  be  sprint 
across an open field (modified by Movement again).

conditionS

Conditions  represent  the  effects  of  things  that  can  happen  to 
you in the course of your adventures.  The Conditions you suffer 
from can be recorded on a scrap sheet of paper, or you can use 
chits  or  counters  to  represent  them.  Each  Condition  explains 
how long any effects usually last in its description; however, it’s 
possible the cause of a Condition — such as a spell or critical 
wound — may override this. Note: If you suffer any Conditions, 
you immediately lose all Advantage (see page 164).

mUlTiple CondiTions
You  can  be  subject  to  the  same  Condition  more  than  once; 
indeed,  sometimes  you  will  receive  multiples  of  the  same 
Condition  from  a  single  event.  If  this  occurs,  any  penalties 
suffered are stacked. So, if you have three Bleeding Conditions, 
you’re losing a worrying 3 Wounds per Round; or if you have 
3 Fatigued Conditions, you suffer –30 to all Tests. You can also 
be subject to multiple, different Conditions at once. When this 
occurs,  the  effects do not  stack;  you  suffer  the  highest  of  the

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

At the end of every Round, you suffer 1d10 Wounds, modified by 
Toughness Bonus and the Armour Points on the least protected 
Hit Location, with a minimum of 1 Wound suffered. Each extra 
Ablaze Condition you have adds +1 to the Damage suffered; so, 
three Ablaze Conditions result in 1d10+2 Damage suffered.

used to run away as fast as possible until you are in a good hiding 
place  beyond  the  sight  of  any  enemy;  then  you  can  use  your 
Action  on  a  Skill  that  allows  you  to  hide  more  effectively. You 
also receive a penalty of –10 to all Tests not involving running 
and hiding.

One Ablaze Condition can be removed with a successful Athletics 
Test,  with  each  SL  removing  an  extra Ablaze  Condition.  The 
Difficulty  for  this Test  is  modified  by  circumstances:  it’s  much 
easier to put out a fire rolling around on sand than it is in the 
middle of an oil-soaked kitchen.

Bleeding
You are bleeding badly. Lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round, 
ignoring all modifiers. Further, suffer a penalty of –10 to any Tests 
to resist Festering Wounds, Minor Infection, or Blood Rot (see 
page 186). If you reach 0 Wounds, you no longer lose Wounds 
and instead fall immediately unconscious (gain the Unconscious 
Condition).  At  the  end  of  Round,  you  have  a  10%  chance  of 
dying per Bleeding Condition you have; so, if you had 3 Bleeding 
Conditions, you would die from blood loss on a roll of 0–30. If 
a double is scored on this roll, your wound clots a little: lose 1 
Bleeding  Condition.  You  cannot  regain  consciousness  until  all 
Bleeding Conditions are removed (see Injury on page 172).

A Bleeding  Condition  can  be  removed  with:  a  successful  Heal 
Test,  with  each  SL  removing  an  extra Bleeding  Condition;  or 
with any spell or prayer that heals Wounds, with one Condition 
removed per Wound healed.

Once  all Bleeding  Conditions  are  removed,  gain  one Fatigued 
Condition.

You cannot Test to rally from being Broken if you are Engaged 
with an enemy (see page 159). If you are unengaged, at the end 
of each Round, you may attempt a Cool Test to remove a Broken 
Condition,  with  each  SL  removing  an  extra Broken  Condition, 
and the Difficulty determined by the circumstances you currently 
find yourself: it is much easier to rally when hiding behind a barrel 
down an alleyway far from danger (Average +20) than it is when 
three  steps  from  a  slavering  Daemon  screaming  for  your  blood 
(Very Hard –30).

If you spend a full Round in hiding out of line-of-sight of any 
enemy, you remove 1 Broken Condition.

Once  all  Broken  Conditions  are  removed,  gain  1  Fatigued 
Condition.

Deafened
Whether caused by a loud noise or a blow to the head, you are 
unable  to  hear  properly.  You  suffer  a  –10  penalty  to  all  Tests 
involving  hearing,  and  any  opponent  attacking  you  in  close 
combat  from  the  flank  or  rear  gains  an  extra  bonus  of  +10  to 
hit  you  (this  bonus  does  not  increase  with  multiple Deafened 
Conditions). One Deafened condition is removed at the end of 
every other Round and is often replaced with tinnitus.

Entangled
You  are  wrapped  in  something  restricting  your  movement;  it 
could be ropes, spider’s webbing, or an opponent’s bulging biceps. 
On your turn, you may not Move, and all your actions involving 
movement  of  any  kind  suffer  a  penalty  of  –10  (including 
Grappling;  see  page  163).  For  your  Action,  you  can  remove  an 
Entangled  Condition  if  you  win  an  Opposed  Strength  Test 
against the source of the entanglement, with each SL removing 
an extra Entangled Condition. 

Blinded
Perhaps because of a flash of light, or because of liquid sprayed in 
your face, you are unable to see properly. You suffer a –10 penalty 
to  all Tests  involving  sight,  and  any  opponent  attacking  you  in 
close combat gains a bonus of +10 to hit you.

One Blinded  Condition  is  removed  at  the  end  of  every  other 
Round.

Broken
You are terrified, defeated, panicked, or otherwise convinced you 
are going to die. On your turn, your Move and Action must be

each sl extends how many rounds pass before you need test

Fatigued
You are exhausted or stressed, and certainly in need of rest. You 
suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests. Removing a Fatigued Condition 
normally  requires  rest,  a  spell,  or  a  divine  effect,  though  in 
some  instances,  such  as  when  a Fatigued  Condition  is  caused 
by carrying too much (see Encumbrance on page 293), simply 
changing  your  circumstances  (carrying  fewer  trappings,  for 
example) can remove a Condition.

hoW much rest?
how much rest is required to remove a Fatigued condition 
is  up  to  the  Gm  and  the  style  of  game  you  are  playing. 
some groups prefer a relatively realistic approach and remove 
a Fatigue condition after a prolonged rest. others require only 
an hour or so of rest for each Fatigue condition, preferring 
to press on with the adventure rather than worry about tired 
characters. and some remove a Fatigue condition per round of 
rest, keeping things fast and simple. It’s up to you and your 
group to decide how much rest you need.

Poisoned
You  have  been  poisoned  or  injected  with  venom.  All  Tests  to 
remove  poison  have  their  difficulty  determined  by  the  poison 
or  venom  suffered.  At  the  end  of  each  Round,  lose  1  Wound, 
ignoring all modifiers. Also, suffer a penalty of –10 to all Tests. 

If  you  reach  0  Wounds  when Poisoned,  you  cannot  heal  any 
Wounds  until  all Poisoned  conditions  are  removed.  If  you  fall 
Unconscious  when Poisoned,  make  an  Endurance  Test  after 
a  number  of  Rounds  equal  to  your  Toughness  Bonus  or  die 
horribly. See Injury on page 172 for more on this.

At  the  end  of  each  Round,  you  may  attempt  an  Endurance 
Test. If successful, remove a Poisoned Condition, with each SL 
removing an extra Poisoned Condition. A Heal Test provides the 
same results. Once all Poisoned Conditions are removed, gain 1 
Fatigued Condition.

Prone
You  have  fallen  to  the  ground,  possibly  because  you  have  run 
out  of  Wounds,  you’ve  tripped,  or  because  you’ve  been  hit  by 
something  rather  large.  On  your  turn,  your  Move  can  only  be 
used to stand up or crawl at half your Movement in yards (note: 
if you have 0 Wounds remaining, you can only crawl). You suffer 
a –20 penalty to all Tests involving movement of any kind, and 
any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains +20 
to hit you.

Unlike most other conditions, Prone does not stack — you are 
either Prone, or you are not. You lose the Prone Condition when 
you stand up.

Stunned
You have been struck about the head or otherwise disorientated 
or confused; your ears are likely ringing, and little makes sense. 

You  are  incapable  of  taking  an  Action  on  your  turn  but  are 
capable of half your normal movement. You can defend yourself 
in  opposed  Tests  —  but  not  with  Language  (Magick).  You 
also  suffer  a  –10  penalty  to  all Tests.  If  you  have  any Stunned 
Conditions, any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat 
gains +1 Advantage before rolling the attack.

At the end of each Round, you may attempt a Challenging (+0) 
Endurance Test. If successful, remove a Stunned Condition, with 
each SL removing an extra Stunned Condition.

Once  all Stunned  Conditions  are  removed,  gain  1 Fatigued 
Condition if you don’t already have one.

Surprised
You  have  been  caught  unawares  and  you  aren’t  at  all  ready  for 
what’s about to hit you. You can take no Action or Move on your 
turn and cannot defend yourself in opposed Tests. Any opponent 
trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains a bonus of  +20 to hit.

The Surprised  Condition  does  not  stack,  so  you  do  not  collect 
multiple Surprised  Conditions,  even  should  you  be  technically 
surprised multiple times in a Round.

At the end of each Round, or after the first attempt to attack you, 
you lose the Surprised Condition.

Unconscious
You  are  knocked  out,  asleep,  or  otherwise  insensible.  You  can 
do  nothing  on  your  turn  and  are  completely  unaware  of  your 
surroundings.  An  attacker  targeting  you  gains  the  benefit  of 
the  I Will  Not  Fail  rule  on  page  171  without  having  to  spend 
a Resilience point. Or, if the GM prefers, any close combat hit 
simply kills you. Any ranged combat hit automatically does the 
same if the shooter is at Point Blank range.

The Unconscious  Condition  does  not  stack  —  you  are  either 
Unconscious,  or  you  are  not  —  so  you  do  not  collect  multiple 
Unconscious Conditions.

Recovering from unconsciousness requires different circumstances 
depending  upon  why  you  fell  unconscious.  Refer  to  Injury  on 
page 172 for more on this. If you spend a Resolve point to remove 
an Unconscious condition, but have not resolved the cause of the 
incapacitation, you  gain another Unconscious Condition at the 
end  of  the  round.  When  you  lose  the Unconscious  Condition, 
you gain the Prone and Fatigued Conditions.

FAte & ReSilience

Whether  it’s  guts,  luck  or  the  favour  of  the  gods,  there  is 
something special about you. Fate and  Resilience  represent  the 
different ways you stand out from the masses. 

Characters gain their starting Fate and Resilience in Character 
Generation (see page 34). Both are related to pools of points: 
Fate  to  Fortune,  Resilience  to  Resolve.  You  may  spend  your 
points to achieve small benefits, and these pools will refill over 
the course of play. You spend your Fate or Resilience points for 
a  significant  benefit  during  play  but  this  permanently  reduces 
them and also reduces the associated pool of Fortune or Resolve 
points. While Fate and Resilience points may be regained, this 
occurs only rarely, so spend them carefully. 

failed Tests or gain an edge as luck favours you, and the number 
you have will likely fluctuate wildly during play. Fate determines 
how  many  Fortune  points  you  can  have,  and  be  permanently 
spent in the direst of circumstances to avoid death.

Spending Fortune
You may spend a Fortune point from your pool to turn luck to 
your  advantage:  hitting  with  that  difficult  crossbow  shot  when 
you would have otherwise missed; or perhaps an opponent slips, 
granting you a chance to land a blow. Your three options are:

Reroll a failed Test.

•	
•	 Add +1 SL to a Test after it is rolled.
•	 At the start of the Round, choose when to act in that Round 

disregarding Initiative order.

Although they are very rare and normally reserved for PCs, the 
GM may also want to apply Fate and Resilience to noteworthy 
NPCs, like a necromantic nemesis, a local luminary of significance, 
or a recurring cult leader.

Spending Fate 
You may spend a permanent Fate point to avoid death and survive 
even the most unlikely situations. When you do this, choose one 
of the following two options:

faTe and foRTUne
Player  characters  have  destiny. While  their  ultimate  future  is  a 
mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or 
even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important.

•	 Die  Another  Day:  Instead  of  dying,  your  character  is 
knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise 
taken  out  of  action;  your  character  will  survive,  no  matter 
the fatal incident’s circumstances, but takes no further part 
in the current encounter.

To represent this, you begin play with a number of Fate Points. 
Fate  points  mark  you  out  from  the  rest  of  the  denizens  of  the 
Old World. They allow you to survive against impossible odds and 
prevail where ordinary folk fail.

Fate  is  directly  related  to  your  Fortune  points.  Fortune  points 
are spent to receive minor bonuses, including the ability to reroll 

•	 How  Did  That  Miss?:  Your  character  completely  avoids 
the  incoming  damage  by  some  extraordinary  fluke,  such 
as  slipping  just  as  a  blow  is  about  to  connect,  a  weapon 
mysteriously  jamming,  or  an  unexpected  source  of  light 
blinding  an  opponent;  your  character  can  continue  on 
without  penalty,  but  has  no  guarantee  of  survival  in  later 
rounds.

r u l e s

V

Spending Resolve
You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves: 
maybe  confronting  a  terrifying  Ogre  without  flinching;  or 
ignoring  the  effects  of  even  the  most  powerful  of  blows.  Your 
choices are:

•	

•	

•	

Become  immune  to  Psychology  until  the  end  of  the  next 
round. See Psychology on page 190.
Ignore  all  modifiers  from  all  Critical  Wounds  until  the 
beginning of the next round.
Remove  one  Condition; 
Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet.

if  you  removed  the  Prone 

The  first  option  takes  you  out  of  play,  but  allows  you  to  fight 
another  day,  for  all  your  character  may  be  battered,  bloody, 
bruised,  and  perhaps  even  captured  in  the  process! The  second 
option  allows  you  to  continue  fighting  side-by-side  with  your 
companions,  but  leaves  you  in  significant  danger,  meaning 
you  may  need  to  spend  more  Fate  points  in  later  Rounds  to 
ensure  survival.  Each  option  has  advantages  and  disadvantages, 
depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you 
to decide which is the best choice to take.

The  GM  describes  how  you  survive  a  given  situation  after 
spending a Fate rating point. 

Regaining Fate and Fortune
You  regain  all  Fortune  points  at  the  start  of  every  gaming 
session, up to the maximum of your current Fate. In addition, 
certain  in-game  encounters  may  also  replenish  (or  remove!) 
Fortune points. 

Your  GM  may  grant  you  a  Fate  point  for  an  act  of  extreme 
heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally this only happens at 
the  successful  end  of  an  important  adventure,  so  make  sure  to 
spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.

lonG GamInG sessIons
some  players  prefer  short  sessions  of  a  few  hours,  others 
prefer  day-long  marathons.  If  your  group  prefers  longer 
sessions,  replenish  Fortune  points  at  narratively  appropriate 
moments, roughly every four hours.

ResilienCe and Resolve 
While  Fate  points  represent  your  destiny,  perhaps  chosen  by 
some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your 
personal  drive  and  determination  to  endure,  and  overcome,  no 
matter the obstacles you face.

Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time 
called Resolve. Resolve points are spent to push through minor 
obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds 
for a Round or removing Conditions. Resilience determines your 
upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to 
push yourself through seemingly impossible situations.

Spending Resilience
You  may  also  choose  to  spend  Resilience  point  to  defy  the 
corruption  curling  within,  or  to  succeed  where  it  would  seem 
certain you should fail. Here, you have the following two options:

•	

•	

I  Deny  You!:  You  may  choose  not  to  develop  a  rolled 
mutation. Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any 
Corruption  points.  See  Corruption  on  page  182  for  more 
on this.

I Will Not Fail!: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you 
choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even 
the direst of situations. In an Opposed Test, you always win 
by at least 1 SL. If you cause a Critical, you can choose the 
Hit  Location  struck  rather  than  randomising  it.  You  can 
even choose to do this on a Test already failed.

Example: A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built 
up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows. Things are 
about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but 
loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot. 
So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will 
Not Fail’. This means she automatically wins the Opposed 
Test by +1 SL. She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11, 
causing a Critical. The bandit leader will take some Wounds 
and a Critical Wound. More importantly, his rampage comes 
to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns 
in the heroes favour. 

171

V

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is 
wise,  but  it  does  not  remove  your  Corruption  points,  meaning 
mutation is still perilously close. By comparison, using permanent 
Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow 
on  an  otherwise  impossible-to-hit  target,  create  an  artefact 
that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly 
manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast.

When  you  spend  a  Resilience  point,  take  time  to  describe  the 
enormous  feat  of  will  your  character  has  undertaken,  and  how 
this manifests in play.

Regaining Resilience and Resolve
Resolve  is  regained  whenever  you  act  according  to  your 
Motivation (see Motivation on page 34). During play, whenever 
you  feel  you  have  done  this,  you  may  ask  the  GM  if  you  can 
recover one or more Resolve points.

Example: Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’. While 
her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local 
temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity. As this fits 
her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve 
points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate 
in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week. 

The  GM  may  grant  a  Resilience  point  for  an  act  of  extreme 
importance  to  your  Motivation,  permanently  nourishing  your 
soul, but such an event will be very rare.

Example: After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a 
new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from 
Nuln. The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s 
faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point.

injuRy

Almost all characters will suffer injuries during the course of play. 
The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal 
them, when possible.

woUnds, CRiTiCal woUnds, 
and deaTh
Wound  loss  represents  minor  cuts  and  abrasions,  bruises  and 
bashes,  and  even  the  depletion  of  spiritual  and  mental  energy 
reserves. By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe, 
expressing  serious  injuries,  broken  bones,  torn  muscles,  and 
ripped flesh. Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death.

Wounds
Wounds  are  lost  by  sustaining  Damage.  Each  time  you  suffer  a 
point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 8 points of 
Damage,  you  lose  8  Wounds.  Often,  especially  in  combat,  your 
Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage. 

So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness 
Bonus  was  3,  and  you  had  leather  armour  on  that  arm  for  1 
Armour  Point,  you  would  suffer  6  Wounds  (10–3–1=6).  The 
rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with 
Toughness and Armour Points. 

If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm 
you, and you gain the Prone Condition. Until you heal at least 
1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re 
not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness 
Bonus,  you  will  pass  out,  gaining  the Unconscious  Condition. 
You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1 
Wound (see Healing on page 181).

If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative 
Wounds  —  say  you  suffered  5  Damage  when  you  only  had  2 
Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound. If you suffer fewer 
negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4 
Wounds  if  your Toughness  Bonus  is  4),  you  subtract  –20  from 
your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01 (see page 
174).  Note:  You  never  actually  go  into  negative  Wounds.  The 
lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0.

Critical Wounds
Critical Wounds  are  most  commonly  suffered  in  combat  when 
something really  wants  to  hurt  you.  The  two  most  frequent 
sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or 
when you lose more Wounds than you have (see Combat on page 
159 for more on how Critical Hits happens). 

Each  Critical  Wound  you  receive  will  impact  your  ability  to 
function in a different way. To determine what effects a Critical 
Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables (see page 174).

172

r u l e s

V

Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on 
the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still 
standing.

Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in 
death. Should any of these occur, it is time to permanently spend 
a Fate point if you have one (see page 170).

optIons: sudden death
rather than worrying about critical Wounds and protracted 
deaths, you may simply wish to know if someone is dead or 
not. the Gm can do this by using the sudden death rules, 
which significantly accelerates play. When your targets suffer 
more damage than they have Wounds, they simply die in a 
suitably dramatic fashion or immediately gain the unconscious 
condition. your choice.

sudden  death  is  especially  useful  for  quickly  dealing  with 
minor  foes  such  as  Brigands,  cultists,  or  Wild  animals, 
although it should not be used for pcs or important npcs. 

pullInG your BloWs
The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical 
Wound  you  can.  however,  it’s  also  possible  you  may  just 
want  to  subdue,  not  kill,  your  opponents.  or  you  may  be 
sparring. With that in mind, you may ignore any critical hit 
you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are 
‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit. If you do this, make 
sure you describe the situation appropriately, making it clear 
you’re using the flat of your blade or otherwise doing what you 
can to avoid properly hurting your opponent.

Death
If  you  take  the Unconscious  Condition  and  have  0  Wounds, 
compare  the  total  number  of  Critical  Wounds  you  currently 
suffer  with  your  Toughness  Bonus.  If  you  have  more  Critical 
Wounds  than  your  Toughness  Bonus,  you  succumb  to  your 
horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by 
some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds. 

Also, if you have the Unconscious Condition, anyone attacking 
you  with  suitable  weapons  can  kill  you,  should  they  wish.

CritiCal tablesWhen you receive a Critical Wound by losing more Wounds than you have, roll 1d100 and refer to the appropriate Critical table to determine what has happened. When you receive a Critical Hit (see page 159), you do not determine the struck location by reversing your roll as normal. instead, you roll 1d100 again and refer to Determine Hit Location (see page 159), then roll another 1d100 and refer to the appropriate Critical Table to determine what has happened. You suffer the number of Wounds indicated, not modified by Toughness bonus or armour Points, though these will never trigger a second Critical Wound. Further, you suffer any additional effects noted. if your Character suffers from the Unconscious Condition, you remain unconscious until the end of the encounter, or until you receive Medical attention (see Healing on page 181), unless otherwise stated. if a result says you have broken bones, torn muscles, or an amputated body part, refer to Broken Bones on page 179, Torn Muscles on page 179, or Amputated Parts on page 180, for what happens.

The  Hit  Location  is  effectively  unusable  until  the  breakage 
heals. Use all the same rules as for Broken Bone (Minor).

Healing: Healing takes 10 days longer. All associated Tests are 
Challenging (+0). Any penalties for failed Tests increase to –10.

healInG hands
critical Wounds are frequently nasty, so if you want to survive 
your journeys through the old World, it is recommended you 
wear  armour  and  bring  at  least  one  companion  with  some 
form of healing skills or spells, and perhaps even one skilled 
in surgery. If you do not, you may succumb to your wounds 
or infection long before you reach the next settlement.

BRoken Bones
Small fractures may heal on their own accord, but severe breaks, 
with bone protruding at odd angles from the flesh, are a different 
matter entirely. If you suffer a Broken Bone, it will be marked as 
minor or major.

Minor
You  have  fractured  one  of  your  bones,  but  it  is  still  aligned, 
meaning it may heal of its own accord without medical attention. 
The Hit Location is unusable until the breakage heals. For Arm 
and Leg hits, you are down to one limb as the other is too painful 
to use, and may require binding. Use the rules for a Severed Arm 
or Leg to represent this (see Amputated Parts). 

For Head hits you will be down to a liquid diet and will suffer a 
penalty of –30 to all Language Tests. For Body hits, your strength 
and mobility will be severely limited: suffer a loss of –30 to your 
Strength and Agility Characteristics, and half your Move.

Healing: A fractured bone will take 30+1d10 days to heal. At the 
end  of  this,  a  successful  Average (+20) Endurance Test  means 
the bone has set well, and no long-term effects will be suffered. If 
the Test is failed, you suffer a permanent loss of –5 to all Agility 
Tests when using a damaged arm, a permanent loss of –5 to your 
Agility  characteristic  for  a  badly  healed  Body  or  Leg  hit,  or  a 
permanent loss of –5 to spoken Language Tests for a badly healed 
Head hit. 

A successful Average (+20) Heal Test within a week of receiving 
the  fracture  will  negate  the  need  for  the  Endurance  Test,  but 
the  affected  area  must  remain  bound  and  held  in  place  for  the 
duration of the healing. If the binding should be undone, another 
Average (+20) Heal Test  enacted  within  a  day  will  need  to  be 
passed to avoid the Endurance Test.

Major
One of your bones is badly broken, and is either resting at an odd 
angle, or has splintered at the point of breakage. It is unlikely to 
heal properly without medical attention.

ToRn mUsCles
Sprains or tears to your muscles or ligaments result in significant 
pain and possible loss of use depending upon the severity, which 
will be marked as minor or major.

Minor
One  of  your  muscles  is  sprained  or  torn,  resulting  in  impaired 
capabilities and much pain. Suffer a penalty of –10 to all Tests 
involving the location. If a Leg is hit, also halve your Movement.

179

V

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Healing: The muscle will partially heal in 30 – your Toughness 
Bonus days. Use of the Healing skill will reduce the time by 1 day, 
plus a further day per SL (you can gain this benefit once).

Major
One  of  your  muscles  or  some  important  tendons  have  been 
severely damaged, resulting in extreme pain and a significant loss 
in capability of the afflicted limb.  

Suffer the same effects as Torn Muscle (Minor), but the penalties 
are –20 to all Tests.

Healing: The muscle will partially heal in 30 – your Toughness 
Bonus days, after which the penalty for using the limb reduces 
to  –10  to  all  relevant  Tests.  The  muscle  will  completely  heal 
after  another  30  –  your  Toughness  Bonus  days.  Use  of  the 
Healing skill does little but inform you not to use the affected 
Hit Location.

ampUTaTed paRTs
Many of the more severe Critical Wounds result in the loss of a 
body part, such as fingers, hands, feet, or even a whole leg! Should 
a character suffer more than one severed body part, it is probably 
time to start looking for an appropriate replacement to mitigate 
any possible penalties (see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide).

Whenever  you  suffer  a  Critical  Wound  marked  Amputation 
(difficulty),  you  must  pass  an  Endurance Test  (the  difficulty  is 
marked in the brackets) or gain a Prone Condition. On a Failure 
(–2) or worse, you also gain a Stunned Condition; on an Impressive 
Failure (–4 or worse), gain an Unconscious Condition. 

All  amputations  require  Surgery  to  heal  properly,  meaning  1 
Wound cannot be healed until you visit a surgeon. See Surgery 
on page 181.

Arm
Use the rules for lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the 
arm since you don’t have one. 

Ear
Losing an ear is painful, but you will soon learn to live without it. 
Should you have the bad luck to lose both your ears, permanently 
suffer  a  penalty  of  –20  to  all  hearing-based  Perception  Tests. 
Further, you suffer a penalty of –5 to all Fellowship Tests per ear 
lost when others can see your earless state.

Eye
For  all  losing  an  eye  is  horrendous,  but  you  soon  learn  to 
compensate. Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes, 
suffer  a  penalty  of  –30  to  all Tests  influenced  by  sight,  such  as 
Weapon Tests, Dodge Tests, Ride Tests, and similar. Further, you 
suffer a penalty of –5 to all Fellowship Tests per scarred socket 
others can see.

Fingers
Losing  a  finger  results  in  lessened  grip,  causing  an  increased 
chance of fumbling Tests using that hand. For the first finger lost, 
any  relevant,  failed Test  with  a  1  on  the  units  die  counts  as  a 
fumble. For two lost fingers, any relevant, failed Test with a 1 or 2 
on the units die counts as a fumble, and so on. 

Further,  you  suffer  a  penalty  of  –5  to  all Tests  using  the  hand 
in question per finger lost. Once 4 or more fingers are lost on a 
hand, use the rules for a severed hand.

Foot
Reduce your Move by half permanently and suffer a –20 penalty 
to  all Tests  that  rely  on  mobility,  such  as  Dodge.  Losing  both 
feet makes it hard to walk. Perhaps you could hire a henchman 
to carry you? 

Hand
You take a –20 penalty on all Tests that rely on the use of two 
hands  and  you  cannot  wield  two-handed  weapons;  however,  a 
shield can be strapped to the injured arm. Should the lost hand be 
your primary hand, you take the customary –20 penalty to Melee 
Tests made with weapons using your secondary hand. For every 
100 XP you spend, you can reduce this penalty by 5 as you relearn 
how to do everything with the other hand. If you lose both hands, 
it is probably time to master hook fighting.

Leg
Treat this as a lost foot, but you cannot use the Dodge skill at all.

Nose
A loss of a nose leaves one looking freakish in the extreme. Suffer 
a permanent loss of –20 to your Fellowship and suffer a penalty 
of –30 to all Tests involving the sense of smell.

Teeth
Loss of teeth may be unsightly and can make eating difficult. For 
every  two  teeth  you  lose  you  also  suffer  a  permanent  loss  of  1 
from your Fellowship characteristic. 

Further, once more than half your teeth (Humans: 16; Elves: 18; 
Halflings  and  Dwarfs:  20)  are  lost,  you  find  consuming  solids 
significantly  more  difficult  than  your  peers,  doubling  eating 
times,  and  making  some  foodstuffs  nigh-on  impossible  to  eat, 
which is largely a matter of roleplaying and narrative description 
of your actions.

Toes
Loss of toes has an adverse effect on your balance. For each toe 
lost, suffer a permanent loss of –1 to your Agility and Weapon 
Skill Characteristics.

Tongue
A loss of a tongue leaves you grunting and humming, or relying on 
make-shift sign language, for communication. You automatically 
fail all Language Tests involving speaking.

healing
In time, most injuries heal. But some are worse than others. The 
following explains how to heal Wounds and Critical Wounds.

Healing Wounds
You are considered wounded if you have lost any of your Wounds. 

Without  medical  attention,  you  can  attempt  an  Average 
(+20) Endurance Test after a good sleep once a day. You Heal 
Wounds  equal  to  the  SL  +  your  Toughness  Bonus.  For  each 
day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of 
Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. 

If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to 
be  attended  by  someone  with  the  Heal  skill  (see  Chapter  4: 
Skills and Talents) or you’ll need bandages, a healing poultice, 
or similar (see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide).

There  is  no  penalty  for  being  wounded.  Lost  Wounds  are 
considered  to  be  small  cuts,  bruises,  and  other  easily  ignored 
injuries.

Healing Critical Wounds
If  you  have  received  any  Critical  Wounds,  you  are  said  to  be 
Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer 
to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you 
suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not 
count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and 
all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are 
Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the 
normal rules.

mediCal aTTenTion
Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved 
until  you  receive  medical  attention.  This  includes,  but  is  not 
limited to, the following:

Successful use of the Heal skill.

•	
•	 Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.
Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.
•	

Surgery
Some  wounds  are  beyond  simple  stitching  and  foul-smelling 
poultices.  If  you  suffer  a  Critical  Wound  where  surgery  is 
required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer 
the  marked  penalties  until  you  visit  an  appropriately  trained 
doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine 
surgery equivalent.

oTheR damage
The Old World is a dangerous place, hiding countless ways to die. 
The following covers some of the more common other ways you 
can receive Damage during play.  

Drowning and Suffocation
If prepared, you can hold your breath for Toughness Bonus x 10 
seconds without a Test. After that, you may start to suffocate or 
drown. If you are unprepared and suddenly deprived of air, you 
will start to suffocate immediately.

Each Round you are being suffocated you lose 1 Wound. Should 
you reach 0 Wounds, you immediately receive the Unconscious 
Condition. After that, you will die of suffocation or drowning in 
Toughness Bonus Rounds.

Exposure
Every 4 hours spent in a difficult environment — such as sub-
zero temperatures, a hot desert, or a howling storm — requires 
you  take  an  Endurance  Test.  Extreme  environments  require  a 
Test every 2 hours.

Cold: Your  first  failure  causes  a  penalty  of  –10  Ballistic  Skill, 
Agility  and  Dexterity.  The  second  failure  reduces  all  other 
Characteristics by –10. Third and subsequent failures cause 1d10 
Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 
Wound lost. If you reach zero Wounds, you immediately take an 
Unconscious condition. Certain Trappings provide bonuses and 
penalties to these Tests. See pages 302 and 309.

Heat:  Your  first  failure  causes  a  penalty  of  –10  to  Intelligence 
and  Willpower,  and  adds  a  Fatigued  Condition.  The  second 
failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10%, and adds another 
Fatigued  Condition.  Third  and  subsequent  failures  cause  1d10 
Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 
Wound lost. Stripping off heavy Trappings cancels 1 failed test.

Thirst and Starvation
Running out of provisions can be bad. Running out of water is 
worse. Endurance Tests to withstand thirst and hunger become 
increasingly difficult (cumulative –10 for every test). Characters 
without food and water cannot heal Wounds or recover Fatigue 
naturally.

Water: Every day without water requires you make an Endurance 
test. The  first  failed Test  causes  a  penalty  of  –10  Intelligence, 
Willpower,  and  Fellowship.  Second  and  subsequent  failures 
reduce  all  Characteristics  by  –10  and  cause  1d10  Damage  not 
modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.

Further,  if  you  suffer  an  amputated  body  part,  you  cannot  heal 
1  of  the  suffered  Wounds  until  a  surgeon  successfully  treats  it 
with a Heal Test. For more information on surgery, refer to the 
Surgery talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents.

Food: Every 2 days without food require an Endurance Test. The 
first failed Tests causes a penalty of –10 Strength and Toughness. 
Second and subsequent failures reduce all other Characteristics 
by –10 and cause 1d10 Damage not modified by Armour Points, 
with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.

coRRuPtion

Every Festag, Sigmarite priests preach from high pulpits about 
the dangers of the Ruinous Powers, about how good folk must 
avoid the temptations of daemons whispering from every shadow. 
They declare all souls are in perpetual peril, mere footsteps from 
falling to corruption and mutation. And they might be right.

Corruption points are used to show the slow, gradual slip of your 
soul to the Dark Gods of Chaos. Whenever you are exposed to a 
potential source of corruption, you may accrue Corruption points. 
The more you have, the closer you are drawing to Chaos, and the 
darker your soul becomes until, eventually, you change…

optIons:
encroachInG darKness…
some  inventive  players  prefer  to  embellish  their  dark  deals 
with  disturbing  events  happening  in-game.  If  you  like  the 
sound of this, it’s up to you how such events should manifest, 
but  tailoring  them  to  the  story  of  the  character  involved  is 
always a good idea. Perhaps taint subtly influences the local 
area causing animals to flee or plants to gently rot? 

perhaps  you  could  roll  on  the  miscast  table  from  chapter 
8:  magic  to  create  a  random  event  (especially  appropriate 
for wizards and witches)? think of the test tied to the dark 
deed, and then consider soul-staining events that could occur 
to ensure your success.

Corrupting Influences
Corruption  points  are  usually  gained  by  exposure  to  a  place, 
person,  or  object  tainted  by  Chaos,  or  to  a  situation  especially 
beloved to one of the Dark Gods. 

If you encounter a corrupting influence, attempt a Challenging 
(+0)  Endurance  Test,  or  Challenging  (+0)  Cool  Test,  as 
determined by the GM — usually physical influences are resisted 
with Endurance, spiritual corruption is resisted with Cool. 

The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL you will need 
to avoid it. The following provides some examples of corrupting 
influences  with  the  number  of  SL  needed  to  completely  avoid 
Corruption points.

gaining CoRRUpTion poinTs
During play, there are two primary routes to gaining corruption: 
dark deals and corrupting influences.

Minor Exposure
These  corrupting  influences,  although  relatively  trivial,  still 
endanger  a  weak  soul.  If  a Test  is  failed  to  resist  such  a  minor 
exposure, gain 1 Corruption point.

Dark Deals
Sometimes, you just have to succeed. Most commonly this means 
passing an important Test. Should such a Test fail, you can use 
a Fortune point to reroll the Test, hopefully passing the second 
time. But what if it fails again? Or you have no Fortune points 
remaining? Then it’s time for a dark deal.

You can purposefully choose to take a Corruption point to reroll 
a Test, even if it has been rerolled already. This is always a choice 
for you, not the GM — although there is nothing wrong with 
the GM gently reminding you that you could try again. After all, 
what’s the worst that could happen?

•	 Witness a Lesser Daemon.
•	 Contact with a Mutant, refined Warpstone, or Chaos-

tainted artefact.

•	 Giving in to despair, rage, excess, or the need to change

•	

your lot.
Being near Warpstone.
Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshippers, Chaos Cult 
Temples, Skaven, Mutant Lairs, and similar.

Moderate Exposure
Moderate  corrupting  influences  are  a  danger  to  every  soul  and 
should  be  avoided  under  all  circumstances.  If  a  Test  is  failed,

On a Success (2+), you gain no Corruption points.•	Witness multiple Daemons.•	Contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact.•	Embracing despair, rage, excess, or the desire to become someone new.•	Prolonged exposure to refined Warpstone.•	Brief exposure to an environment steeped with Dhar, dark magic used by Necromancers and Chaos Sorcerers.Major ExposureIf you find yourself confronted with a major corrupting influence, flee. Stay for too long, and you may never be the same again. For each failed Test to resist a major exposure, gain 3 Corruption points. If you pass with a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 2 Corruption points. On a Success (2–3), you gain 1 Corruption point. Only if you score an Impressive Success (4+), do you gain no Corruption points.•	Witness a Greater Daemon.•	Prolonged contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact.•	Making a deal with a Daemon.•	Consuming refined Warpstone.•	Prolonged exposure to an environment steeped with dhar (see Magic for more on this).CorruptingNo-one is left unscathed by exposure to the Ruinous Powers. Eventually, even the strongest fall, their mind and bodies twisting into new unrecognisable forms.Should you ever gain more Corruption points than your Willpower Bonus plus your Toughness Bonus, immediately attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test. If passed, you have managed to hold off your corruption for now but will have to Test again next time you gain Corruption Points. If you fail, then either your body or mind is about to mutate.Dissolution of Body and MindAs corruption ravages your soul, the warping breath of Chaos whispers within, either fanning your flesh into a fresh, new form, or fracturing your psyche with exquisite knowledge it can never unlearn.First, lose Corruption points equal to your Willpower Bonus as you mutate. Next, roll percentile dice and refer to the following table to determine whether it’s your body or your mind that blossoms anew.ElfHalflingHumanDwarfBody–01–1001–5001–05Mind01–10011–10051–10006–100Now roll on either the Physical Corruption Table (page 184) or the Mental Corruption Table (page 185) to see what happens. Corruption LimitsA soul can only withstand so much corruption before it collapses upon itself, leaving a mutated, gibbering mess. Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods. At this point, it’s time to create a new character. Your current one is now damned, becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may well see the wretched creature again…Losing Corruption pointsOnce the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul, removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible. Beyond the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution.Dark WhispersEven considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another, is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous. But reach out they do.The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions. The choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree, you lose 1 Corruption Point. Examples of what may be asked include:•	Letting an enemy escape.•	‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally.•	Falling asleep on watch.Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul.V

Be very careFul
used sparingly, corruption points are great fun as Faustian deals are made for rerolls and traded back for memorable roleplaying 
moments as minor betrayals spread, but if you’re playing with a group that doesn’t readily understand the old World, the points can 
accrue very quickly, sending characters into a spiral of mutation and madness. this should probably be avoided. mutation is effectively 
a death sentence if discovered, so it’s important new players are cautioned when their actions may lead to corruption. Just like every 
child in the empire is warned of the dangers posed by the ruinous powers, players should be warned that Warpstone should not be 
touched or even approached, that tainted artefacts are dangerous, and the cultists of chaos should be avoided at all costs. of course, 
the circumstances of the adventure at hand may force your group into the most horrendous situations with corruption around every 
corner, but that’s WFRP.

Absolution
As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the 
Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may 
lead you to seek absolution. But simply asking forgiveness from 
a  local  preacher  won’t  be  enough. The  stain  of  the  Dark  Gods’ 
touch  isn’t  so  easily  scrubbed  clean. The  exact  limits  of  what  is 
required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM, 
but it is rarely, if ever, simple. 

Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can 
be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution, 
consider the following.

•	 Cleanse  a  profane  temple  to  the  Dark  Gods. Though  the 

very act may expose you to more corruption…

•	 Complete  a  holy  pilgrimage  and  receive  a  blessing  from  a 
high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey.

•	 Destroy  an  unholy  artefact,  or  otherwise  render  it  safe, 

•	

foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods.
Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods 
opposed to Chaos.

manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly, 
but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch, 
patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into 
a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset. If 
you would prefer to draw the mutation process out, perhaps to 
play upon the horror of the inevitable mutations to come, you 
are encouraged to do so. this is left in the hands of the Gm to 
detail according to individual taste and preference.

diSeASe And inFection

Plague and pestilence — the purview of Nurgle, the Chaos God 
of Disease and Despair — are an everyday fact of Old World life.
Yearly outbreaks of disease plague all levels of society, although 
the  common  folk  usually  fare  the  worst. To  ward  against  these 
terrible infections, most turn to the welcoming arms of Nurgle’s 
sworn enemy, Shallya, the Goddess of Mercy and Healing, but 
those actually suffering a disease will often turn to any possible 
cure, ensuring wise women, herbalists, and travelling doktors are 
never  out  of  business,  even  when  most  peddle  quackery  rather 
than true remedies.

symptoms, and how they affect a character.

•	 Permanent: some diseases are so horrendous they carry 
permanent consequences. this section is only included 
if the affliction has such long-term effects.

Blood Rot
Your very blood is diseased, and your heart now pumps sickness 
through  your  body.  Leeching  the  rot  is  the  accepted  cure,  but 
some doktors instead cut careful incisions near the neck to free 
the  contaminated  blood,  demanding  the  patient  ingest  of  vast 
quantities of healthy blood to replace what is lost. Whether the 
patient accepts such remedies or not, without treatment, Blood 
Rot is deadly, and will likely end in a visit from the Mourners’ 
Guild and the Cult of Morr.

Contraction: As a development of another disease or a Critical 
Wound.
Incubation: Instant
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Blight, Fever (Severe), Malaise

The Bloody Flux
The  Bloody  Flux  is  a  persistent  problem  in  the  Empire,  and 
widely viewed to be a curse upon the impious by the Gods.  The 
foul disease causes its unfortunate victim to evacuate the bowels 
forcibly and frequently. The Bloody Flux is endemic in the State 
Armies, where it is commonly claimed to kill more soldiers than 
any enemy. Typical cures include eating blood pudding to replace 
lost humours, ‘corking’, and rubbing fats into the afflicted area to 
lessen the sting.

Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Toughness Test after an 
infected source enters the mouth.
Incubation: 2d10 days
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Flux (Severe), Lingering (Challenging), Fever, 
Malaise, Nausea

The liTany of pesTilenCe
The following offers a tiny sample of the infections, poxes, and 
plagues  festering  in  dark  corners  of  the  Old  World  and  are 
presented as inspiration for creating your own diseases.

The Black Plague
Historians  claim  that  centuries  ago  rats  swarmed  the  Empire 
and  the  Black  Plague  followed,  wiping  out  nine  in  every  ten 
souls.  Unexplained  flare-ups  of  the  horrendous  disease  still 
occur  today,  and  when  they  do,  it  always  brings  no-nonsense 
white nuns. The Cult of Shallya has sworn to do everything in 
its power to eradicate the foul disease, so, using ancient laws and 
rights granted to them, white-roped cordon sanitaires are erected 
wherever they encounter the Plague, ensuring none can leave or 
enter the quarantined area until the outbreak is contained, and all 
bodies correctly disposed.

Contraction: Enact an Average (+20) Endurance Test for each 
hour, or part thereof, spent in an area infested with infected fleas, 
or when exposed to infected fluids.
Incubation: 1d10 minutes
Duration: 3d10 days
Symptoms: Buboes, Blight (Moderate), Fever, Gangrene, Malaise

usInG dIseases
some groups love diseases as they add a grim and gritty feel 
to  their  WFRP  adventures,  and  provide  medical  characters 
in  careers  like  apothecary,  hedge  Witch,  herbalist,  and 
physician  —  not  to  mention  priests  and  Wizards  —  extra 
utility. Others find diseases useful in specific circumstances, 
perhaps  deployed  for  dramatic  effect  to  stories  including 
skaven or nurgle chaos cultists. and some WFRP gamers 
find diseases to be an easily forgotten nuisance. 

It’s up to you and your group to find the best way to include 
diseases in your game, but be aware some can be very nasty, 
and it’s never fun to have a pc stuck in bed recovering as the 
rest of the group goes adventuring, so be careful how they’re 
deployed.

r u l e s

Festering Wound
Infected  cuts  and  abrasions  are  commonplace,  meaning  many 
superstitions  exist  explaining  how  best  to  treat  them.  Poultices 
fashioned from wrapped leaves and dung, the skin of toads, and 
dove-feathers are common, as is rubbing the wound in Sigmar’s 
Good Soil. Most physicians rubbish such talk, and prefer more 
scientific  curatives,  such  as  mixing  the  gall  of  a  black  ox  with 
three spoonfuls of the patient’s urine and half a spoon of sea salt, 
which  is  then  rubbed  into  the  festering,  pus-filled  wound. The 
screams this elicits prove just how effective the remedy is.

Contraction: If  you  fail  an  Easy (+40) Endurance Test  after  a 
combat with a creature with the Infected trait (see Bestiary). You 
can also develop a Festering Wound from a Minor Infection.
Incubation: 1d10 days, or instantly if developed from another 
symptom.
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Fever, Lingering (Challenging), Malaise, Wounded

Galloping Trots
It is said Halfling food won’t give you Galloping Trots, a messy 
affliction all too common in the Empire given just how little care 
is  given  to  the  proper  preparation  of  food,  but  those  suffering 
‘Rumster’s Revenge’ from the cheap, Halfling pies on sale across 
Altdorf, would disagree, assuming they could escape the privy for 
long enough…

Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Toughness Test after an 
infected source enters the mouth.
Incubation: 1d10 hours
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Flux (Moderate), Malaise, Nausea

Itching Pox
Annual outbreaks of Itching Pox afflict most towns and cities of 
the Empire. The disease, which causes body-wide itchy blisters, 
is relatively mild, and very rarely has lasting complications, so it 
concerns few outside worried parents or vain nobles. So common 
is  it,  that  most  temples  of  Shallya  have  vials  of  white  paste  on 
hand to relieve the itching of the afflicted.

Contraction: If you fail an Average (+20) Endurance Test when 
contact is made with an infected individual or fail the same Test 
when an infected individual coughs or sneezes in your immediate 
vicinity (at a rate of about one Test per hour of exposure).
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 1d10+7 days
Symptoms: Coughs and Sneezes, Pox
Permanent: Once the disease is contracted, you become 
immune to catching it again.

Minor Infection
Minor  infections  —  slow-healing  wounds  with  a  modicum  of 
swelling and heat — are extremely common. Most heal of their 
own accord in time, so few worry about them until it’s too late, 
and Morr’s Portal opens.

Contraction: If you fail a Very Easy (+60) Endurance Test after 
a combat where you suffered a Critical Wound.
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Lingering (Easy), Malaise, Wounded

Packer’s Pox
A  common  infection  amongst  hunters,  furriers,  and  traders, 
Packer’s  Pox  is  contracted  from  infected  cattle  and  sheep, 
including  their  hides  and  wool,  and  from  the  bodies  of  those 
killed by the disease. It starts as a small itchy rash, but soon pink, 
depressed blisters spread across the whole body, concentrating on 
the torso and arms. Not the worst of the various poxes plaguing 
the  Empire,  but  it  does  linger  for  a  very  long  time,  and  can 
occasionally turn deadly.

Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Endurance Test after any 
contact with infected animals, hides, or bodies.
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 5d10 days
Symptoms: Lingering (Challenging), Pox

Ratte Fever
Contracted  from  infected  rodents,  dreaded  Ratte  Fever  brings 
inflamed rashes and ulcerations before a fever rises and the body 
begins  to  spasm. Though  rarely  fatal,  it’s  a  debilitating  disease, 
and  it  takes  a  long  time  to  recover,  so  most  are  willing  to  try 
anything  to  lessen  the  symptoms.  Common  remedies  include 
self-flagellation in Altdorf — which reputedly does bring some 
relief  to  the  skin  infections  —  and  smearing  oneself  in  goat-
cheese mixed with imported Kislevite ice-peppers in Talabheim. 
In the bigger towns and cities, Ratte Fever is also known as Pie 
Fever given just how many savoury pasties contain tainted rat in 
place of more expensive meat.

sympToms
This  section  explains  how  the  symptoms  for  each  infection 
manifests. Use them to create your own disgusting diseases.

stIrrInG nurGle’s cauldron
nurgle,  the  chaos  God  of  pestilence  and  decay,  keeps  a 
bubbling cauldron in the foulest corner of its rotting garden, 
within  which  is  brewed  every  plague  that  ever  was,  or  ever 
will be. And there is no reason you can’t do the same! The 
twelve symptoms provided here are a perfect start for creating 
your own foul diseases. all you need do is think of a nasty 
infection, figure out how it’s contracted, decide how long it 
lasts, then assign a few symptoms.

say  you  wanted  to  create  a  disease  called Weevil cough. 
you first decide how it’s contracted (from exposure to those 
already infected, or to mites in hay, wheat, and flour, requiring 
an Average (+20) endurance test to avoid), then how long its 
Incubation  and  duration  is  (say,  1d10  days  for  each),  then 
assign Symptoms (Coughs and Sneezes, and Malaise). Done!

Blight
You are seriously ill and perhaps close to Morr’s Portal as deadly 
poisons flood your body.

Pass  a  Very  Easy  (+60)  Endurance  daily  (normally  when  you 
sleep) or die, passing away, perhaps in your sleep, perhaps lost in 
a fever, perhaps in agony. If Blight is marked as (Moderate), this 
Test  is  Easy  (+40);  if  marked  as  (Severe),  this Test  is  Average 
(+20).

Treatment: None that work.

Buboes
You  have  huge  swellings  of  the  lymph  nodes,  possibly  in  the 
groin,  neck  or  armpits. These  are  enormously  painful  and  may 
bleed or seep pus. They are disgusting, smelly, and some would 

argue a sure sign of the Lord of Pestilence’s favour, believing they 
hide tiny, growing Daemons. Common practice is to lance these 
terrible  expressions  of  taint  to  remove  whatever  nestles  within, 
though doing so often results in Festering Wounds.

Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests, and to all Fellowship 
Tests if the buboes can be seen (or smelled!).

Treatment:  A  successful  Heal  Test  with  Surgery  can  lance 
your  buboes,  removing  the  penalty.  If  the Test  is  failed,  gain  a 
Festering Wound.  If  your  Buboes  are  lanced,  make  a  Difficult 
(–10) Endurance Test once per day or more swell into place.

Convulsions
Your  body  periodically  spasms  or  shakes  as  the  infection 
seemingly uses you like a puppet.

Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests as your body convulses 
beyond your control. If this symptom is marked as (Moderate), 
the  penalty  increases  to  –20.  If  it  is  marked  as  (Severe),  you 
need to be tied down in order not to hurt yourself, leaving you 
effectively incapacitated.

Treatment:  Rare  herbs  and  alchemical  mixes  can  lessen  this 
symptom  for  a  day,  bringing  Severe  down  to  Moderate,  and 
Moderate down to standard convulsions. These can be created by 
any with the Trade (Apothecary) skill and access to the appropriate 
ingredients (which can cost upwards of 10 shillings or more per 
dose). The final medicine is Rare and usually genuine (80%), and 
can  be  bought  for  around  1  GC  per  dose  from  Apothecaries, 
putting it beyond the reach of most citizens of the Empire.

Coughs and Sneezes
You intermittently cough or sneeze, spreading your disease to all 
around you. Any characters in your environment are exposed to 
the  disease  you  carry,  and  need Test  for  Contraction  once  per 
hour, or part thereof, of exposure. 

Treatment: None that work.

Fever
Your  temperature  is  high,  you’re  likely  sweating,  and  you  really 
don’t look at all well. Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical and 
Fellowship  Tests.  If  your  Fever  is  marked  as  (Severe),  it  has 
completely incapacitated you, leaving you bed-ridden. Take the 
Unconscious Condition, though expenditure of a Resolve point 
can bring consciousness for a few minutes. 

Treatment: There are many common, often disgusting, remedies 
for a fever, most of which don’t work (only 10% of commercial 
cures are genuine). A successful Heal Test does little more that 
inform  you  how  long  the  fever  will  likely  last. The  cures  range 
from a few pennies to many shillings in cost. If genuine, they will 
remove the symptoms of a Fever (not a severe one) if you pass a 
Challenging (+0) Endurance Test.

Flux
There’s a rumble and a grumble, then you’re off for yet another 
sprint  to  the  splattered  outhouse.  Pale  and  weary,  you’ve  had 
better days. Any given situation may be the moment you just have 
to  go  to  the  privy.  You  are  expected  to  take  every  opportunity 
you can to pop off for an essential stop, and this is largely left in 
your  hands.  In  addition,  the  GM  can  choose  any  point  during 
the session’s play to claim you need to go. You have a number of 
rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus to get to an appropriate 
place  to  relieve  yourself;  whether  you  get  there  in  time  or  not, 
your body will empty itself in a spectacular fashion. If the Flux is 
marked as (Moderate), the GM can make you go twice a session. 
If  it  is  marked  as  (Severe),  the  GM  can  do  it  three  times,  and 
you will also lose 1 Wound per visit, as the bloody flux leaves you 
utterly drained.

Treatment: Real cures for the Flux are rare (10% of commercial 
remedies  are  genuine),  but  many  apothecaries  and  herbalists 
swear  theirs  work  every  time.  Costs  vary  widely  according  to 
where you buy the cures, from a few brass coins to small bag of 
silver.  If  genuine,  the  Flux  can  be  held  off  for  your Toughness 
Bonus in hours by taking a remedy.

Gangrene
Your flesh is turning black, dying, infected with something awful, 
and it isn’t going to get better. Roll percentile dice to determine a 
Hit Location (see Combat). If you roll Body, luckily the Gangrene 
did not settle in during this infection. If you roll Head, your nose 
is affected. If you roll Arms, it’s your fingers. If you roll Leg, it’s 
your  feet.  Each  day,  roll  an  Average  (+20)  Endurance Test.  If 
you pass, you hold off the Gangrene; if you fail, it grows worse. 
If you ever fail more times than you have Toughness Bonus, you 
completely  lose  all  capability  with  the  affected  location.  If  this 
occurs, use the same rules as Amputation (see Critical Wounds). 
For  as  long  as  you  have  Gangrene,  suffer  a  penalty  –10  to  all 
Fellowship  Tests,  and  suffer  the  Wounded  symptom.  Further, 
if  not  already  suffering  it,  you  also  suffer  from  Blight  until  the 
affected tissue is amputated; this remains even if you are cured of 
the disease that started the Gangrene. 

cure has only a 10% chance of being genuine, but if so will negate 
the need to roll the Endurance Test if taken on the correct day 
(which will require a successful Heal Test to determine).

Malaise
You don’t feel at all well. You are tired, find it hard to concentrate, 
and  just  generally  ill. Take  a Fatigued  Condition  that  you  can 
only remove when you have recovered from your illness.

Treatment: Medicine treating Malaise, costing anything from a 
few pence to a handful of silver, is usually genuine (75% chance); 
and, if so, pass a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test to ignore the 
symptom for the day.

Nausea
You  feel  very  sick  and  are  prone  to  vomiting  if  you  move 
around too quickly. Whenever you fail a Test involving physical 
movement, your nausea overwhelms you and you vomit. You gain 
the Stunned condition, which represents you being sick repeatedly 
or dry heaving, depending upon your current circumstances.

Treatment:  Remedies  for  Nausea  are  Common  and  usually 
genuine (60% chance), and typically cost around thirty pennies; 
if  genuine,  pass  a  Challenging  (+0)  Endurance  Test,  and  the 
Nausea  can  be  ignored  for  a  number  of  hours  equal  to  your 
Toughness Bonus.

Pox
You  are  covered  in  pustules,  inflamed  swellings,  disgusting 
rashes,  or  itchy  spots,  which  are  unlikely  to  be  your  most 
attractive feature. Pox are largely a cosmetic issue, resulting in a 
penalty of –10 to Fellowship Tests. Additionally, remember to 
roleplay and describe all the scratching; if you want to withhold 
from this for a while, pass an Average (+20) Cool Test. When 
the Pox ends, attempt an Average (+20) Cool Test. If this fails, 
reverse the Test dice and apply permanent scarring to that Hit 
Location,  showing  an  area  where  you  scratched  and  the  pox 
there healed badly. If the Hit Location is the head, permanently 
lose 1 in Fellowship. See Combat for more on Hit Locations. 

Treatment: Amputation of the gangrenous location is the only 
effective treatment.

Lingering
You  have  an  infection  that  just  refuses  to  go  away.  Indeed, 
you  fear  it  may  be  getting  worse…  After  your  disease  reaches 
the  end  of  its  duration,  attempt  an  Endurance  Test  with  the 
Difficulty marked on the symptom like so: Lingering (Average) 
or  Lingering  (Easy).  If  this  scores  a  Marginal  Failure  (0),  the 
duration extends for an extra 1d10 days. If it scores a Failure (–2), 
develop a Festering Wound. On an Astounding Failure (–6), you 
instead develop Blood Rot.

Treatment:  Cures  for  lingering  infections  are  commonplace 
and usually relatively cheap, rarely costing more than a shilling. 
However, almost all are fake or based on faulty lore. Any bought 

Treatment: Poxes are exceedingly common, and so are remedies, 
which  are  usually  creams  or  oils.  Larger  temples  of  Shallya 
often keep a stock of the cream for free (though donations are 
expected) and apothecaries and herbalists of all kinds sell similar 
products for relatively low prices (rarely more than six or seven 
pence  for  a  week’s  worth  of  treatment,  with  a  90%  chance  of 
being genuine medicine). Using a cream increases all Cool Tests 
to resist scratching to Very Easy (+60), but is usually unsightly.

Wounded
You  have  a  wound  or  open  sore  that  does  not  heal  properly 
because of an infection. For each Wounded symptom you have, 
you cannot heal one of your Wounds, which stays open and sore, 
possibly seeping foul-smelling pus. Every day, take an Easy (+20) 
Endurance Test or gain a Festering Wound if you do not already 
have one.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Treatment:  A  daily  successful  Heal  Test  ensures  the  Wound 
is  clean  and  does  not  require  an  Endurance Test  to  be  further 
infected.

PSychology

Our emotions and instincts have a powerful impact on how we 
react in certain circumstances. These rules bring another level of 
drama to your game and help bring the Old World’s inhabitants 
to life.

psyChology TesT
If you are exposed to one of the following Psychological traits, you 
may resist its effects by passing a Cool Test at the beginning of 
the Round, with the Difficulty set by the GM. A successful Test 
lasts until the end of the current encounter, although additional 
Tests may be required if circumstances change.

Example:  Brokk  has  Animosity  (Elves). When  the Dwarf 
encounters some haughty Elves quaffing wine and laughing 
loudly in a tavern, he Tests his Cool to control himself; he passes, 
so is not subject to Animosity, though he does choose to spit on 
the ground as he passes the sneering things. Later, when one of 
the Elves jostles his arm, spilling his ale, his GM asks Brokk to 
Test again. This time he fails. So, setting down his tankard, he 
turns around to ‘have a word’ with the offending Elf, unable to 
stop himself from launching into a tirade about exactly what he 
thinks of their so-called nimbleness!

psyChologiCal TRaiTs
The following are the most common Psychology traits in WFRP.

Animosity (Target)
You harbour an enmity for the Target, which will normally be a 
group  of  people  or  creatures,  such  as ‘Nordlanders’, ‘Beastmen’, 
or ‘Nobles’. You must attempt a Psychology Test whenever you 
encounter the group. If you pass, you may grumble and spit, but 
only suffer a penalty of –20 to all Fellowship Tests towards that 
group. Should you fail you are subject to Animosity. 

At the end of every subsequent Round, you may attempt another 
Psychology  test  to  bring  the Animosity  to  an  end.  If  you  do 
not, the effects of Animosity naturally come to an end when all 
members of the specified group in your line of sight are utterly 
pacified  or  gone,  or  you  gain  the  Stunned  or  Unconscious 
Condition, or you become subject to another Psychology.

When  subject  to Animosity,  you  must  immediately  attack  the 
disagreeable creatures, either socially (insults, jibes, and similar) 
or physically (most commonly with fists), as appropriate. You also 
gain  a  bonus  of  +1  SL  on  any  attempts  to  socially  or  mentally 
attack the group. Animosity is over-ridden by Fear and Terror.

Fear (Rating)
The  Fear  trait  represents  an  extreme  aversion  to  something. 
Creatures that cause Fear have a Fear Rating; this value reflects 
the SL you are required to pass on an Extended Cool Test to 
overcome  your  Fear.  You  may  continue  to  Test  at  the  end  of 
every round until your SL equals or surpasses the creature’s Fear 
rating. Until you do this, you are subject to Fear.

When  subject  to Fear,  you  suffer  –1  SL  on  all  Tests  to  affect 
the source of your fear. You may not move closer to whatever is 
causing Fear without passing a Challenging (+0) Cool Test. If it 
comes closer to you, you must pass a Challenging (+0) Cool Test, 
or gain a Broken Condition.

Frenzy
With  a  Willpower  Test,  you  can  work  yourself  into  a  state  of 
frenzy  by  psyching  yourself  up,  howling,  biting  your  shield,  or 
similar.  If you succeed, you become subject to Frenzy.

While subject to Frenzy you are immune to all other psychology, 
and  will  not  flee  or  retreat  for  any  reason;  indeed  you  must 
always move at full rate towards the closest enemy you can see 
in order to attack. Generally, the only Action you may take is 
a  Weapon  Skill  Test  or  an  Athletics  Test  to  reach  an  enemy 
more quickly. Further, you may take a Free Action Melee Test 
each Round as you are throwing everything you have into your 
attacks. Lastly, you gain a bonus of +1 Strength Bonus, such is 
your ferocity. You remain in Frenzy until all enemies in your line 
of sight are pacified, or you receive the Stunned or Unconscious 
condition. After your Frenzy is over you immediately receive a 
Fatigued condition. 

Hatred (Target)
You  are  consumed  with  Hatred  for  the  Target,  which  is 
normally a group of people or creatures, such as ‘Hochlanders’, 
‘Bog  Octopuses’,  or  ‘Slavers’.  You  will  never  socially  interact 
with  someone  or  something  you  hate  in  this  manner.  On 
encountering  the  object  of  your Hatred,  you  must  attempt  a 
Psychology  Test.  If  failed,  you  are  subject  to Hatred.  At  the 
end  of  every  subsequent  Round,  you  may  attempt  another 
Psychology Test  to  bring  the Hatred  to  an  end.  If  you  do  or 
not,  the  effects  of Hatred  naturally  come  to  an  end  when  all 
members of the specified group in your line of sight are dead 
or gone, or you gain the Unconscious condition. While subject 
to Hatred, you must immediately attempt to destroy the hated 
group by the fastest and most deadly means possible. You gain a 
bonus of +1 SL on all combat Tests against the specified group, 
and are immune to Fear and Intimidate (but not Terror) caused 
by your hated foe. 

Prejudice (Target)
You really dislike the Target, which is normally a group of people 
or creatures such as ‘Ostlanders’, ‘Elves’, or ‘Wizards’. You must 
attempt  a  Psychology  Test  whenever  you  encounter  the  group 
against which you are prejudiced. If you pass, you may frown a lot, 
but will otherwise act normally, only suffering a penalty of –10 to 

190

r u l e s

V

all Fellowship Tests towards that group. Should you fail you are 
subject to Prejudice. At the end of every subsequent Round, you 
may attempt another Psychology test to bring the Prejudice to an 
end. If you do not, the effects of Prejudice naturally come to an 
end when all members of the specified group in your line of sight 
are gone, or you gain the Stunned or Unconscious Condition, or 
you become subject to another Psychology.

When  subject  to Prejudice,  you  must  immediately  insult  the 
target of your prejudice. Loudly.

Terror (Rating)
Some creatures are so profoundly unsettling as to provoke a dire, 
bone-chilling  terror  in  their  foes.  When  you  first  encounter  a 
creature causing Terror, make a Cool Test. If you pass, you suffer 
no further effects of Terror; if you fail, you receive a number of 
Broken conditions equal to the creature’s Terror Rating, plus the 
number of SL below 0. 

After  resolving  the  Psychology  Test,  the  creature  causes Fear, 
with a Fear Rating equal to its Terror Rating.

You must come to their aid if the group is threatened physically 
or socially, and you gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Tests to defend 
or support the group.

Example: Amhold had a difficult childhood, growing up on the 
streets without a family. Despite his gruff demeanour, he has 
Camaraderie (Orphans).

Example: Love
Poets write endlessly of love, and every minstrel of the Reikland 
knows  dozens  of  songs  praising  the  power  of  love.  If  your 
character has the Love trait towards one or more individuals, this 
reflects a deep and enduring emotional connection. This may be 
the intense romantic love for a wife, husband, or lover, a strong 
familial love for a sibling, parent, or child, or an especially strong 
friendship. 

You  must  come  to  the  aid  of  someone  you  love  if  they  are 
threatened  physically  or  socially.  You  are  immune  to Fear  and 
Intimidation  while  defending  your  loved  ones,  and  you  gain  a 
bonus +1 SL to all related Tests.

CUsTom psyChology
You can create your own psychological traits to reflect the events 
of your game. This is something that will vary depending on your 
group,  and  the  style  of  game  you  choose  to  play.  It  is  also  an 
area that should be treated sensitively, and if in any doubt avoid 
anything that could upset a member of the group.

In addition to the mechanical effects of these custom traits, they 
are  a  wonderful  opportunity  for  roleplaying;  taking  on  custom 
psychological  traits  allows  you  to  show  off  or  practice  your 
roleplaying skills, and maybe earn some extra XP. See Advances 
in Chapter 2: Character for more about this.

When  making  custom  traits,  you  should  consider  both  what 
provokes the trait to manifest, and what the effect will be. Will 
it make the character immune to some, or all other psychology 
traits?  Will  it  offer  a  bonus  in  some  situations?  A  penalty  in 
others?  As  always,  your  GM  is  the  ultimate  arbiter  in  this 
situation. Sample bonuses or penalties a Psychological trait may 
offer include:

+1/–1 SL to specified Tests
Immunity to specified psychological traits
Prescribed or Proscribed Actions and Moves

•	
•	
•	
•	 Gaining Conditions

The following are some examples of custom traits to inspire your 
own. 

Example: Camaraderie
Camaraderie  reflects  positive  feelings  towards  a  group  of 
individuals. 

Example: Rilla is a riverwoman and travels the Reik with her 
close-knit family. She has Love (Son), Love (Brother) and Love 
(Parents). You mess with Rilla’s family, you mess with Rilla!

Example: Phobia
A  phobia  reflects  a  specific  fear;  it  may  be  towards  a  type  of 
creature, or towards a particular object or circumstance, such as 
Phobia (Insects), Phobia (Books), or Phobia (Confined Spaces). 
Treat the object of the Phobia as causing Fear 1. You may want 
to increase the Fear rating if the Phobia is especially powerful.

Example: Doktor Johannsen is a renowned antiquarian. Despite 
his many adventures and tales of derring-do, he suffers from 
Phobia (Snakes); no matter this aversion, he seems to encounter 
them with alarming regularity. 

Example: Trauma
The life of most Reiklanders is nasty, brutish and short: that goes 
double for adventurers, whose lives are often especially traumatic. 
Everyone  processes  trauma  differently,  and  you  may  choose  to 
reflect  that  in  a  range  of  different  ways:  nightmares,  substance 
abuse, flashbacks, Animosity or Hatred towards a particular group, 
or a Phobia. A character who has suffered a traumatic experience 
may manifest that in a range of different ways over time.

Example: Horst’s village was destroyed in a terrible fire – he 
can still hear their screams at night. If Horst sees any characters 
— friend or foe — with the Ablaze Condition, he must make 
a Challenging (+0) Cool Test. If he fails, he receives a Stunned 
Condition, plus one additional Stunned Condition for each SL 
below 0. Additionally, every night Horst makes an  Easy  (+40) 
Cool Test; if he fails, he suffers nightmares and gains the Fatigued 
Condition.

‘of course there is something wrong with us. this world has more 
than enough sorrow and pain to go about. so, what do we do? 
We seek out things that even the courageous fear and confront 
them in the dark. truly, we are the favoured pawns of the Gods. 
so: what do I do with my time when I’m not on some foolish 
quest? I drink.’

– lieselotte aderhold, adventurer

It may take many game sessions, but eventually all adventures 
come to an end. When this happens, you may have weeks where 
your  character  has  nothing  to  do  before  the  next  adventure 
begins.  This  chapter  provides  tools  to  quickly  detail  what 
happens in this downtime.

To begin, you will randomise an Event. You will then spend any 
money you acquired on your last escapade, and engage in a variety 
of activities called Endeavours, ranging from commonplace tasks 
— such as working a trade, or managing their affairs — to more 
specialised undertakings — such as consulting a sage or attempting 
to  learn  a  new  skill.  Once  this  is  concluded,  you’ll  resolve  any 
matters that arise from your choices,  and  are  then  ready  to start 
your next adventure.

optIons: It’s all optIonal 
every rule in this chapter is optional. some will love the quick 
rules it offers to explain events between adventures, others will 
prefer to detail this time fully with roleplay, seeing it as as an 
opportunity to give depth to characters or to pursue leads and 
ideas that could become adventures in their own right. there 
is no right or wrong way. treat this chapter as a source of 
inspiration and do your own thing!

eventS

Before  selecting  your  Endeavours,  you  first  roll  1d100  on  the 
Events table opposite. Some Events will only affect you, others 
may affect the whole party.

evenTs TaBle

VI

01–03: Accused Ally
One of your allies (GM’s choice) is implicated in a terrible 
crime. A character with a Law Guild Licence can spend an 
Endeavour  to  free  the  ally  with  a  successful  Average  (+20) 
Lore (Law) test. Otherwise, 3 Endeavours spent by the party 
will exonerate their ally (or, if guilty, manufacture an alibi). If 
the ally is freed, gain a Major Favour (see Do Me a Favour 
Endeavour on page 198) for future use. If not, their ally hangs!

04–06: Arcane Auction
The  belongings  of  a  recently  deceased  neighbour  are 
auctioned,  including  a  dusty,  old  book  of  unknown  origin. 
If  you  are  able  to  pay  the  10  GC  asking  price,  the  book  is 
yours!  Beyond  any  other  advantage  the  book  may  bring  as 
determined by the GM, any Academic characters attempting 
the Research Lore Endeavour gains +20 on the Test.

26–29: False Silver
To  the  horror  of  the  merchants,  a  run  of  counterfeit  coins 
plagues the characters’ locale. A fifth of all coins are affected. 
Characters who undertake the Banking Endeavour will lose 
20% of money banked, and characters undertaking the Income 
Endeavour similarly reduce any money earned by 20%. 

30–33: Flowing Profit
Business is particularly good for folk involved in river trade. 
All  Riverfolk  make  an  additional  50%  from  any Income 
Endeavour pursued during the next batch of Endeavours.

34–36: Forewarned is Forearmed
You are given a cryptic omen by a dream, Strigany mystic, or 
Celestial wizard you encounter on the street. During your next 
adventure,  your  maximum  Fortune  points  are  increased  by  1. 

07–10: Betrayed!
A  friend,  family  member,  or  ally  turns  on  you,  the 
ramifications  of  which  will  impact  your  next  adventure. 
If  you  have  no  friends,  family,  or  allies,  your  time  between 
adventures is blissfully uneventful though somewhat dull.

37–40: Festivities
A celebration is called! Decide the nature of the event with 
the  GM.  Possibilities  include  a  local  wedding,  a  bountiful 
harvest, or a public execution! You are caught up in the event 
(and its aftermath) and lose an Endeavour.

11–14: Bolt from the Blue
A  lazy  ostler  didn’t  lock  the  stable  door,  and  your  mount 
bolted! If you succeed at an Average (+20) Animal Training 
(Horse) Test, your well-trained beast returns to the hand that 
feeds it. If you fail, your steed is gone, unlikely to be ever seen 
again. If you don’t have a mount, you have developed a painful 
new blister on your foot. 

15–18: Oi! You spilled my pint!
A petty argument in the local area has developed into a feud – 
the GM decides who you offended and how. This person will 
not pass up an opportunity for petty revenge, probably during 
the next adventure...

19–21: Crime Crackdown
The  Watch  is  cracking  down  on  crime  hard.  Rogues  can 
get  no  funds  from  the Income  Endeavour,  and  if  Rogues 
undertake  a Banking  Endeavour,  they  may  only  select  a 
High-risk deposit, as legitimate banking houses won’t handle 
dirty money. 

22–25: The Exciseman Cometh
An  unexpected  visit  by  the  tax  collector  (with  several 
soldiers  in  tow)  sweeps  through  your  local  settlement.  All 
characters lose 30% of their funds before any can be spent 
on Endeavours.

41–44: Inclement Weather
Particularly bad weather arrives. For the next adventure, all 
social Skill Tests suffer a penalty of –10 (everyone is in a foul 
mood) and food prices increase by 20% (due to spoiling of 
stored provender).

45–48: Glorious Weather
Beautiful conditions inspire you and give you cheer. You can 
add a new Short-term Ambition. When it’s concluded, you 
do not replace it with a new one.

49–52: Local Crop Failure
Food  becomes  exceedingly  scarce  and  many  folk  suffer 
terribly. Characters from the Peasant class cannot undertake 
the Income Endeavour, and food prices are doubled in the 
area for the duration of the next adventure. 

53–56: Malicious Malady
The Bloody Flux sweeps through town. Make an Easy (+40) 
Toughness  Test.  On  a  success,  the  Flux  passes  by.  On  a 
failure, you and the Washers Guild are soon to know each 
other very well. Contract the Bloody Flux see page 186.

57–60: Monstrous Complications
A monster (chosen by the GM from Chapter 12: Bestiary) 
is  causing  panic  among  the  locals. The Income  Endeavour 
provides no funds until the beast is dealt with. The characters 

193

VI

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

can choose to each sacrifice one Endeavour to deal with the 
menace  (and  this  encounter  should  be  roleplayed).  If  you 
succeed, you gain a free Income Endeavour to represent their 
individual rewards, and a feast is held in their honour. If not, 
or if the party chooses to ignore the creature, it will move on 
or be killed by a local rival.

61–63: Morr’s Embrace
One  of  the  character’s  relatives,  friends,  or  allies  dies.  It 
could be of natural causes, an accident, or the beginning of 
something sinister… 

64–65: New Moon
The  nights  are  particularly  dark.  All  Rogue  characters 
undertaking the Income Endeavour receive a +20% bonus to 
their monies earned. 

66–67: Old Debts
You  have  a Major  or Significant Favour  called  in.  Dealing 
with the favour will be part of your next adventure and you 
lose one Endeavour in preparation for what is to come.

68–69: Opportunity Saunters Through
Passing  soldiers,  well-heeled  merchants,  or  vacationing 
nobles pass through the area, and characters willing to suck 
up reap the benefits. Burgher and Peasant Class characters 
gain +50% money from the Income Endeavour. 

70–71: Peace and Quiet
It’s  times  like  these  that  remind  you  what  life  is  all  about: 
good sleep and fine cheese. Be smugly content at the start of 
your next adventure.

72–73: Pedlar
A  wizened,  well-travelled  pedlar  who  likes  a  gossip  passes 
through. For the price of a flagon of ale — 3d — you receive 
a +10 bonus to any Latest News Endeavours you attempt. 

74–76: Pestilential Pet
One  of  your  animals  falls  ill;  make  a  Challenging  (+0) 
Animal Care Test. If successful, your beast pulls through. If 
not, the unfortunate creature dies. If you have no animals, you 
are troubled by ill omens of the GM’s creation.

77–79: Ransacked
Before you can undertake a Banking Endeavour, your stash is 
raided, and all your money is taken. If your money amounts 
to less than 1 GC, the thieves also steal your most highly-
valued trapping.

80–82: Riots
The  common  folk  are  furious  at  the  high  and  mighty! 

Characters  of  the  Courtier  Class  cannot  take  the Income 
Endeavour  as,  no  matter  how  many  bodyguards  they  hire, 
it isn’t even vaguely safe for them to be abroad on business. 
Further, any deposits at reputable banks (see page 196) must 
immediately check to see if the violence and disruption has 
caused  their  bank  to  go  out  of  business.  However,  players 
attempting a Foment Dissent Endeavour receive +10 bonus 
to all related Tests.

83–85: Sticky Fingers
Your purse is cut! You lose half of the money you ended the 
last adventure with. 

86–88: Suspicion of Heresy
You fall foul of a Witch Hunter who suspects you have been 
consorting  with  Mutants,  Cultists,  or  worse  on  your  so-
called ‘adventures’.  It  takes  a  Very Hard (-30) Charm Test 
to convince the hunter you are innocent. Failure to do this 
means you have earned an implacable nemesis who is certain 
to cause trouble in the future… 

89–91: Under Suspicion
The  party’s  irregular  movements  and  sudden  wealth  has 
drawn suspicion. All characters must forfeit one Endeavour 
laying  low  or  proving  their  innocence.  Characters  in  the 
Rogue  class  cannot  use  the Income  Endeavour  until  after 
their next adventure.  

92–94: Uneventful
Little of interest occurs, perhaps leaving you with a boredom-
inspired appetite for taking risks!

95–97: Unexpected Esteem 
Someone you helped in the past has a chance to repay your 
efforts. The precise nature of the reward should be appropriate 
to your past deeds, and the NPCs you have assisted during 
play or in your back story. The tokens of gratitude may vary 
from a single high-quality item, to a purse of silver (which 
will be available at the start of the next adventure). Of course, 
all  that  glitters  is  not  gold,  and  not  all  gifts  are  what  they 
appear…

98–00: Unusual Mercenaries
One or more rare mercenaries turn up in a nearby settlement 
looking for work: a Tilean Duellist of great repute, the so-
called  Birdmen  of  Catrazza,  unemployed  Ogres  under  the 
command of a Halfling captain, or other unlikely bands. The 
mercenaries will gladly train any character in any martial Skills 
or Talents, at a 20% reduction in costs, should the characters 
undertake  a  Training  or  Unusual  Learning  Endeavour. 
Additionally, any characters undertaking a Combat Training 
Endeavour gain a +20 bonus to any relevant Test.

endeAvouRS

In-between  adventures,  you  have  a  selection  of  activities  you 
can  undertake  —  these  are  known  as  Endeavours.  You  may 
undertake  a  maximum  of  one  Endeavour  per  week  you  are 
not  adventuring,  and  you  may  attempt  a maximum of three 
Endeavours  in  total,  regardless  of  how  long  the  gap  between 
adventures may be. The rest of your time, whether it be weeks, 
months,  or  years,  is  taken  up  with  living  your  life  in  relative 
peace — whatever that may to look like to your character. 

While  most  of  these  Endeavours  can  be  attempted  by  anyone, 
some are better suited to a particular Class or Career.

year In, year out
If the period between adventures is particularly long, you can 
discuss with the Gm how to lengthen the narrative scope of 
your endeavours. For instance, if you want to commission a 
new  sword  with  the commission  Endeavour,  you  may  first 
have to find a skilled smith, then the correct materials, then 
wait for other commissions to be completed, then maybe your 
sword is stolen, and so it goes on.

money To BURn
After you’ve rolled on the Event Table, you can spend the money 
earned during your last adventures using the normal rules. Then, 
after  completing  your  Endeavours,  all  money  held  by  your 
character  is  considered  spent.  All  of  it. The  silver  lifted  from  a 
Burgher’s  purse?  Gone. The  booty  liberated  from  pirates?  Also 
gone. That Troll hoard you raided? Gone, too. All of it.

What  happened  to  it?  It  was  spent,  stolen,  drunk,  gambled, 
used  for  repairs,  to  pay  off  debts  or  taxes,  given  as  a  charitable 
donations or votive offerings, spent on bribes, or used in whatever 
other way you prefer. You should concoct the best story for what 
happens to those funds, as it explains a lot about your character.

If you want to keep some of your hard-won coin to use in the 
future, you should undertake the Banking Endeavour on page 
196. If you want money at the beginning of the next adventure — 
honestly, or otherwise, depending on your Career — you should 
undertake the Income Endeavour on page 198.

dUTies & ResponsiBiliTies
You may lose one or more of your Endeavours due to your Career 
or Species. 

With Great Power…
‘the common folk will never understand my burdens. the sheer weight 
of the duties I bear. the guilty will not judge themselves and there are 
always so many villages to cleanse, for our enemies are legion.’ 

– lothar metzger, Witch hunter 

As you climb the ranks of your career, you accrue expectations 
and  responsibilities  that  cannot  be  avoided.  Noble  Lords  must 
see to the affairs of their estates, Guildmasters must oversee their 
guild’s work, and Watch Captains must watch their watchmen. If 
you neglect your responsibilities, you will soon lose status amongst 
your peers.

If you have attained one of the top two tiers of your Career Path 
and  do  not  undertake  the Income  Endeavour,  which  reflects 
taking  care  of  your  obligations,  you  drop  one  level  within  your 
Career; reverting from the fourth level to the third, or the third 
to the second. This costs no Experience Points, acting as a free 
Career change, albeit downwards.

With this step backwards in your Career Path, you will now have 
a  lower  Status,  and  will  earn  less  money  should  you  perform 
future Income  Endeavours.  See  Chapter 3: Class and Careers 
for  more  about  Status. The  loss  in  status  does  not  remove  any 
Advances acquired while you were in your previous Career.

If you wish to reclaim your lost Career level, you must once again 
pay the XP cost to re-enter the higher level of your Career and 
retake your ‘proper’ place in society. 

Elf Improvement
‘there are times when I can barely stand altdorf. It is not the stench 
— though that is abhorrent — it is not the noise, either — it is just 
that you are all so very ugly to look upon, I feel that I must gaze at 
something beautiful for a time or I know that I shall start screaming, 
and never stop.’ 

– Irlianmaris ellarel, asur envoy

Elves,  even  those  resident  within  the  borders  of  Empire,  do 
not consider themselves citizens of the Empire. There are High 
Elves with diplomatic positions in Karl-Franz I’s court, as well 
as traders and merchant princes in many of the great cities of 
the Empire, but the majority of the Asur avoid entanglements 
with  Humans  (not  to  mention  Dwarfs)  and  few  would  call  a 
Reiklander ‘friend’. 

The Wood Elves are even more removed; nearly mythical, rarely 
seen,  and  when  they  do  appear  they  always  have  their  own 
concerns that they rarely share with others.

elF esteem
you will note high-ranking elven characters who do not wish 
to lose career status will only be able to undertake a single 
‘free’ endeavour. this is intentional, designed to offset some 
of the innate advantages elven characters receive, as well as 
reflecting  the  prolonged  time  it  takes  the  long-lived  Elves 
to adapt to change.  of course, if you feel this is unfairly 
penalising  an  elf  character,  or  making  the  game  less  fun, 
ignore one or both restrictions. 

Between  adventures,  all  Elven  characters  must  undertake  one 
Endeavour  maintaining  contact  with  their  own  kind,  seeing  to 
their responsibilities to their people. High Elves commonly give 
reports on interesting things they’ve learned to agents of Ulthuan 
in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with 
the  spies  from  their  arboreal  homes. This  Endeavour  offers  no 
advantage beyond the inherent advantage of being an Elf. Note: 
Elves only lose an Endeavour if the Between Adventures section 
is at least 3 weeks long, thus the Elves have at least 3 Endeavours 
to complete.

geneRal endeavoURs
Below you will find details of the Endeavours any character may 
undertake between adventures.

FlyInG solo
endeavours  are  designed  to  be  undertaken  by  individual 
characters, but if there are reasons for more members of the 
group  to  be  involved,  do  roleplay  these  situations.  equally, 
some of the endeavours may present natural starting points for 
new adventures. For instance, if a player loses all their funds in 
a Banking endeavour, where did the money go? and did the 
thieves leave any clues…?

Banking
This Endeavour allows you to store funds for future use. As noted 
in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between 
Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless 
it  is  saved  with  this  Endeavour.  So,  if  you  have  a  lot  of  money 
spare  it  may  be  worth  a  trip  to  the  bank.  If  you  are  using  a 
Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide 
whether  to  save  your  money  by  investing  it  with  a  reputable 
banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure. 

Investing: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save 
with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it 
should accrue interest. When undertaking a Banking Endeavour 
to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your 
account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively 
you  may  simply  roll  1d10). This  is  the  rate  of  interest  you  will 
accrue,  and  also  how  risky  the  investment  is.  Withdrawing 
funds requires another Banking Endeavour. This may take place 
immediately  after  the  initial  Endeavour,  or  after  subsequent 
adventures have occurred. Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less 
than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you 
have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you 
receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued. 

Stashing:  All  characters  may  choose  to  stash  their  loot.  This 
is  a  risky  strategy,  involving  hiding  it  on  your  person,  in  your 
mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues 
any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the 
start  of  an  adventure,  without  undertaking  an  Endeavour.  Roll 
1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you 
have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds. 

If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for 
you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds 
secured via an Income Endeavour. 

Example: Gerhard and Ulli’s courage in the face of a Greenskin 
horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them 
a haul worth 10 gold crowns each. The ever-prudent Gerhard 
decides to place his money with the esteemed banking house 
Bent, Crooke & Scarper. The GM rolls 1d10 with a result of 6. 
Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings, 
see page 288), and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100 
when he tries to make a withdrawal. 

Ulli — a gambler at heart — buries his money near a mile-marker 
on the road to Ubersreik. He doesn’t need to make an Endeavour 
to get access to his loot, but tragically he rolls 07 when he tries to 
recover it, and finds nothing but freshly disturbed earth, an empty 
chest, and whole heap of regret.

Animal Training
You spend time training one of your animals. Make an Average 
(+20) Animal Training Test. If successful, add one skill to your 
animal from the Trained Creature Trait (see page 342).

Changing Career
In  a  society  as  rigidly  hierarchical  as  the  Empire,  changing 
Careers may require grit and perseverance. Taking time to forge 
the right connections, and learn what is expected of you, can help,  
significantly. Assuming you GM agrees, and you have completed

you current Career, you can move to any Career Level that fits the story of your Character for free. If you have not completed your current Career, the change costs 100 XP. The time spent on this Endeavour represents making the appropriate introductions, doling out bribes, acquiring permits and licences, advertising, and similar activities.CommissionSo, you wish to own one of Von Meinkopt’s legendary repeating pistols? Or a custom helm, with a personalised crest representing your epic victories? The Commission Endeavour allows you to acquire unusual or highly specialized items that are never simply ‘stocked’ in the shops of the Empire. It also allows for you to arrange for the creation of unique items. Such things take time, though…If you are seeking an item with an Exotic rarity and know a source capable of acquiring or manufacturing it, then undertake this Endeavour, spend the necessary funds, and place your order. The item will then be ready for collection after your next adventure.  A character can only commission a single Exotic item per Endeavour; acquiring further items, will require undertaking further Commission Endeavours. If you are unaware of an appropriate source for their item, you will first have to undertake the Consult an Expert Endeavour.Consult an ExpertThe Old World is replete with ancient and arcane knowledge, yet this information is not readily available on some magical box in your pocket. If you want to seek out some piece of obscure arcana, you must first seek out an expert. You may undertake the Consult an Expert Endeavour either to facilitate another Endeavour for example: Commission, Training, or Unusual Learning Endeavours), or to secure a piece of specific knowledge. There are two stages to this Endeavour: locating the expert, then consulting. First, you must locate your expert (this stage may be skipped with the GM’s permission if you have already identified an appropriate expert during your adventures).  Attempt a Challenging (+0) Gossip Test (the Difficulty of this Test will vary according to the size of the settlement where your character is currently living). If you succeed, you have located your expert. If you fail, you have located the loudest self-proclaimed specialist in your location, and the GM is given free rein to vary the quality or accuracy of the advice procured. You can of course refuse to deal with this somewhat suspect source, but you never know if you might have found a diamond in the rough. GMs are contrary like that sometimes.  Once successfully locate an expert, you then need to convince them to talk with you. Depending on what you wish to know, this may require no more than a Simple Charm Test or a modest donation to the local Temple of Verena. In more extreme cases, you may have to commit to performing one or more Favours (see Do Me A Favour!) which may be called in during a future adventure, or ‘bought off’ by spending Endeavours between future adventures. The level of Favour owed depends on the complexity — and danger — of the information you want as determined by the GM. The precise nature of the information gleaned depends on the expert consulted and what you seek to know. Academics will know the origins and full history on a subject with which they are familiar; wizards of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf understand the history of magic and various mystical objects, particularly aspects relevant to their own order; an Apothecary General can identify even the rarest poison; a Verenan scholar may have information relating to any number of historical incidents. In short, the expert’s background will influence how the knowledge is presented, and with which biases.In addition to any specific information the GM imparts to their player, a successful Consult an Expert Endeavour used to seek out knowledge (and not to facilitate another Endeavour) gives you an Expert Reroll (mark this on your character sheet under Notes). This reroll may only be used on a Test specifically relating to the lore revealed and must be used before the end of your next adventure. CraftingRather than browse shops or commissioning someone else to do the hard work, you can fashion your own trappings. Crafting allows you to make any trapping from Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide (or anything else the GM allows) if you have the correct Trade Skills. To do this, you require appropriate Trade Tools, raw materials, and access to an appropriate workshop. In general, the raw materials to create the trapping of your choice will cost a quarter of the trapping’s list price, and must be purchased before Crafting begins (with an Availability as determined by the GM); the GM may rule the raw materials are cheaper or more expensive according to the trapping to be created, and the nature of the raw materials required.Custom GearWith a Gm’s permission, a character may undertake two (or more) consecutive Commission endeavours to acquire even more unusual items: personal commissions from the engineering Guild, a rare and virulent poison, or a magically ensorcelled item. the prices for such things generally range from ‘very high’ to ‘staggering’ and may well involve a Favour or two (see Do me a Favour! ) or even an entire adventure to acquire raw materials. VI

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

DO ME A FAvOUR!
a Favour is a future burden you take on in return for immediate assistance of some sort. In the old World, breaking one’s sworn 
word is considered bad form and carries significant social ramifications. no-one trusts oath breakers, meaning your Status is reduced 
by 1 (see page 49). powerful and dangerous folks tend to take it very, very poorly if someone refuses a Favour owed them, so bloody 
consequences may follow.

The powerful often find it is far more useful to have various individuals owing them Favours than merely soliciting money in return for 
their help. What’s more, it can be an investment: help a student today, call in a favour from a successful lawyer years later. Favours may 
be referred to as ‘boons’, ‘services’, or ‘obligations’ by different folk, but in the end, they all amount to the same.

Favours come in three levels: Minor, Major, and Significant. Regardless of a Favour’s level, in almost all cases, the person owed the 
Favour will take into account the capabilities and sensibilities of the person they’re asking. there’s no point in demanding that a priestess 
of Shallya assassinate a merchant, for example, even if she does owe you a Significant Favour. That being said, Favours are ripe for 
npcs to exploit in order to put pressure on your moral compass. 

•	 A minor Favour represents a simple task that can be completed in no more than a few hours. perhaps you need volunteer at a 
shallyan mercy-house or put in a good word for someone. With the Gm’s permission, you may undertake an endeavour to pay 
off this favour. 

•	 A major Favour is a more time-consuming or risky undertaking. It could take up to several weeks to achieve and may involve travel. 
perhaps you are needed to act as lookout on a string of burglaries, to convince the stevedores’ and teamsters’ Guild to back 
down from a guild war, or to transport a package to a different city. With the Gm’s permission, you may undertake two or more 
consecutive endeavours to pay off this favour. 

•	 A	Significant	Favour is relatively rare and will almost certainly involve risking life and limb. months of travel may be involved, and 
major violence is likely. perhaps you will be asked to eliminate a rival gang boss, wipe out a Goblin encampment, or instigate a 
riot. Significant Favours cannot be paid off via Endeavours; they are roleplayed out as full adventures. 

198

To craft the trapping, attempt an Extended Trade Test, with a Difficulty set by the GM, typically using the Trapping’s Availability as a loose guide.AvailabilityDifficultyCommonAverage (+20)ScarceChallenging (+0)RareDifficult (–10)ExoticVery Hard (–30)The number of SL required to succeed at the Test is also set by the GM, using the listed price for the trapping in the Consumers’ Guide as a reference.The SL required is further modified by the Qualities or Flaws you work into the trapping. Each Flaw halves the SL required, and each Quality adds +5 (worked out after halving for Flaws).Each Endeavour you spend Crafting allows you to make one roll towards your Extended Test. Unfinished work can be kept in whatever you have that amounts to lodgings, or carried around with you as you adventure, should that be possible.List PriceSLBrass5Silver10Gold15+IncomeThis Endeavour covers the many ways you can make money between your bouts of adventuring. The majority will most likely work in a recognized profession — bounty hunters hunt bounties, riverwardens ward rivers, troll slayers slay Trolls — others may rely on a lucrative skill. Wealthier characters, such as Nobles and Merchants, might collect a stipend by (briefly) indulging their B e t W e e n   a dv e n t u r e s

money to the tutor. Training for Basic Skills and all Characteristics 
costs XP+1d10 brass pennies , where XP is the number of XP it 
costs to buy the Advance. Tutoring in all Advanced Skills costs 
double that amount. For more, see Advances, see page 43.

You  should  briefly  narrate  exactly  how  your  character  makes 
money.  This  is  intended  more  for  fun  background  detail  than 
to have any direct consequences, though GMs may well gather 
useful  or  sinister  ideas  for  future  use  depending  on  what  you 
describe.  You  then  acquire  the  income  you’ll  start  your  next 
adventure  with,  which  is  your  standard  income  determined  by 
your  Status  (see  page  51).  Certain  results  on  the Events Table 
on page 193 may directly affect your income. The money you get 
from an Income Endeavour is given to you after your money from 
the last adventure is spent (see Money to Burn).  

In addition to acquiring funds for later use, if you are in the third 
or  fourth  level  of  a  Career  and  undertake  this  Endeavour,  you 
automatically  maintain  your  standing  in  your  career.  See With 
Great Power… on page 195 for details. 

Invent!
Invent allows you to invent new trappings. This is done in two 
stages: Plan and Build. To Plan your new trapping, you first decide 
the trappings you wish to combine to create your invention. As 
examples,  Pistols  have  been  combined  with  other  Pistols  to 
create Repeating Pistols, and Pigeons and been combined with 
Bombs to create Pigeon Bombs. Let your imagination go wild. 
Once you have your plan, it’s time to make the blueprints, which 
costs  1  Endeavour  to  attempt.  Take  a  Trade  (Engineer)  Test, 
with a Difficulty set by how outlandish your proposed trapping 
combination  is  as  determined  by  the  GM.  If  you  succeed,  you 
are  ready  to  start  Building.  Each  SL  scored  adds  +1  SL  to  the 
attempt to build your invention, as the plans are well laid out and 
easy to follow.

To  Build  the  invention,  you  must  either  undertake  a Crafting 
or Commission Endeavour. If it’s Crafting, you are building the 
item  yourself,  and  you  must  have  the  appropriate  Skills  to  do 
so for the trappings being combined; so, if you were combining 
Pigeons  with  Bombs,  you  would  need  Animal  Training  and 
Trade (Explosives). The Difficulty to craft the invention is always 
Very Hard (–30), and the SL is set as normal. The raw materials 
needed to build the invention cost twice the listed price for the 
trappings being combined, and have an Availability rating equal 
to  the  most  scarce  of  the  trappings  used  in  your  invention.  If 
you Commission the invention, you will likely need to undertake 
a Consult an Expert Endeavour first to find someone with the 
required Skills. That done, follow the Commission Endeavour as 
normal; it costs six times the listed price for the trappings to be 
combined to commission the work. The exact rules for your new 
invention are left to your GM to finalise.

Training
The  Training  Endeavour  allows  you  to  train  in  a  Skill  or 
Characteristic outside of your Career, treating it as if it were in-
Career.  In  addition  to  the  normal  XP  cost,  you  must  also  pay 

You should be able to find a tutor for most skills, certainly in a 
city-state like Altdorf, but some particularly unusual skills may 
require  you  seek  out  the  right  instructor,  likely  by  using  the 
Consult an Expert Endeavour — ‘Professionals’ who can teach 
you how to properly pick a lock generally don’t advertise, after all. 
Other skills, especially Lore Skills, often require an institution of 
learning, and some are flat out forbidden in the Empire. Finding 
a tutor capable (and willing) to instruct someone in proscribed 
matters  —  such  as  those  relating  to  the  Ruinous  Powers  or 
Necromancy — may be particularly dangerous, and perhaps an 
adventure to even source such an individual. Such tutors will also 
ask for far more than the ‘going rate’ for tutoring and will likely 
require a Significant Favour (see Do Me A Favour!).

Unusual Learning
It  is  one  thing  to  pick  up  a  Skill  that  can  be  readily  practised, 
quite  another  to  learn  something  for  which  one  may  have  no 
aptitude at all. This Endeavour allows you to attempt to learn a 
Talent outside of your Career. There is no guarantee this attempt 
will be successful, meaning there is a good chance you will fail to 
learn the Talent you hope to acquire, expending XP and money 
to no avail. 

199

VI

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

You can only learn a Talent if you have an appropriate tutor. In 
most  big  cities,  this  will  not  be  a  problem,  but  if  the Talent  is 
particularly obscure, or you are far from a large city, the GM may 
require you complete a Consult an Expert Endeavour first. 

Once you have acquired a tutor, the fee to train the Talent is 2d10 
shillings per 100 XP it costs to purchase the Talent. If you pay 
this  fee,  attempt  a  Hard (-20) Test  using  the  Characteristic  or 
Skill most relevant to the Talent as determined by the GM. If you 
succeed, you have learned the Talent. If not, you have failed this 
time but can try again with a future Endeavour and gain a +10 
modifier for each failed attempt.

adventure. Note this on your character sheet. You can enact this 
Endeavour multiple times if you wish. 

Foment Dissent
Burghers, Peasants
If  you  are  looking  to  sow  civil  unrest,  undertake  the Foment 
Dissent  Endeavour.  By  talking  with  local  citizens,  leading 
meetings, and involving yourself, you can direct conversations to 
slowly feed anger and resentment towards a specific individual, 
group, or institution. But this takes time, so Fomenting Dissent 
takes  two  Endeavours  to  attempt  (and  will  also  count  as  an 
Income Endeavour if you are in the Agitator career).

Class endeavoURs
Class Endeavours tend to be simpler than General Endeavours 
and  often  offer  benefits  more  suited  to  characters  in  specific 
Classes. Any character can undertake any Class Endeavour, but 
if you don’t currently belong to the Classes specified under the 
Endeavour, any Tests you take are one Difficulty Level harder — 
so, Hard (–20) instead of Difficult (–10), for example.

To undertake the Endeavour, you must first attempt an Average 
(+20) Gossip Test  to  understand the local  movers  and shakers. 
If  you  succeed,  attempt  a  Charm  Test  with  the  Difficulty 
determined by how unpopular the target may be. Rousing anger 
against  an  oppressive  noble  may  be  an  Easy  (+40)  test,  while 
raising a mob to protest the good work of a Shallyan hospice may 
be  Hard  (–20).  If  you  fail  either  of  these  tests,  the  Endeavour 
fails. 

Combat Training
Rangers, Warriors
Warriors too long from the field can find their fighting skills lose 
their edge. Hard regular training not only mitigates this, it can 
add an extra advantage when the time comes. If you undertake 
this Endeavour, you spend your days training with the weapons 
you know, honing your skills for the day when it matters most. 

After undertaking this Endeavour, attempt a Challenging (+0) 
Test  using  either  a  Melee  or  Ranged  Skill.  If  you  succeed,  you 
may reverse a Test with the associated Skill once during your next 

If successful, you will find it easier to invoke the wrath of crowds 
upon your chosen target. During your next adventure, you can 
attempt  a  Charm  Test  to  gather  a  rioting  mob  to  accost  the 
target, with the difficulty determined by the GM according to 
how well-planned the mob-to-be is. 

A  single  success  means  you  gather  enough  angered  townsfolk 
to  confront  the  target,  shouting  insults,  demanding  justice, 
throwing rotting vegetables, and generally accosting the focus 
of their ire. An Impressive or Astounding Success may lead to 
uncontrollable lynch mobs, or even attempted burnings! 

B e t W e e n   a dv e n t u r e s

VI

Failure means folk have no stomach for wrath; failing by several 
SL may mean the target, or their sympathisers, become aware 
of your actions…

Once  you  have  the  ear  of  a  mob  (successfully  undertaking  this 
Endeavour), you can attempt to rally the mob against a different 
target  during  an  adventure,  although  this  is  more  difficult,  and 
the Difficulty of the Charm Test is two levels higher. 

The Latest News
Rangers, Riverfolk
This  Endeavour  allows  you  to  learn  the  latest  news  from  afar. 
Attempt a Challenging (+0) Gossip Test. If you succeed, you 
learn an interesting rumour; each SL adds another rumour, and 
they  may  even  be  connected  to  your  upcoming  adventure.  If 
you  fail  particularly  badly  (an  Impressive  Failure)  you  learn 
something false you are convinced is true; to allow this, the GM 
may make this roll in secret on your behalf.

Reputation
Academics, Burghers, Courtiers
Money talks, as they say. If you are looking to exert your influence 
and elevate your Status, you had best be willing to spread your 
wealth around. Any boost to your reputation will fade once the 
coins stop flowing, so you should exploit this advantage while it 
lasts.  

Characters  can  spend  money  to  increase  their  Standing  by  +1 
for  the  next  adventure,  after  which  the  bonus  fades. This  costs 
your  maximum  Earning  income  (see  page  52)  —  so,  if  you 
would normally earn 4d10 pennies, it costs 40d — and requires 
a  Challenging  (+0)  Career  Skill  Test.  If  you  succeed,  your 
Standing  increases  by  +1.  If  you  score  an  Astounding  Success 
(+6),  it  increases  by  +2.  If  you  fail,  you  have  just  wasted  your 
money.  If  you  score  an  Astounding  Failure  (–6),  your  toadying 
has so infuriated your peers, your standing decreases by -1 (to a 
minimum of 0) for the entire duration of your next adventure.

Research Lore
Academics
This  Endeavour  allows  you  to  seek  greater  knowledge 
concerning a specific subject, such as the site of a battle, a famed 
historical event, or an individual. The character must have access 
to an appropriate storehouse of lore, such as a library, the annals 
of a Dwarf Hold, the records of a Guild, or a Temple of Verena.

Attempt  an  Average  (+20)  Lore  Test,  using  the  appropriate 
Lore Specialisation for the knowledge you seek. If you do not 
have  the  correct  Lore  Specialisation  and  are  literate,  you  can 
still  attempt  to  learn  something,  but  it  will  take  a  Difficult 
(–10)  Intelligence  Test.  If  you  succeed,  you  learn  one  piece 

of  interesting,  useful,  or  hidden  knowledge  about  the  subject 
researched; each SL adds another piece of relevant information. 
If  you  fail  particularly  badly  (an  Impressive  or  Astounding 
Failure))  you  learn  something  false  that  you  are  convinced  is 
true; to facilitate this, the GM may want to make this role in 
secret on your behalf. 

Study a Mark
Rogues
You use this Endeavour to observe a potential target and gain 
advantages during future criminal enterprises. A Charlatan may 
study a merchant in order to better impersonate them during a 
future scam, or a Grave Robber may linger about a Temple of 
Morr, watching the coming and going of the priests to get an 
idea of their practices and their Garden of Morr’s layout.

Attempt  a  Challenging  (+0)  Perception  Test,  though  the 
difficulty may be modified for especially easy or difficult marks. If 
you succeed, you may reverse a Test concerning your mark once 
during your next adventure. Note this on your character sheet. You 
can enact this Endeavour multiple times if you wish. Further, the 
GM should provide information (or disinformation!) concerning 
your mark according to the SL you scored.

Signs  of  religion  are  everywhere  in  the  Old  World,  from  the 
magnificent  temples  in  the  great  cities  to  the  humble  wayside 
shrines and household altars. Old Worlders do their best to stay 
on the right side of their gods.

High-ranking clerics are wealthy and powerful, wielding as much 
influence  and  prestige  as  the  greatest  nobles.  At  the  other  end 
of  the  scale,  village  priests  tend  to  the  spiritual  needs  of  rural 
communities, preaching the tenets of their faith and interceding 
with their patron deities on behalf of their flocks. Several faiths 
also  support  templar  orders:  these  private  armies  of  priest-
soldiers answer to the head of their faith rather than to any noble 
or elector count, which can cause significant political friction.

the godS

The  people  of  the  Old  World  recognise  many  deities.  Some 
are  worshipped  across  the  whole  of  the  Old  World;  some  are 
restricted to one nation or region; and some are patrons of just a

In  the  Empire,  the  pantheon  of  gods  is  split  into  three  broad 
categories: the Old Gods, the Classical Gods, and the Provincial 
Gods. Standing apart from these is Sigmar, the first Emperor, and 
patron deity of the Empire as a whole.

The Old Gods
The Old Gods refer to the pantheon of deities worshipped when 
the Empire was unbroken forest populated by wandering tribes of 
barbarians. Many Old Gods stood as patrons to one of the tribes, 
and to this day some are still associated with the old geographical 
hunting grounds of those ancient peoples. Although few say so 
out loud, many citizens of the Empire regard the Old Gods as 
the true deities of the Empire, and the Classical Gods as relative 
newcomers.

The Classical Gods
The  Classical  Gods  spread  from  the  southern  lands  of  Tilea, 
Estalia,  and  the  Border  Princes  through  trade  and  diplomatic 
contact.  Today,  their  worship  is  popular  in  the  cosmopolitan 
towns and cities, and some nobles and townsfolk secretly regard 
them as more sophisticated than the Old Gods — though few 
would risk voicing such opinions aloud!

The most widespread cults of Classical Gods in the Empire are 
dedicated to Verena, Myrmidia, Shallya, and Ranald, patrons of 
wisdom, strategy, mercy, and trickery. Hiding behind these, there 
is also Khaine, the God of Murder, though his cult is outlawed 
in most places.

The Provincial Gods
The  Empire  hosts  a  wide  variety  of  deities  —  patrons  of 
provinces,  towns,  forests,  lakes,  rivers,  crafts,  and  much  more 
besides.  Formed  into  complicated  pantheons  by  local  legends 
and myths, the Provincial Gods often have small cults dedicated 
to  them,  but  few  have  much  influence.  However,  there  are 
exceptions: standing high above other Provincial Gods, worship 
of  Handrich,  the  God  of Trade,  has  spread  significantly  with 
commerce and now boasts a significant cult-presence amongst 
the Empire’s rising merchant class.

Sigmar
Sigmar  founded  the  Empire  over  two-thousand  years  ago,  and 
his  legend  recounts  how  he  conquered  unthinkable  foes  and 
overcame impossible odds. Reigning for fifty years, he eventually 
abdicated  and  turned  east  to  return  his  magical  warhammer, 
Ghal-Maraz,  to  its  forgers:  his  old  allies,  the  Dwarfs.  He  was 
never  seen  again.  Not  long  after,  oracles  and  prophets  claimed 
Sigmar  had  ascended  to  godhood,  invested  by  Ulric  before  the 
entire pantheon of old gods and new.

Today,  many  centuries  later,  the  cult  of  Sigmar,  patron  of  the 
Empire, has spread to such an extent that its leader, the Grand 
Theogonist, is arguably more powerful than the emperor himself.

As time passed, five gods rose to prominence amongst the Old 
Gods,  worshipped  by  dominant  cults  spread  from  one  end  of 
the Empire to the other: Ulric, Taal, Rhya, Manaan, and Morr, 
representing the primal spheres of war, nature, fertility, seas, and 
death.

oTheR panTheons
The  different  countries  and  species  of  the  Old  World  all  have 
deities of their own. Some, according to theologians, are aspects 
of  other  deities  worshipped  under  different  names.  Others  are 

202

r e l I G I o n   a n d   B e l I e F

VII

particularly  revered  by  a  particular  species:  examples  include 
Grungni, the Dwarfen God of Mining and Dwarf Pride; Isha, a 
Goddess of Fertility and Nature who is seen as the mother of all 
Elves; and Esmerelda, the Halfling Goddess of Hearth, Home, 
and Family.

The Chaos gods
The  Daemonic  gods  of  the  Realms  of  Chaos  are  the  greatest 
threat  to  the  Old  World,  each  determined  to  bring  absolute 
ruin  to  the  mortal  realm.  Their  worship  by  lost  and  damned 
souls is pervasive and clandestine, with uncounted dark cultists 
infiltrating  all  levels  of  society.  Khorne,  Nurgle,  Tzeentch,  and 
Slaanesh:  Gods  of  Rage,  Despair,  Ambition,  and  Excess.  Few 
dare whisper their twisting names, for they harbour malevolent 
power, and leave mutation and horror in their wake.

the cultS

The  Old  World  has  many  cults  dedicated  to  appeasing  or 
appealing  to  deities  and  promoting  the  ideals  they  embody. 
Leaders of these cults are frequently influential in local politics. 
They  not  only  stand  as  representatives  of  their  gods,  but  also 
command hundreds or perhaps thousands of clerics and templars: 
temporal power that cannot be ignored.

Orders
Most  Old  World  cults  are  split  into  orders,  with  each  order 
focussing  on  different  aspects  of  their  god’s  concerns.  Orders 
come  in  many  different  forms,  including  monastic  orders  of 
monks  or  nuns,  templar  orders  of  knights,  priestly  orders  that 
attend to holy needs in the community, and mendicant orders of 
friars that wander the Old World, usually subsisting from alms. 
Each  order  is  organised  differently  according  to  individual  cult 
law  and  tradition,  but  in  all  cases  they  swear  allegiance  to  the 
head of their cult, not the local nobility.

Holy Sites
The  cults  maintain  holy  sites  across  the  Old  World,  many  of 
them associated with legendary deeds of the gods from mythical 
times. Most are protected by buildings such as temples, abbeys, 
chapterhouses,  or  monasteries.  Some  older  sites,  or  those  not 
so well known, may only be marked by a shrine or unattended 
chapel.  Cult  buildings  are  usually  decorated  beautifully  inside 
and  out  with  scenes  from  the  religion’s  mythology.  They  vary 
widely  in  size  and  layout  and  often  follow  regional  styles  of 
architecture. Some hold extreme wealth, especially in the towns 
and  cities  where  a  more  affluent  population  provides  greater 
tithes. Larger cult buildings support dozens of people, including 
lay craftspeople, guards, and servants, while smaller sites are run 
by  a  handful  of  staff  aided  by  volunteers  from  the  community. 
In villages, a single priest is the norm, supported by the faithful.

To manage their numerous members, most of the larger cults are 
split  into  orders,  many  of  which  operate  from  significant  holy 
sites or temples.

Shrines and chapels are more modest affairs, the size of a one-
room  house  or  smaller. They  do  not  normally  have  a  full-time 
priest,  although  they  may  come  under  the  charge  of  a  nearby

temple  or  —  especially  in  rural  areas  —  a  wandering  priest 
who travels from one village and shrine to another. In a priest’s 
absence,  local  villagers  pray  unsupervised,  leave  small  offerings, 
and keep the shrine in good repair.

optIons: lIttle prayers
prayers to the gods are rarely answered by those not Blessed 
(see  page  134),  but  the  gods  do  listen  sometimes.  prayers 
offered in holy sites have a chance of receiving divine attention.
If the offering, circumstances, and motivation are appropriate, 
the  Gm  may  secretly  roll  d100  to  see  if  your  prayers  are 
heeded. on a roll of 01, they are. If you have the pray skill, 
the  Gm  may  increase  that  chance.  When  such  prayers  are 
answered, the results may not be exactly what you expect — the 
gods of the old World do not simply grant wishes — but it 
will almost always be something that will help you achieve a 
goal that is important to the deity. this might be a bonus 
to a dice roll, or a one-shot use of a skill or prayer that is 
otherwise unavailable, or some other advantage.

pRimaRy CUlTs of The empiRe
Although  many  hundreds  of  gods  are  worshipped  across  the 
Empire,  ten  are  of  particular  importance,  each  worshipped  by 
cults spanning the grand provinces and granted a special position 
by Magnus the Pious over two-hundred years ago.

The gRand ConClave
When Emperor Magnus the Pious rebuilt the Empire after the 
Great War Against Chaos, he realised previous schisms and civil 
wars besetting his realm were often sourced in religious unrest. 

To  help  prevent  this  happening  again,  Magnus  created  the 
Grand Conclave, a meeting of the primary cults in the Empire 
held  every  five  years  to  air  grievances  and  discuss  resolutions, 
with the emperor sitting as chair.

Though  enormously  controversial  at  the  time,  the  Grand 
Conclave  is  now  fully  accepted,  and  is  held  alongside  great 
celebrations  and  festivities,  with  the  representatives  of  the 
following  gods  required  to  attend:  Manaan,  Morr,  Myrmidia, 
Ranald, Rhya, Shallya, Sigmar, Taal, Ulric, and Verena. Although 
other  influential  cults  exist  —  such  as  the  Cult  of  Handrich, 
which is currently lobbying for a seat on the Conclave — the 
ten currently sitting are widely perceived as the most important 
in the Empire.

the cult oF mAnAnn, god oF the SeA

penanCes
Penances  from  Manann  often  involve  hazardous,  maritime 
pilgrimages,  tests  of  sailing  skills,  or  expeditions  against  the 
sea-god’s  enemies,  especially  followers  of  the  heretical  cult  of 
Stromfels, God of Pirates, Wreckers, and Sharks.

strIctures
•  no whistling or swearing when at sea or on holy ground.
•  never harm an albatross.
•  First catch to manann.
•  A silver and fish to every Manannite temple and shrine 

approached.

•  hunt down the servants of stromfels wherever they may 

hide.

Seat of Power: Marienburg, the Wasteland
Head of the Cult: Matriarch of the Sea
Primary Orders: Order of the Albatross, Order of the Mariner

Common Holy Symbols: Five-tined Crown, Waves, Anchors

Volatile Manann, the son of Taal and Rhya, is the capricious King 
of the Sea, Master of the Maelstroms, and Summoner of Storms. 
Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult 
is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must 
be appeased, it’s Manaan. He’s depicted as an enormous, black-
bearded man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed 
crown of black iron upon his troubled brow. He’s said to dwell 
at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest 
forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep 
gather in his court.

woRshippeRs
Manann is worshipped along coasts throughout the Old World, 
wherever  people  make  their  living  from  the  sea  or  live  close 
enough  for  storms  and  floods  to  threaten  their  homes.  Even 
those who know little of Manann will throw a coin or other small 
treasure into the water before beginning a sea voyage in the hope 
of a smooth crossing.

The  cult  has  a  significant  number  of  orders,  mostly  monastic, 
tasked to guard isolated, sacred islands. The Order of the Albatross 
is  largest,  comprised  of  priests  who  maintain  temples  across 
the  Old  World  and  bless  merchant  or  naval  vessels  with  their 
presence. Often accompanying them, the Order of the Mariner 
is the military arm of Manann, the cult’s templar-marines, sworn 
protectors of Marienburg.

Manann’s  clerics  usually  wear  robes  of  dark  greenish-blue  or 
blue-grey, trimmed with a white wave-pattern.

holy siTes
Manann’s temples are found in all coastal towns and cities, and in 
most river ports where seagoing vessels berth. The high temple is 
in the great port-city of Marienburg: a huge, lavishly decorated 
complex open to the tides. The Matriarch of the Sea, head of the 
Order of the Albatross, is based there, a woman who 
ostensibly leads the entire cult of Manann, although 
in practice the sea-god’s clerics are as mercurial as 
their  god,  and  as  likely  to  be  stubborn  as  to  serve. 
The cult also maintains many monasteries and abbeys 
on  small  isolated  islands,  most  dedicated  to  one  of 
Manann’s many saints.

storage until it is needed for a funeral service. Shrines to Morr also 
take the form of a gateway, usually consisting of two plain pillars 
and a lintel. In some cases, one pillar is white marble and the other 
black basalt.

penanCes
Morr’s  penances  typically  involve  hunting  Necromancers  and 
destroying Undead, or finding and restoring burial places and holy 
sites  fallen  to  disuse  and  disrepair.  He  also  occasionally  requires 
servants of Khaine be stopped from fulfilling their dark deeds.

strIctures

•  respect and protect the dead. 
•  hunt down necromancers and the undead wherever 

they may gather.

•  pay heed to your dreams.
•  never refuse to conduct a funeral service.
•  at no time be a party to raising the dead, unless 

allowed by morr.

Seat of Power: Luccini, Tilea
Head of the Cult: Custode del Portale
Primary Orders: Order of the Shroud, Order of the Black

Thernodies of the Raven
Common Holy Symbols: Portals, Ravens, Black Roses

Urbane  Morr,  God  of  Death  and  King  of  the  Underworld,  is 
husband to Verena, brother to murderous Khaine, and father of 
Myrmidia  and  Shallya.  He  sends  divine  ravens  to  guide  dead 
souls  to  the  Portal,  the  pillared  gateway  between  the  mortal 
realms and the realm of the gods. He then leads each soul from 
there to its final resting place: either Morr’s Underworld, or the 
afterlife of another god. He is commonly portrayed as a tall, dark-
haired man of aristocratic bearing, with a brooding, intense air. 

woRshippeRs
Outside  Ostermark,  where  Morr  has  special  importance,  few 
wish to attract the God of Death’s attention, so normally only the 
bereaved pray to him. However, those desperate or brave enough 
may pray for dreams of what the future may bring, though it is 
said he rarely divulges anything not associated with dying.

The Order of the Shroud dominates the cult, directly controlling 
all  other  orders  and  the  Mourners’  Guild,  those  responsible  for 
overseeing  burials  and  burial  grounds.  Supporting  them,  the 
Black  Guard  are  the  cult’s  largest  templar  order,  tasked  to 
guard  temples  and  hunt  down  the  Undead. The  Order 
of  Augurs  may  be  small,  but  it  guides  the  leadership 
with  its  foretellings,  and  organises  the  Order  of 
Doomsayers: these wandering priests of Morr tour the 
land  performing  Doomings  for  all  Human  children 
on  their  tenth  year.  Bringing  them  all  together,  every 
decade a grand convocation of the priesthood of Morr is 
held at Luccini in Tilea, where the future for the cult is 
discussed around city-wide festivities.

All  Morr’s  clerics  wear  plain,  black,  hooded  robes 
without adornment or trimming.

holy siTes

Temples of Morr are within Gardens of Morr: great graveyards 
wrapped with black roses that bloom all year, and are rarely used 
for anything other than funeral services. Most are plain structures 
of  dark  stone,  distinguished  by  a  broad  doorway  with  a  heavy 
lintel-stone — representing Morr’s Portal. The doors are always 
open, like the doors to the Kingdom of Death.  Inside, the temples 
are bare. Any necessary furniture and other equipment is kept in

rectangular halls. Their exteriors are often carved with low reliefs 
showing battle scenes or tableaux of weapons and shields. Shrines 
may  take  the  form  of  miniature  temples,  statues  of  the  goddess, 
or  free-standing  sculptures  of  stacked  weapons,  shields,  and 
armour. Myrmidia’s holy sites are also known for their scandalous 
depictions of the goddess and her saints, who are often presented 
wearing  little  more  than  scarves  about  their  waists,  which  many 
Sigmarites find completely unacceptable.

penanCes
Penances from Myrmidia are usually military in nature. A cultist 
may be ordered to defeat an enemy champion in single combat, 
or to train a group of peasants and lead them in the defence of 
their village. Protecting pilgrimage routes to sites of importance 
to Myrmidia are also not uncommon.

strIctures

•  act with honour and dignity in all matters.
•  respect prisoners of war, and never kill an enemy who 

surrenders.

•  show no mercy to the unrepentant enemies of humanity.
•  obey all honourable orders.
•  preserve the weak from the horrors of war.

In  the  Empire,  bronzed  Myrmidia,  daughter  of  Verena  and 
Morr, sister of Shallya, is the Goddess of Strategy and Scientific 
Warfare.  However,  in  the  sun-drenched  south,  Myrmidia  is 
much  more  than  this:  she  acts  as  the  patron  deity  of  both  the 
Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically 
worshipped in both realms. Because of this, her cult is the largest 
in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire. 
She  is  commonly  portrayed  as  a  tall,  muscular,  young  woman 
armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings. She is known 
for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics 
do what they can to emulate this.

woRshippeRs
Myrmidia  grants  generals  the  insight  to  win  battles  with 
minimal losses, and soldiers the skill-at-arms to defeat enemies 
quickly  and  without  significant  losses.  Because  of  this,  her 
cult  is  steadily  growing  among  the  armies  and  garrisons  of  the 
Empire,  especially  in  the  Reikland,  Averland,  and Wissenland.
In  the  Empire,  the  cult  has  three  orders  of  significance.  The 
Order of the Eagle tends to the temples and their surrounding 
communities, and is led from Nuln by the ‘Eagle of the North’, 
the most powerful Myrmidian north of the Vaults. The templar 
Order  of  the  Righteous  Spear  has  a  chapterhouse  attached  to 
each of these temples, each commanded by the local high priest. 
A  second  templar  order,  the  Order  of  the  Blazing  Sun,  is  the 
oldest Myrmidian order in the Empire, and works independently 
of the Order of the Eagle.

Myrmidia’s clerics in the Empire normally wear blue cowls over 
white robes with red edging, with her symbol either sewn onto 
the left breast or worn as a cloak-clasp.

holy siTes
Most  of  Myrmidia’s  holy  sites  are  found  in  Estalia  and Tilea, 
and  are  associated  with  the  goddess’s  campaigns  across  those 
realms when she manifested as a mortal over two-thousand years 
ago.  In  the  Empire,  the  goddess  has  much  less  of  a  presence, 
with  temples  only  in  major  towns  and  cities,  and  only  a  single 
monastic order cloistered in the Monastery of the Black Maiden in 
Wissenland. Temples to Myrmidia tend to follow the architectural 
styles of Tilea and Estalia, with domed roofs covering square or

Luck. The latter are often maintained by local ‘shrine clubs’ which 
operate as both social and religious bodies, and are usually led by 
one of the Crooked Fingers. Shrines are almost never elaborate, 
often  just  a  simple,  smiling  statue  with  crossed  fingers  behind 
the back, or a crudely depicted cat or magpie, often fashioned as 
if smiling.

penanCes
Ranald’s  penances  usually  involve  stealing  into  locked  and 
guarded  locations  to  recover  precious  items  or  leave  a  token  of 
their presence. Humiliating oppressors of the poor is also common 
—  perhaps  by  framing  a  brutal  Watch  captain  for  a  ludicrous 
crime, for example, or locking him in his own cells. Ranald often 
sends favoured and disfavoured cultists alike on a ‘Pilgrimage of 
Fingers’, a set of tasks proving capability and loyalty.

strIctures
•  one coin in ten belongs to ranald.
•  never  betray  another  to  the  authorities;  there  is  no 

greater sin than informing.

•  violence is prohibited except in self-defence.
• 
It is better to live free and die than live under oppression.

According  to  myth,  Ranald  was  once  mortal,  a  gentle  bandit 
who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. This so charmed 
Shallya that the goddess fell in love. One fateful day, she found 
Ranald  dying,  fatally  touched  by  the  plagues  of  the  Fly  Lord. 
Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice, 
granting the rogue eternal life. But it was all a trick — Ranald 
had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced 
into the heavens. While generally portrayed as a dapper Human 
wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height, 
weight,  skin  colour,  or  even  gender  of  Ranald,  though  the  god 
is  more  commonly  portrayed  as  male  in  the  Empire.  More  a 
cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a 
love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses.

woRshippeRs
Ranald most commonly stands as a patron to thieves and rogues, 
but the cult also attracts gamblers, liars, merchants, tricksters, and 
the poor and downtrodden.

The cult of Ranald is, by general perception, a disorganised rabble 
of charlatans, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells. However, it is more co-
ordinated than it appears, and split into three primary orders. The 
Crosses  are  the  most  accepted  —  a  priesthood  overseeing  the 
cult’s gambling-dens, typically using the proceeds to administer 
to the poor. The Brotherhood is less open, and is somewhat akin 
to a secret society of merchants — they use business to bring the 
pompous and greedy to their knees. Lastly, and most widespread, 
is  the  publicly  disavowed  Crooked  Fingers,  the  thieves,  rogues, 
and liars of Ranald, a group that is roundly distrusted.

Cultists of Ranald have no conventional garb to identify them, 
but  always  work  cross  symbols  into  their  clothing  somewhere, 
perhaps as a repeating pattern.

holy siTes
Ranald  has  no  formal  temple  organisation,  although  the  cult 
maintains seemingly unconnected gambling dens in most towns 
and cities. Small shrines are found in the headquarters of many 
criminal gangs and merchant houses, and the poorer quarters of 
many cities have street-corner shrines dedicated  to  the  God  of

the cult oF RhyA, goddeSS oF FeRtility 

Shrines to Rhya are usually simple statues of the goddess, often 
piled  high  with  offerings  of  food  and  drink.  Older  shrines  are 
often made of small standing stones marked with worn, spiralled 
patterns.

penanCes
Rhyan penances may involve replanting devastated areas, helping 
broken  households,  and  maintaining  sacred  groves.  It  is  also 
common  to  find  Rhyans  tasked  to  protect  helpless  families, 
which  can  often  put  them  at  odds  with  local  bailiffs  and  law 
enforcement. 

strIctures

•  never feel shame for the flesh Rhya gave you.
•  life is sacred, do no harm lest another life is in danger.
•  never judge whom another loves.

Bountiful Rhya is the Goddess of Fertility and Summer, widely 
known  as  the  Earth  Mother  and  She  Who  Sustains  Life. 
Though  typically  depicted  as  the  wife  of Taal,  myths  connect 
her  to  many  gods,  and  she  has  children  from  many  of  those 
relationships.  Most  commonly  portrayed  as  a  tall,  beautiful 
women wreathed in leaves and bedecked in fruit, Rhya’s statues 
are  normally  nude,  pregnant,  and  surrounded  by  her  children. 
Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult 
comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living 
from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found 
in secluded communities to this day.

woRshippeRs
Rural folk across the Old World venerate Rhya, relying on her 
to provide the crops upon which their lives depends. Womanfolk 
comprise  the  main  body  of  the  cult,  and  most  midwives  pay 
at  least  lip-service  to  Rhya’s  Wisdom,  a  set  of  oral  traditions 
surrounding childbirth. Although she is not openly worshipped 
in the towns and cities — townsfolk often turning to Shallya in 
her stead — her name is frequently tied with Taal’s, so she is still 
well known amongst such people. 

Because the cult has no great temples and protects no holy books 
or  relics  of  significance,  many  scholars  believe  her  worship  to 
be  declining,  and  possibly  already  dead.  Her  many  cultists  do 
nothing to contradict such talk.

Rhya’s cultists have no fixed vestment or preferred garb, though 
greens are very common, as is using plants, flowers, or herbs to 
accessorise any clothing. They often dress in a fashion considered 
far too revealing by Sigmarite doctrine, which can cause friction 
as the Rhyans believe giving in to such prudishness is tantamount 
to encouraging the Prince of Excess into your lives, as it builds 
forbidden  desires.  Devotees  of  Sigmar  invariably  disagree, 
believing  abstinence  and  restricting  temptation  is  a  better 
response to such dangers than indulgence.

holy siTes
Rhya has no large temples, though many ancient sites constructed 
from  oghams  (standing  stones)  are  centres  of  worship  for  her 
cult, and some still echo each equinox with the cries of fevered 
celebrants.

smaller subsidiary chapels, commonly endowed by local families, 
and  are  often  connected  to  hospitals.  Shrines  are  usually  simple, 
often with the dove or heart of Shallya carved into stone, or with 
small fountains gushing eternal tears from simple statues.

penanCes
Penances  set  by  Shallya  always  involve  helping  the  sick,  poor, 
or downtrodden. A cultist might be sent to a village struck by a 
plague to tend the sick until the disease has passed. Shallya often 
tasks her servants to help the wounded at war, or patrol popular 
pilgrimage routes for those unable to complete their journeys due 
to ill health.

strIctures
•  always render assistance without judgement, based only 

on a person’s need. 

•  never kill except in self-defence or when facing 

followers of the Fly lord.

•  hunt down servants of the Fly lord wherever they may 

fester.

•  shallya’s work is never done, so turn not to self-

indulgence.

•  never take up arms; a walking stick and courage will 

suffice.

Shallya is the Goddess of Healing, Mercy, and Compassion. She 
is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia. 
Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose 
eyes  are  perpetually  welling  with  tears  as  she  weeps  for  the 
world’s  pain.  It  is  said  Shallya’s  compassion  knows  no  bounds, 
and  in  some  myths  —  such  as  the  stories  of  Ranald  tricking 
her  into  granting  him  immortality,  or  Manaan  trapping  her 
at  the  bottom  of  the  sea  —  she  seems  trusting  to  the  point  of 
foolishness. However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available 
to all, without judgment. True foolishness consists of presuming 
to judge who is worthy of Shallya’s grace and who is not.

woRshippeRs
Most Old Worlders think of Shallya’s cult as composed of healers 
and physicians, but her worshippers also include many who work 
to  help  alleviate  suffering  of  other  kinds:  charitable  souls  who 
help the poor; workers in orphanages, asylums, and refuges; and 
even brave folk who go in search of lost and missing people on 
behalf of their loved ones.  The cult is ruled by the far-reaching 
Order  of  the  Bleeding  Heart,  which  maintains  all  the  temples, 
hospices,  mercyhouses,  and  other  holy  sites.  The  significantly 
smaller  Order  of  the  Chalice  tasks  its  mendicants  to  cleanse 
the Fly Lord’s influence, tackling the worst diseases and plagues 
wherever they may fester.

Shallya’s  cultists  all  wear  white  robes,  often  hooded,  with  a 
bleeding heart symbol embroidered on the left breast.

holy siTes
The high temple of all Shallya’s cult is in Couronne, Bretonnia, 
built  over  a  famous  healing  spring.  Locals  claim  the  magical 
waters were once poured there from the same chalice Shallya used 
to grant Ranald immortality, which they claim is the holy grail of 
the Lady, the patron Goddess of Bretonnia. Whatever the truth, it 
is a popular destination for pilgrims, many of whom travel there to 
be healed from intractable disease. Elsewhere, every town or city 
of any size has a temple to Shallya, and most smaller settlements 
have at least a shrine dedicated to her. Temples of Shallya normally 
consist of a courtyard with a temple on one side and an infirmary 
on the other, all constructed in southern styles. Larger temples have

of priests and lay workers, and guarded by at least two orders of 
templars; at the other end of the scale, a village chapel may be 
visited just once every week by a travelling priest, who serves the 
needs of several small settlements.  Shrines can be found in most 
homes, and wayshrines dot every major highway, mostly marked 
with hammers or comets.

penanCes
Sigmarite  cultists  may  be  ordered  to  destroy  a  cell  of  Chaos-
worshippers, or expose a corrupt official who is secretly in league 
with the Ruinous Powers or a foreign power. It is also common 
to  be  tasked  with  building,  or  rebuilding,  local  communities  to 
better promote unity and strength in the Empire.

strIctures

•  obey your orders.
•  aid dwarf-folk, never do them harm.
•  promote the unity of the empire.
•  Bear true allegiance to the imperial throne.
•  root  out  Greenskins,  chaos  worshippers,  and  foul 

witches without mercy.

Seat of Power: Altdorf, Reikland

Primary Orders: Order of the Anvil, Order of the Cleansing 
Flame, Order of the Silver Hammer, Order of the Torch
Major Festivals: Sigmarday (28th Sigmarzeit)

Common Holy Symbols: Ghal-maraz (Sigmar’s Warhammer), 
twin-tailed comets, griffons

Sigmar is the Empire’s patron, and his cult dominates the realm. 
Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably 
interwoven  with  politics,  and  three  of  the  cult’s  highest-ranking 
members  are  directly  involved  with  electing  new  emperors.
According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar’s birth was heralded 
by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief 
of  the  Unberogen  tribe.  When  older,  he  received  the  magical 
warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter’) as a gift from the Dwarf 
king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins. Sigmar 
later  allied  with  the  Dwarfs  and  their  combined  forces  defeated 
the Greenskins. He was then crowned as the first emperor of the 
Human tribes he’d united. After fifty years of extraordinary rule, 
Sigmar  mysteriously  vanished,  only  to  later  ascend  to  divinity, 
crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar’s patron in life.

woRshippeRs
Most folk of the Empire pay at least lip-service to their patron 
deity.  In  the  most  devout  provinces,  like  Reikland,  Sigmar 
worship is an unquestioned part of daily life. Folk attend weekly 
‘throngs’ where the lessons of Sigmar are preached. Many also 
attend  temple  to  train  as  local  militia,  confess  sins  and  purify 
the soul, or receive advice on how to be more like the God-King 
of old.  Sigmar’s cult is comprised of an uncounted number of 
different orders. The largest is the Order of the Torch: Sigmar’s 
priests  who  lead  their  local  communities.  Other  orders  of 
importance  include:  the  Order  of  the  Cleansing  Flame, 
comprised  of  inquisitors  and  witch  hunters;  the  Order  of  the 
Silver  Hammer,  which  includes  warrior  priests  and  yet  more 
witch  hunters;  and  the  Order  of  the  Anvil,  a  monastic  order 
concerned  with  preserving  Sigmar’s  deeds  and  laws.  The  cult 
also has many templar orders. The most famous are the proud 
Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, the fanatical Knights of the Fiery 
Heart, and the militaristic Knights Griffon. Given the cult is so 
large, there are many different uniforms, vestments, and robes 
worn, all of which have different colours, cuts, and accessories 
according to local tradition and requirement.

holy siTes
Every city, town, and village in the Empire has at least one temple 
to Sigmar. The Grand Cathedral in Altdorf is staffed by hundreds

the cult oF tAAl, god oF the Wild 

forest groves, and other natural places are also used as shrines, and 
usually only a local or a devout follower of Taal can find them.

penanCes
Taal’s  penances  usually  involve  clearing  diseased  or  mutated 
monsters from wild areas, replanting sacred trees, and maintaining 
groves important to the cult. A cultist might also be ordered to 
climb a high mountain and leave a stone on a cairn at the top, 
or  clear  an  obstruction  at  the  top  of  a  waterfall. Whatever  the 
specific  task  that  must  be  undertaken,  Taal’s  penances  almost 
always challenge the cultist to survive in the wild.

strIctures

•  offer a prayer of thanks for every animal taken.
•  spend  a  week  alone  communing  with  the  wilderness 

every year.

•  eschew metal armour; clad yourself in the hides of taal.
•  rely on your own skill, not the advances of gunpowder 

or cold technology.

•  never harm an animal except in self-defence or for food 

or sacrifice.

Seat of Power: Talabheim, Talabecland
Head of the Cult: The Hierarch
Primary Orders: Order of the Antler, The Longshanks
Major  Festivals:  Spring  Equinox,  with  other  equinoxes  also 
celebrated
Popular Holy Books: The Book of Green, Rites of the Ancient 
Grove, Tome of Summer’s Path
Common Holy Symbols: Antlers, oaks, stone axes

Taal  is  the  God  of  Wild  Places  and  Animals,  and  the  King 
of  Nature.  He  is  the  husband  to  Rhya,  and  father  to  Manaan, 
and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though 
other cults dispute this. All nature is under his purview, from the 
snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to 
the greatest beast. He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built, 
virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is 
known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt.

woRshippeRs
Rural  folk  across  the  Old  World  venerate  Taal,  and  any  who 
make their living in wild places take care not to offend him. Taal 
is the patron deity of Talabecland in the Empire, where his cult 
holds significant sway, influencing all levels of society.

Taal’s cult has a variety of smaller orders dedicated to holy sites 
and groves throughout the Old World, but two orders drive the 
cult forwards. The Order of the Antler are the priests of the cult, 
who are tasked to teach Taal’s ways and protect the wild places 
from intrusion. 

These  Taalites  are  particularly  widespread  in  Talabecland, 
and  their  forest  temples  are  hubs  of  activity  for  rural  folk. The 
Longshanks are a mix of warrior-priest and templar who typically 
wander as individuals, cleansing Taal’s wild places of corruption 
and ensuring rural communities do nothing to upset Father Taal.

holy siTes
Normally, temples to Taal are small, rustic affairs, built of wood 
and rough stone in a manner unchanged for countless centuries. 
They are usually sited close to natural features of wonder such as 
waterfalls,  swirling  pools,  and  mountains,  and  often  have  small 
sweat  lodges  attached. The  high  temple  of Taal  in Talabheim  is 
something of an anomaly when compared to this. It appears more a 
well-maintained, albeit wild, noble garden than a temple, and huge 
services are held there under the spreading rowan trees weekly. 

Officially, the Hierarch leads the cult from there, though he spends 
most  of  his  time  in  the  wild  groves  of  the  nearby Taalgrunhaar 
Forest. Shrines to Taal are barely structures at all. Some old trees 
are regarded as sacred, and offerings pile up at their bases. Caves,

and  by  an  ever-stocked  fire  in  a  circular  hearth  tended  by  the 
priesthood. Behind the fire, usually against a rear wall, stands a 
statue  of  Ulric  enthroned,  often  flanked  by  a  pair  of  enormous 
wolves. Shrines are similar but smaller, with a lamp in place of a 
fire and small statues just a foot or two tall.

penanCes
Penances set by Ulric are almost always tests of strength, courage, 
and  martial  skill.  Slaying  a  powerful  monster,  or  clearing  out  a 
nest of Beastmen or outlaws, are typical tasks.

strIctures

•  obey your betters.
•  defend your honour in all matters, and never refuse a 

challenge.

•  stand honest and true; outside an ambush, trickery and 

deception are forbidden.

•  only wear pelts from wolves killed by weapons crafted 

of your own hands.

•  Blackpowder, helmets, crossbows, and technology are 

not ulric’s way.

Seat of Power: Middenheim, Middenland

Primary Orders: Order of the Howling Wolf, Order of the

Common Holy Symbols: White Wolves, stylised ‘U’s, claws

Ulric is the ferocious God of Wolves, Winter, and Warfare. He is 
the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the 
gods, although other cults dispute this. He is normally portrayed 
as  a  massive,  heavily  bearded  barbarian  wearing  a  white  wolf-
pelt cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil. He’s 
a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to 
rely on individual strength and prowess. He despises weakness, 
cowardice,  and  trickery,  and  favours  the  direct  approach  in  all 
matters.

woRshippeRs
Ulric’s cult is strongest in the north of the Empire. The city-state 
of Middenheim, with its enormous high temple to Ulric, is the 
heart  of  his  cult,  and  the  god  is  regarded  as  the  city’s  patron. 
Elsewhere,  he  is  worshipped  mainly  by  warriors  and  soldiers. 
Devout  Ulricans  can  usually  be  spotted  by  their  long  hair  and 
beards, for most choose not to cut it, imitating their wild deity.
Ulric’s  cult  is  split  into  just  two  orders:  the  priestly  Howling 
Wolves, and the templar White Wolves. The Howling Wolves are 
not very popular outside Middenland and Nordland, viewed by 
most folk to be too coarse for this enlightened era. By comparison, 
the Knights of the White Wolf are enormously popular, easily the 
largest knightly order in the Empire, and the oldest templar order 
in the Old World. Ulric’s priests wear black robes with a howling 
white wolf emblem on the chest. A wolf pelt across the shoulders 
is also common, as is fur trimmings.

holy siTes
Ulric’s high temple is in Middenheim, and the cult’s leader, Ar-
Ulric (which means the son of Ulric), has enormous temporal and 
spiritual sway. At the back of the high temple lies the Flame of 
Ulric, a huge, ever-burning, argent fire granted by the winter god 
to guide his people. This miracle is the focus of several pilgrimage 
routes, and all Ulricans of Middenland are expected to bathe in 
its cold light at least once in their lives. Smaller temples are found 
in  every  city  and  town  of  any  size,  but  are  grander  and  more 
numerous  in  the  north  than  in  the  south.  Chapels  and  shrines 
can be found in barracks and forts throughout the Old World.

Temples  resemble  fortified  keeps  and  are  normally  square. The 
interior of the main hall is lit by small windows high in the walls,

seated with a book in her lap, a pair of scales in her left hand, and 
her right hand resting on the hilt of a sword. Smaller rooms lead 
off from the main temple, including a library and chambers for 
the attendant priests. Each temple has at least one meeting room 
where negotiations can take place under the eyes of the goddess.

penanCes
Penances  set  by  Verena  normally  involve  the  recovery  or 
preservation  of  knowledge,  the  righting  of  an  injustice,  or  the 
resolution of a dispute. Cultists may also be sent to recover a long-
forgotten book of lore, or to mediate in a difficult quarrel. This 
could be anything from a farmers’ boundary dispute to unpicking 
the complicated politics of two realms on the brink of war.

strIctures

•  never refuse to arbitrate a dispute when asked.
•  always tell the truth without fear or favour.
•  protect knowledge at all costs.
•  combat must be a last resort when all alternative routes 

are fruitless.

•  never become a tool of injustice or heresy.

Wise Verena,  the  Goddess  of  Learning  and  Justice,  is  the  wife 
of  dark  Morr  and  the  mother  of  Myrmidia  and  Shallya.  She 
is  generally  depicted  as  a  tall,  classically  beautiful  woman,  and 
usually carries a sword and a set of scales. As the patron of justice 
she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law: 
she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime.

woRshippeRs
Verena  is  worshipped  throughout  the  Old World,  especially  in 
the  south.  Her  devout  followers  include  scholars,  lawyers,  and 
magistrates,  as  well  as  some  wizards  of  the  Colleges  of  Magic, 
particularly of the Grey and Light orders.

The cult of Verena has no rigid hierarchy: it is said that Verena 
alone  heads  the  cult,  and  no  mortal  intermediary  is  needed 
because  truth  is  self-evident  and  requires  no  interpretation. 
Temple  priests  from  the  Order  of  Lorekeepers  are  tasked  to 
preserve  knowledge  and  communicate  it  to  the  community. 
They  keep  up  a  voluminous  correspondence  with  each  other, 
exchanging information and news. 

Priests  from  the  equally  influential  Order  of  Scalebearers  are 
much sought after to act as judges, arbitrators, and go-betweens, 
because  of  their  famed  impartiality  and  mastery  of  the  law. 
The  Order  of  Mysteries  is  much  smaller  and  less  well-known, 
and  contains  warrior-priests  who  seek  lost  and  forgotten  lore, 
wherever  it  may  lie. The  last  major  order  is  the  Knights  of  the 
Everlasting  Light,  templars  famed  for  their  sword  skills,  sense 
of fairness, and legendary bad luck. Verena’s cultists usually wear 
plain white robes, symbolic of pure truth and impartiality.

holy siTes

Temples  to  Verena  can  be  found  in  most  cities  and  larger 
towns,  generally  situated  in  the  administrative  or  university 
quarters. Most libraries and court-houses include a shrine to the 
goddess, and smaller shrines can be found in the homes of many 
scholars and lawyers. Temples usually have colonnaded facades, 
with  symbols  of  the  goddess  and  allegorical  figures  of  learning 
presented in low relief. Inside is a large statue of Verena, normally

dWARven AnceStoR godS

The  Dwarfs  venerate  their  ancient  ancestors,  valuing  tradition 
above all else. Though the Time of the Ancestor Gods was many 
thousands of years ago, the Dwarfs still hold records of that time 
in their oldest Holds. Many names echo from that era, creating 
a  broad,  inter-related  pantheon,  but  three  Ancestor  Gods  are 
of  especial  importance  and  are  known  by  all  Dwarfs:  Grimnir, 
Grungni, and Valaya, each a progenitor of the species as a whole.
In addition to the oldest Ancestor Gods, Dwarfs also revere the 
founders of local clans as guardian deities.

dwaRf pRiesTs
Those dedicating themselves to the cults of the Ancestor Gods do 
not use the Priest, Nun, or Warrior Priest Careers, as Dwarfs have 
a very different relationship with their gods, seeking to emulate 
them rather than worship or appease them. 

Because of this, if you wish to play a Dwarf dedicated to one of 
the Ancestor Gods, simply choose an appropriate career to best 
act like that god. So, if you wanted to emulate Grimnir, effectively 
becoming a priest of Grimnir, perhaps play a Slayer and join the 
Cult of the Slayer, or maybe become a Soldier.

elven godS

The Elves worshipped their own gods long before Humans and 
most other species existed in their current forms. Their pantheon 
is  extensive,  with  different  groups  of  deities  being  held  as 
important by Wood Elves and High Elves. 

Loosely, there are two groups of gods, the Cadai and the Cytharai. 
The  Cadai  rule  the  heavens,  and  have  strong  connections  to 
their  Elven  worshippers,  directly  helping  where  they  can.  The 
selfish  Cytharai  rule  the  underworld,  and  care  little  for  the 
Elves. Standing apart from both these courts are a loose group 
of  unaligned  gods,  the  most  prominent  being  Morai-Heg  the 
Crone, Goddess of Fate and Death.

The High Elves especially revere the Cadai, and have sophisticated 
priesthoods  dedicated  to  their  teachings.  They  appease  the 
Cytharai when necessary, but it is unlawful to worship any but 
Mathlann, whose aid is sought by mariners. According to their 
myths, Asuryan, the God of Creation, is king of all the gods, able 
to pronounce judgement upon them all.

The Wood Elves take a much more balanced approach and have 
temples and shrines to all the gods impacting their lives, be they 
Cadai  or  Cytharai.  Because  of  their  close  association  with  the 
woods and forests, they revere Isha the Mother and Kurnous the 
Hunter above all others, and rumours persist that both gods take 
a direct hand in Wood Elf affairs.

According to some theologians — mostly Elven — the deities of 
this pantheon are the true gods, and those worshipped by other 
species are simply different aspects of the Elven originals.

elven pRiesTs
Both High Elves and Wood Elves have priesthoods for the gods, 
but  they  do  not  have  blessings  and  miracles.  The  Elves  don’t 
believe the gods manifest in this fashion, and instead see magic 
as a gift from the gods. Because of this, if you wish to be an Elven 
priest, use the Wizard career, and chose from an appropriate Lore 
to represent the magic your god has gifted. So, a ‘priest’ of Kurnous 
would use the Lore of Beasts, a worshipper of Isha, the Lore of 
Life, and devotees of Asuryan use the Lores of Light or Fire.

hAlFling godS

Some  say  that  Halflings  are  superstitious  rather  than  religious, 
and  the  bulk  of  their  deities  support  this  impression.  Most 
Halfling gods and goddesses have to do with hearth and home, 
cooking,  herb  lore,  earthy  matters,  and  general  day-to-day 
concerns.  Halfling  gods  are  practical  rather  than  philosophical: 
as the saying goes: ‘Deep thoughts butter no parsnips’. Halflings 
also show respect to certain Human deities — Sigmar, Taal, and 
Rhya  in  particular  —  but  this  is  more  from  a  desire  to  avoid 
conflict than from any sincere devotion.

halfling pRiesTs
Halflings don’t really have priests, and they certainly don’t build 
temples (though Humans seem happy to do it for them, especially 
Sigmarites). There are better things to do than warble on about 
someone  else’s  business.  Of  course,  they  respect  the  gods,  and 
have  shrines  on-hand  should  they  need  to  have  a  quick  natter, 
but none make a career exclusively talking to just one god — why 
make yourself so exclusive? Should a particular god need to be 
appeased, it is usually left up to a local elder to do what’s required 
on  behalf  of  the  community,  often  after  a  great  deal  of  talking 
with relevant experts and peers.

chAoS godS

The  Ruinous  Powers  of  Chaos  are  the  foremost  existential 
threat  to  the  Old  World,  but  much  about  them  remains  a 
mystery. Merely seeking such knowledge is punishable by death 
without permission from the Cult of Sigmar. And seeking such 
permission attracts intense scrutiny of your person and motives, 
and is seldom granted.

The Ruinous Powers are seen by the common folk as the punishing 
manifestation of sin, and the reason that all must behave within 
socially acceptable boundaries as espoused by the cults. Indulging 
in  violence,  lust,  slovenliness  or  unseemly  curiosity  has  direct 
repercussions for the individual (as they are corrupted and come to 
a sticky end) and for their community, as their deviant behaviour 
attracts the destructive attention of these evil forces. 

The  average  person  will  know  of  the  most  powerful  of  these 
forces through euphemistic names, such as the Blood God, the 
Plague Lord, the Lord of Change, and the Prince of Pain. Even 
the most learned scholars of this forbidden lore can only guess 
at what motivates these obscene powers, or if they even have an 
agenda beyond their primal impulses. 

It  seems  there  are  competing  factions  dedicated  to  different 
aspects of ruin, and they are as much enemies to each other as 
to the rest of the Old World. On the rare occasions when they 
co-operate, much like they did during the Great War Against 
Chaos over two-hundred years ago, the world trembles. Some 
claim  cults  dedicated  to  the  Chaos  Gods  have  infiltrated  the 
Empire.  Most  dismiss  this  as  nonsense,  for  no  right-thinking 
individual would be so foolish as to worship one of the Ruinous 
Powers.

Blessings and miRaCles
Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed, 
and then empowered by a god. To enact a Blessing or Miracle, 
make a Challenging (+0) Pray Test. If you score a Success, your 
Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high 
SL will give you bonus effects. If you score a Failure, your words 
are spoken, but your god, for whatever reason, refuses to listen. If 
you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must 
roll on the Wrath of the Gods table.

Limitations
You  must  be  able  to  speak  to  intone  the  required  prayer,  rite, 
chant,  or  song  to  enact  a  Blessing  or  Miracle.  Each  of  your 
Blessings  or  Miracles  can  only  be  in  effect  once,  meaning  you 
have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using 
the same prayer again. 

Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals 
do not offer cumulative bonuses. Thus, intoning two Blessings of 
Finesse will only provide a bonus of +10 to Dexterity.

sin poinTs
The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the 
disfavour of their deities if they should act contrary to their gods’ 
will. In game, this is represented with Sin points.

If  you  violate  any  of  the  Cult  Strictures  listed  under  your  god, 
the  GM  will  award  one  or  more  Sin  Points.  Every  time  you 
receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total. There is 
no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn. The more 
points you have, the more upset your god is likely to be should 
you call upon divine aid.

PRAyeRS

A  small  number  of  the  faithful  stand  apart  from  their  peers, 
seemingly  able  to  appeal  for  their  deity’s  direct  intervention  in 
the form of miracles. Those who perform such feats are known 
by many names in different parts of the Old World — including: 
Living  Saints,  Gods’  Servants,  The  Hallowed,  Divine  Wills, 
Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most commonly 
referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title. So, if Sister 
Anna  where  to  be  Blessed  by  Sigmar  —  i.e.  granted  Sigmar’s 
grace,  able  to  have  her  prayers  answered  —  she  would  become 
‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’.

The Blessed
There  are  two Talents  that  specifically  mark  out  those  Blessed 
by the gods: Bless and Invoke. Characters with the Bless Talent 
may  enact  Blessings,  which  are  minor  manifestations  of  divine 
will, while the Invoke Talent allows the Blessed to call on their 
gods for more powerful Miracles. For more on these Talents, see 
Chapter 4: Skills and Talents.

217

IT’S A SIn!
there are many different ways Blessed priests can break their 
strictures;  Gms  should  consider  the  scale  of  the  infraction 
when awarding sin points, and allocate them proportionately, 
normally scoring 1 to 3. For instance, one of the strictures 
of the cult of myrmidia is to respect prisoners of war. If a 
myrmidian  priest  were  to  deny  a  thirsty  prisoner  of  war  a 
drink of water, this may earn a single sin point. Beating a 
prisoner would be a great infraction, securing maybe 2 sin 
points. torturing or killing a helpless prisoner is unacceptable 
to myrmidia, easily earning 3 or maybe more sin points. 

Kind  Gms  may  wish  to  warn  players  before  they  commit 
infractions, especially if they are new to WFrp.

VII

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Sin and Wrath
Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to 
the god’s wishes is risky. Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the 
units  die  of  the  result  is  equal  to  or  less  than  your  current  Sin 
point total, then you will suffer the Wrath of the Gods, even if 
the Pray Test is successful.

wRaTh of The gods
The Wrath of Gods table is referenced whenever you Fumble a 
Pray Test, or when the units die of a Pray Test is equal or lower 
than your current Sin points. The GM may also use it, or pluck 
results  from  it,  whenever  you  foolishly  insult  any  of  the  gods.
When rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table, add +10 to the roll 
for each Sin Point you have accrued. After rolling and applying 
the result, reduce your Sin points by 1, to a minimum of 0.

OPTIOnS: PREACH IT, SISTER!
each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to 
be intoned in different ways. Whether these are the warcries 
of ulric, the shanties of manaan, or the threnodies of morr, 
each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with 
conviction. 

to represent this, the Gm may require that any pray tests 
that are intoned quietly or without confidence have a higher 
Difficulty.

yOU’vE GOT TO PRAy!
If a character behaves in a particularly pious manner, such as 
completing  an  arduous  pilgrimage,  or  making  a  significant 
donation to their cult, the Gm may wish to remove one or 
more sin points with a successful pray test, used to show you 
are begging for absolution. this, of course, also risks the chance 
of Wrath of the Gods. otherwise, the only way to remove sin 
points is by rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

dIvIne servants
divine servants are supernatural minions of the gods in the 
material realm, in the same way that daemons serve the dark 
Gods. they tend to take the form either of a favoured animal — 
such as a white wolf for ulric or a golden eagle for myrmidia 
— or a departed devotee of the god, such as a legendary priest or 
templar. to construct divine servants appropriate to the god at 
hand, use the rules in chapter 12: bestiary, modifying an animal, 
Human, or Daemon as you see fit.

Penance
Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance. The GM can 
decide upon a suitable penance depending on your misdeed, or 
they  may  prefer  you  to  choose  your  own  penance,  with  further 
punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent. Examples 
of typical penances are listed in each cult description. Penances 
may come in the form of a vision, divine inspiration or, very rarely, 
by direct communication from your deity. If you are not worthy 
of  such  contact,  a  penance  may  be  conveyed  through  another 
member of your cult. Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult 
could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a figure of legend, 
or  an  appropriate  animal  —  and  inform  you  what  is  required. 
The GM should consider the sins involved, and how the god in 
question would likely react to these.

BlessInG and mIracle Format
•  the name of the Blessing or miracle
•	 Range: a range in yards, or marked as ‘touch’, showing 

you need touch your target.

•	 target: the number of targets affected; it may just be 

you.

•	 duration: the duration of the Blessing, usually 

expressed as ‘Instant’ or as a number of rounds. 

•  the description of what the Blessing does.

optIons: petty concerns
the gods grow irritated when the Blessed abuse their privileges. 
If the Gm wishes, multiple uses of Blessings and miracles 
in the same scene, on the same injury, on the same target, or 
similar can anger the gods, and result in sin points, typically 
ranging from 1 to 3.

sUCCess levels
For  every  +2  SL  you  score  in  a  Pray  Test  when  attempting  a 
Blessing, you may choose one of the following benefits:

•	 Range: +6 yards
•	 Targets: +1
•	 Duration: +6 Rounds

bleSSingS

Blessings  are  minor  manifestations  of  divine  will;  a  character 
with  the Bless Talent  receives  all  six  Blessings  for  their  cult  as 
listed in Blessings by Cult.

If the Blessing in question has a Duration of ‘Instant’, you may 
not extend the Duration. You may choose the same option more 
than  once.  For  instance,  if  you  rolled  +4  SL  on  a  Blessing  of 
Healing,  you  could  heal  three  targets  you  were  touching,  two 
targets up to 6 yards away, or one target up to 12 yards away.

dIvIne manIFestatIons
Blessings are subtle, completely imperceptible to those without the holy visions talent, their manifestation usually indistinguishable 
to good fortune. In this way, clerics of the old World without the Blessing talent often appear to be as effective as those with it. 

By comparison, Miracles are overtly manifest, always accompanied by holy signs and portents, which should reflect the circumstances 
and relevant deity. For instance, an ulrican miracle may be accompanied by a chill wind and the spectral howl of wolves, while those 
receiving a Miracle of Manann may find themselves drenched in saltwater.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

names
each cult has unique names for every Blessing and miracle 
— sometimes more than one name. For instance, the cult of 
sigmar may refer to the Blessing of Battle as ‘the litany of 
sigmar’s  Wrath’,  while  the  cult  of  ulric  may  call  it  ‘the 
sharp Bite of Winter’. the words spoken will be different, but 
the end effect will be the same. 

miRAcleS

Miracles are major manifestations of a god’s will, awe-inspiring 
events everyone will notice; a character with the Invoke Talent 
can empower one of the Miracles for their cult from the following 
lists. 

sUCCess levels
For every 2 Success Levels you achieve in a Miracle Pray test, you 
may add additional range, duration or targets equal to the initial 
value listed in the Miracle. So, a Miracle with a range of 50 yards 
could be increased by an extra +50 yards for every +2 SL scored. 

Miracles  with  a  Range  and Target  of  ‘You’  may  only  target  the 
Blessed Priest making the Pray Test, and can never have the range 
or targets increased. Similarly, if the Miracle has no duration, there 
is no benefit in choosing to extend its duration.

Certain  Miracles  may  have  additional,  optional,  benefits  for 
additional SL written into their descriptions.

miRaCles of manann 

Becalm
Range: Initiative Bonus Miles 
Target: 1 sailing vessel within Line of Sight
Duration: 1 Hour
You steal the wind from the sails of a ship or boat. It is completely 
becalmed.  Even  in  stormy  weather  an  area  of  eerie  calm  and 
smooth  waters  surrounds  the  vessel  while  gales,  lashing  rains 
and towering crests surge and crash around it. This area of calm 
extends  for  Initiative  yards  from  the  vessel,  and  if  the  ship  is 
propelled by some other method, such as oars, the area of calm 
travels with it.

Drowned Man’s Face
Range: Fellowship yards 
Target: 1
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
You  implore  Manann  to  drown  your  foes.  Your  targets’  lungs 
continuously  fill  with  saltwater  while  the  Miracle  is  active,  and 
their hair floats around their head as if submerged. Your targets gains 
a Fatigued  Condition,  and  are  subject  to  the  rules  for  Drowning 
and  Suffocation  (page  181)  while  the  Miracle  is  in  effect.  When 
the Miracle ends, your targets must attempt a Challenging (–20) 
Endurance Test. If a Failure is scored, also inflict a Prone Condition. 

Fair Winds
Range: Initiative Bonus Miles 
Target: 1 sailing vessel within Line of Sight
Duration: 1 Hour
The target vessels’ sails fill with favourable winds, speeding them 
safely towards their destination. While this Miracle is active, the 
sailing vessel moves at top speed, no matter the prevailing wind, 
tide, or current, and all Tests made to steer the vessel gain a bonus 
of +10.

Manann’s Bounty
Range: Touch 
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
You  implore  Manann  to  provide  you  with  sustenance.  Reaching 
into a body of water you catch enough fish to feed 1 person; if you 
reach into the sea, you provide enough fish for 2 people. For every 
+2 SL, you may feed another person.

Sea Legs
Range: Fellowship yards 
Target: 1
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Your  targets  are  immediately  drenched  in  saltwater,  and  reel  as 
if  on  the  rolling  deck  of  a  tempest-tossed  vessel. Their  hair  is 
whipped  by  spectral  winds,  and  a  torrent  of  spray  lashes  their 
skin. They gain one each of the Blinded, Deafened, and Fatigued 
Conditions, and must attempt an Average (+20) Agility Test to 
use their Move. If they fail, they also gain a Prone Condition. 

Waterwalk 
Range: You 
Target: You
Duration: Fellowship Bonus minutes
You call on Manann to allow you to cross a stretch of open water 
as if it were solid ground. This only works on larger bodies of water 
that are at least 10 yards wide. Anything smaller is too far removed 
from Manann’s domain for it to be noticed. 

miRaCles of moRR

Death Mask
Range: You 
Target: You
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Morr works through you, piercing the Portal to make his presence 
known to your foes. Your visage takes on a cadaverous mien, and 
you gain Fear 1. 

Destroy Undead
Range: You
Target: Area of Effect
Duration: Instant
You  call  the  power  of  Morr  to  smite  all  Undead.  A  black  fire 
ripples  forth  from  your  body  in  a  perfect  circle  for  Fellowship 
Bonus  yards.  All  potential  targets  with  the Undead  Creature 
Trait  lose  1d10  Wounds,  ignoring  Toughness  Bonus  and  AP. 
Any Undead destroyed by this Miracle can never be raised with 
Necromancy  again  under  normal  conditions.  For  every  +2  SL, 
you may increase the area of effect by +Fellowship Bonus yards. 

Dooming
Range: Touch 
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
Gazing deeply into your target’s eyes while muttering a threnody 
to Morr, you are granted a vision of the target’s Doom, a glimpse of 
what the future holds. This is almost always related to the target’s 
death. This Miracle may only be performed on a character once, 
after which the Doomed Talent may be purchased with XP as if it 
were in the target’s Career.

Last Rites
Range: 1 yard
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
You  chant a solemn  requiem over a corpse. This  miracle  ensures 
that  the  soul  is  sent  through  the  portal  to  Morr’s  realm,  and 
guarantees the cadaver may not be targeted by any Necromantic 
spells. If the Miracle targets a foe with the Undead and Construct 
Creature Traits, it will be destroyed.

Portal’s Threshold
Range: Touch
Target: Area of Effect
Duration: Special
You draw a line up to 8 yards long on the ground while incanting a 
dirge to Morr. Upon enacting the Miracle, an indistinct, shadowy 
portal seems to manifest to the hoarse croaking of ravens. Creatures 
with  the Undead  Creature  Trait  must  pass  a  Challenging  (+0) 
Willpower Test to cross the line. Creatures with both Undead and 
Construct  simply  cannot  cross  the  line. The  Miracle  remains  in 
effect until dawn. 

Stay Morr’s Hand
Range: Touch 
Target: 1
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Hours (Special)
You touch the eyes of someone close to death and request Morr 
guide  the  soul  within,  but  not  take  it.  The  target  must  have  0 
Wounds and be willing. For the duration of the Miracle, the target 
gains  the Unconscious  Condition  and  will  not  deteriorate  until 
the  Miracle  ends,  staving  off  disease,  ignoring  critical  wounds 
and  poisons,  and  similar.  This  miracle  comes  to  an  end  should 
appropriate  healing  be  provided,  or  should  you  perform  the  last 
rights.  If  you  do  this,  which  takes  about  a  minute,  the  target’s 
soul will pass through Morr’s portal upon death, and the resulting 
corpse may never be targeted by Necromancy.

miRaCles of myRmidia

Blazing Sun
Range: You
Target: Area of Effect
Duration: Instant
You  call  on  Myrmidia  to  scour  the  battlefield  of  dishonourable 
foes,  and  a  blinding  flash  of  golden  light  bursts  forth.  All  non-
Myrmidians looking in your direction receive 1 Blinded Condition. 
For every +2 SL, they receive +1 Blinded Condition. 

Eagle’s Eye
Range: Fellowship yards 
Target: You
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
You  call  on  Myrmidia  to  send  a  Divine  Servant  to  grant  you 
knowledge  of  your  enemies.  A  spectral  Eagle  manifests,  soaring 
into the sky above. The eagle looks like and has the capabilities of a 

223

VII

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

normal eagle, but cannot physically affect the world, or be harmed 
in  any  way.  While  the  Miracle  is  in  effect,  you  can  see  through 
the eagle’s eyes and control its flight, surveying the battlefield and 
spying  upon  your  enemies.  Your  vision  is  acute,  but  you  do  not 
have access to any of your own sense-enhancing Talents such as 
Night Vision. While looking through the eagle’s eyes, you cannot 
see through your own eyes, leaving you potentially vulnerable.

Fury’s Call
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: Intelligence Bonus allies
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Your passionate prayers instil your allies with a furious disdain for 
their foes. All allies affected receive the Hatred Psychology towards 
any engaging them in combat.

Inspiring
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: Intelligence Bonus allies
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Your rousing prayers inspire discipline and coordination within the 
ranks. Affected targets gain the +1 Drilled Talent.

Shield of Myrmidia
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: Intelligence Bonus allies
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Your  stalwart  prayers  incite  Myrmidia  to  shield  your  allies  in 
glittering,  gossamer  strands  of  light,  warding  enemy  blows.  All 
those affected gain +1 AP on all locations.

Spear of Myrmidia
Range: You 
Target: You
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
If  wielding  a  spear,  it  gains  the Impact  Quality,  and  counts  as  
Magical.

miRaCles of Ranald

An Invitation
Range: 1 yard
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
You spin one of Ranald’s riddles concerning portals, and whether 
they exist if closed. A door, window, or hatch you target has one 
method of securing it undone — a lock unlocks, a latch unlatches, 
a rope unties. For every +2 SL you may target another method of 
securing the door, window, or hatch. 

Cat’s Eyes
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: You
Duration: Fellowship Bonus Rounds
Does anything exist that cannot be seen? You riddle with Ranald, 
who sends a Divine Servant in the form of a cat as an answer. The 
cat looks like and has the capabilities of a normal cat, but cannot 
be harmed in any way. While the Miracle is in effect, you perceive 

everything the cat perceives — sight, sound, touch — and control 
its movement. Your senses are as sharp as a cat’s, but you do not 
have access to any of your own sense-enhancing Talents such as 
Night Vision. While the Miracle is in effect, you cannot perceive 
anything through your own senses, leaving you vulnerable. 

Ranald’s Grace
Range: Touch 
Target: 1

You call on Ranald to let your target negotiate the riddles of reality. 
Your target gains +10 Agility, +10 Stealth, and +1 Catfall Talent for

wealth? For each target affected, choose one option:

the target’s purse appears empty
the target’s purse appears full 
the target’s attire appears cheap and unremarkable

For every +2 SL you may select an additional effect for one of your 
targets.

Crossing  your  fingers,  you  pose  Ranald’s  enigma  and  ask  what, 
exactly, is luck? Gain +1 Fortune point. For every +2 SL you may

attention to themselves, such as touching, attacking, calling out to 
someone,  casting  a  spell,  or  making  a  loud  noise.  You  may  only 
invoke this Miracle if no-one is looking directly at you.

person to grow. The type of food depends on your location: in a 
cavern you may grow mushrooms, while outdoors you may cause 
many different fruits and vegetables to spring forth. 

Rhya’s Shelter
Range: You 
Target: You
Duration: Special
You sing one of Rhya’s hymns concerning shelter and safety. You 
may only invoke this Miracle outdoors and outside settlements. You 
discover a perfect natural shelter. Some combination of earth, and 
trees has formed a perfect location to camp for the night. The spot 
is protected from all naturally occurring wind and rain, and lasts as 
long as you remain camped there. The shelter is large enough for 1 
person. For every +2 SL it fits another individual. When you break 
camp, the shelter cannot be rediscovered, as though it only existed 
through your goddess’s will.

Rhya’s Succour
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: Fellowship Bonus allies
Duration: Instant
You chant Rhya’s song of revitalisation. All affected targets have

Toughness  Bonus  is  doubled  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  the 
Wounds suffered from that Damage.

Shallya’s Tears
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Special
You passionately appeal to Shallya to spare a poor, wounded soul 
as  tears  flow  freely  down  your  cheeks.  You  pray  for  10  –  your 
Fellowship Bonus Rounds, at which point you heal the target of

Wound. If your prayer is interrupted, the target receives no benefit.

Unblemished Innocence
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
Laying  hands  on  the  afflicted,  you  beg  Shallya  to  rid  them  of 
recently acquired corruption. The target loses 1 Corruption point, 
and can lose another per +2 SL scored. However, the Chaos Gods 
do not like to be so directly opposed. Should an attempt to invoke 
the Miracle Fumble, you and the target both gain 1d10 Corruption 
points on top of any other effects. This Miracle must be enacted 
within an hour of the target gaining a Corruption point.

‘Keep your cannons, you nulner idiot! We don’t need them.’

– thyrus Gorman, patriarch of the Bright order

Magical  abilities  mark  you  as  a  figure  of  terror  and  awe  in  the 
Empire.  Prior  to  the  establishment  of  the  Colleges  of  Magic 
in  Altdorf,  those  able  to  wield  magic  were  reviled  outlaws. 
Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without 
a licence is. Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at 
the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one 
notices  their  illicit  activity.  Even  licenced  wizards  are  generally 
feared and avoided — legal status has done nothing to reduce the 
superstitious dread of the common folk.

Magic  is  seen  as  unnatural  and  is  notorious  for  its  darker 
elements:  the  crippling  hexes  of  witchcraft,  the  raising  of  the 
dead,  and  the  summoning  of  Daemonic  entities.  Even  when 
practiced  according  to  the  teaching  of  the  Colleges,  magic  can 
be the cause of trouble. The very source of magic is unstable, and 
even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in 
dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects.

the AethyR

Scholars  of  magic  derive  their  learning  from  the  Elves,  who 
explained  the  source  of  all  magical  power  is  the  Aethyr.  This 
infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons 
and  spirits,  exists  beyond  the  physical  world. The  Elves  taught 

that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was 
torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds 
raw  magic.  These  roiling  energies  —  known  as  the  Winds  of 
Magic — blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in 
great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land 
and the creatures dwelling upon it. It is these powerful winds that 
wizards and witches use to fuel their spells.

The winds of magiC
As  magical  power  bursts  into  the  mortal  realm  and  sweeps 
down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting 
through  a  prism. The  Colleges  of  Magic  state  this  creates  eight 
discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character 
and  strengths.  The  Elves  support  this,  teaching  the  same  eight 
winds  to  their  apprentices  before  moving  on  to  more  powerful 
magics.

Only  a  small  minority  of  Humans  can  perceive  the Winds,  and 
even fewer can bend them to their will. Most Elves are sensitive 
to  them,  and  many  possess  the  ability  to  see  the  Winds  clearly 
— commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight — with 
many also able to learn how to cast magic. Dwarfs disdain magic, 
perhaps  because  they  are  partially  immune  to  it,  and  no  Dwarf 
wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic: 
except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.

The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human 
spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They 

What Is the aethyr?
there is much heated debate between ‘experts’ on the nature of magic. the lecture halls of the empire’s most learned institutions 
often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories. some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms, 
props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience. others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with 
incomprehensible esoteric diagrams. Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs, 
raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions.

229

VIII

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

argued  that  while  it  is  possible  to  cast  spells  by  drawing  from 
multiple  winds,  doing  so  is  a  risky  proposition  for  the  feeble, 
corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the 
Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour. 

Spells  from  the  Lore  of  Light  are  some  of  the  most  powerful, 
including piercing rays of blinding light, and those that banish 
Daemons and Undead creatures from the mortal plane. There are 
also more gentle applications of Hysh used to heal comrades or 
clarify thought.

Some  witches  outside  the  College  system  consider  these 
restrictions  ludicrous,  an  attempt  by  the  Elves  to  keep  the  most 
powerful  magics  to  themselves.  Drawing  on  multiple  winds  is  a 
quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed 
witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually 
called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters. 

Others  believe  magical  energies  are  not  so  easily  categorised. 
Many  different  types  of  ‘wizard’  and  ‘witch’  can  be  found 
throughout  the  Old  World,  with  some  practicing  magic  that 
seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice 
Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst 
some  of  the  other  species  besetting  the  Empire,  such  as  the 
Greenskins.

The langUage of magiCk
The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but 
they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of 
Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds 
are  uttered  by  those  attuned  to  magic,  the  Winds  answer. The 
Colleges  of  Magic  teach  a  complex  language  called  the lingua 
praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught 
to  Humanity  by  the  Elves.  Although  extraordinarily  difficult 
to  correctly  annunciate,  it  is  a  significant  simplification  of  the 
Elven tongue Anoqeyån, the language used by the Elves to shape 
their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and 
the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of 
Magick.  Its  complex  forms  are  also  spoken  by  many  magical 
creatures  found  across  the  Old  World,  including  Spirits  and 
Daemons.  Many  witches  seem  to  instinctively  understand  the 
language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging 
to be spoken as a spell.

The eighT loRes
Each  of  the  eight  Winds  of  Magic  has  an  associated  Lore,  a 
body  of  spells  and  knowledge  its  adepts  use.  Each  of  the  eight 
Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and 
their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate 
relatively safe tuition. 

The Lore of Light
The Lore of Light relates to Hysh, the white wind. 
Hysh  is  considered  the  most  difficult  Wind  to 
perceive and manipulate, appearing diffuse even to 
those skilled with the Sight. This makes it tricky to manipulate 
but less unpredictable than other Winds. Hysh is associated with 
patience, intelligence, and purity. The Hierophants of the Light 
Order are acclaimed for their discipline, knowledge, and devoted 
opposition to Chaos.

The Lore of Metal
The  Lore  of  Metal  relates  to Chamon,  the  gold 
wind. Chamon appears dense and heavy to Second 
Sight, sinking into the earth and coalescing within 
dense metals such as lead and gold. The Alchemists of the Gold 
Order  have  a  reputation  for  being  unusually  prosaic  in  their 
attitudes for wizards, and many are as interested in learning the 
facts of physics and chemistry as they are in the working of magic.

230

m aG I c

VIII

elemental forces, blasting their enemies with bolts of lightning, or 
even drawing down shooting stars from the heavens.

Spells from the Lore of Metal often involve the transmutation 
or  alteration  of  metal.  On  the  battlefield,  alchemists  have  been 
known  to  cause  fine  steel  armour  and  weaponry  to  corrode  or 
melt, to weigh their foes down with suddenly dense armour, or to 
enchant their allies’ weaponry with uncanny power. 

The Lore of Life
The Lore of Life relates to Ghyran, the jade wind. 
Free  flowing Ghyran  is  associated  with  growth, 
fertility and nourishment. To those with The Sight, 
Ghyran appears much like a light rain, falling to the ground and 
pooling in eddying swirls. It sinks into the soil and is drawn up 
into the roots of plants from where it goes on to nourish all living 
things. The Druids of the Jade Order often prefer life away from 
the cities, attuned to the seasons and the natural world. 

The Lore of Shadows
The  Lore  of  Shadows  relates  to Ulgu,  the  grey 
wind. To the Sight it appears a thick fog, gathering 
in pools wherever intrigue and deceit are practiced, 
rising into great storms and tempests when conflict breaks out.  
Wizards  of  the  Grey  Order,  known  as  Grey  Guardians,  are 
secretive in their ways and given to uncertain loyalties. Despite 
this,  the  Grey  Order  is  renowned  for  its  wisdom  and  skill  in 
negotiations, and is often called upon for diplomatic missions. 

Spells  from  the  Lore  of  Life  commonly  involve  healing  and 
rejuvenation,  from  healing  wounds  to  causing  a  barren  field  to 
burst  with  life.  They  can  have  offensive  applications,  too.  The 
enemies of a Druid may find themselves suddenly tangled up in 
wickedly sharp brambles and vines.

The Lore of Heavens
The  Lore  of  Heavens  relates  to Azyr,  the  blue 
wind.  It  cascades  through  the  skies  over  the  Old 
World, crackling through the heavens, like a great 
charged cloud. Astromancers of the Celestial Order, known for 
their calm and contemplative manners, use the wind to scry the 
future, the lens of Azyr influencing what they can see in the stars.

Spells from the Lore of Heavens involve the manipulation of fate, 
throwing up protective barriers, or cursing a foe with an unnatural 
run  of  bad  luck.  On  the  battlefield,  Astromancers  also  control

Bright  wizards  are  also  adept  at  inspiring  their  allies,  rallying 
their courage and inspiring bravery and loyalty in the troops with 
which they serve. 

Spells  from  the  Lore  of  Shadows  can  be  used  to  mask  or 
obfuscate,  confusing  and  disorienting  their  foes.  In  battle,  the 
shadowy,  insubstantial  tendrils  of Ulgu  they  wield  can  pierce 
to  the  heart  of  their  foes,  eviscerating  the  most  well-protected 
troops, yet leaving armour eerily intact. 

The Lore of Death
The  Lore  of  Death  relates  to Shyish,  the  purple 
wind.  It  is  attracted  to  places  of  death,  such 
as  battlefields,  Gardens  of  Morr,  and  sites  of 
execution.  The  wind  is  said  to  blow  strongest  during  times  of 
transition, so wizards of the Amethyst Order tend to work their 
greatest rites during the twilight before dawn, or during sunset. 
While Shyish is related to time and mortality, it is distinct from 
Necromancy, the illegal practice of raising and binding the dead, 
which uses the dark magic of Dhar in lieu of Shyish. Indeed, the 
Amethyst Order, much like the Cult of Morr, works tirelessly to 
combat the threat of Necromancy. 

The Lore of Beasts
The  Lore  of  Beasts  relates  to Ghur,  the  amber 
wind,  a  cold,  primal  force  associated  with  the 
savage wilds and the beasts living there. To those 
with  the  Sight Ghur  seems  to  blow  weakly  in  areas  where  the 
wilderness has been tamed and settlements constructed. This may 
explain why the Shamans of the Amber Order often take up a 
hermitic existence and shun their fellow men.

Nevertheless, spells from the Lore of Death resemble Necromancy 
to  the  untrained  eye. They  can  drain  their  targets  of  life  force, 
spread fear among their enemies, and contact the spirits of the 
departed.

The Lore of Fire
The  Lore  of  Fire  relates  to Aqshy,  the  red  wind. 
Aqshy  is  a  hot  and  searing  wind  associated  with 
brashness, courage, and zeal and is drawn to empirical 
heat.  The  Pyromancers  of  the  Bright  Order  are  bold  and  hot-
tempered  and  make  for  impressively  destructive  Battle Wizards.

Many of the spells from the Lore of Fire are offensive in nature, 
enabling the caster to conjure up great balls of fire, or cause the 
blades of their allies to burst into flame. Even their non-offensive 
spells, such as crude healing magics, are still destructive in nature. 

The spells of the Lore of Beasts allow a Shaman to communicate 
with animals, request their aid, and even summon them to battle. 
Shapeshifting  magic  may  also  be  used  by  the  wizard  to  adopt 
animal forms.

elven magiC
Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the 
workings  of  magic  than  those  of  humanity.  High  Elven  mages 
usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part 
of  their  apprenticeships,  before  the  most  promising  move  on 
to study High Magic: Qhaysh. This is the blending of multiple 
winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy. This 
magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the 
capacity of humankind. 

The  Wood  Elves,  too,  make  use  of  the  eight  Winds  of  Magic, 
though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber 
Winds. The  most  powerful  usually  go  on  to  study  either  High 
Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic – a foul mixing of 
the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects.

daRk magiC
While difficult to master Qhaysh is the safe blending of multiple 
Winds  of  Magic, Dhar,  known  commonly  as  Dark  Magic,  is 
much  more  dangerous  method  of  casting  spells  using  multiple 
winds. It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers, 
and  powerful  witches,  offering  them  a  seductive  source  of  raw 
power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects. Few can channel 
Dhar for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of 
the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into 
unnatural states. 

Dhar resembles a stagnant mire to those with the Sight, pooling 
in  places  saturated  with  evil,  or  corruption:  the  herdstones  of 
Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great 
workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place. Dhar is so 
dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize 
into  physical  matter,  eventually  forming  the  widely  feared 
substance called warpstone.

Warpstone
Warpstone  is  a  lump  of  pure  magic  in  the  material  plane.  Its 
unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as 
it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long. 
Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and 
radiates a queasy green glow.

oTheR loRes
In  less  frequented  corners  of  the  Empire,  in  villages  and  rural 
communities  far  from  the  influence  of  the  Colleges  of  Magic, 
older  forms  of  magic  are  still  practiced  even  though  they  are 
outlawed and punishable by death. There are uncounted varieties 
of  these,  but  two  of  the  more  common  Lores  still  practised  by 
Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft.

The Lore of Hedgecraft
Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes 
of  smaller  human  settlements,  in  service  to  local  communities. 
Just as they live their lives in the ‘hedge’ between civilisation and 
the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with 
the  liminal  space  between  the  material  world  and  the  realm  of 
the  spirits.   Their  magic  tends  to  focus  on  folklore,  spirits  and 
the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities 
which  shelter  them.  Once  a  relatively  common  sight  in  the 
Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of 
the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out. 

The Lore of Witchcraft
While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied 
to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and 
unpleasantness. Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of 
Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline 
or knowledge of College wizards and are at a significant risk of 
corruption. The combination of the corrosive effects of Dhar and 
being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes 
these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty, 
their gaze baleful and ill-omened.

mAgic RuleS

seCond sighT
The Second Sight Talent (see page 144) allows you to perceive 
the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around 
you.  Second  Sight  affects  all  your  senses,  and  how  it  manifests 
is  dependent  on  individual  experience  and  training:  So,  where 
Aqshy  may  have  a  hot,  cinnamon  odour  to  one  pyromancer,  it 
could feel like searing ear itches to another.

Close  examination  of  the  substance  is  not  to  be  undertaken 
lightly. Warpstone  is  the  stuff  of  Chaos  made  manifest  and  its 
presence  is  deeply  corrupting.  Those  who  have  direct  contact 
with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone 
who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to 
catastrophic warping of body and mind. Nonetheless, the world 
is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and 
dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells 
and rituals.

The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it. 
To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued 
above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies.

If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with 
your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception, 
and Track Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a 
fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces 
of Dhar in the witch’s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or 
a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally 
could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the 
mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which 
is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have 
no  truck  with  the Winds  of  Magic  but  cannot  help  what  they 
perceive. This  means  the  GM  may  request Tests,  or  take Tests 
on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your 
surrounding environment, even if you’re not looking for them.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

spells
There  are  four  types  of  spell:  Petty,  Arcane,  Lore,  and  Chaos 
spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts 
of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying 
any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you 
can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the 
Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos 
spells  are  those  practiced  by  those  who’ve  lost  their  souls  to 
Chaos.

Memorising Spells
Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick) 
in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into 
your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell. 

To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without 
access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount 
of  XP  noted  in  your  spellcasting Talent  (see  Chapter 4: Skills 
and Talents).  Once  a  spell  has  been  memorised,  a  spellcaster 
knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.

CasTing TesT
To cast a spell, make a Language (Magick) Test. If you succeed, 
match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in 
the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than 
the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell’s description. 
If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.

Critical Casting
If the casting roll is a Critical (see page 159), the Winds of Magic 
have  flared  dangerously  high,  granting  you  extra  power,  but  at 
a cost. Unless you have  the Instinctive Diction Talent,  you  roll 
on  the  Minor  Miscast Table  as  the  power  moves  beyond  your 
control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:

•	 Critical Cast: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a 

Critical Wound. See page 172 for details.

•	 Total Power: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your 

•	

rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.
Unstoppable Force: If you scored enough SL to cast your 
spell, it cannot be Dispelled.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Fumbled Casting
If  you  lose  control  of  the  magical  energy  you  are  channelling, 
things  invariably  go  awry.  If  you  Fumble  your  Casting Test,  you 
suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the Minor Miscast Table.

Ingredients
Spellcasters  may  channel  their  magic  through  an  appropriate 
ingredient  before  unleashing  their  spells.  Doing  this  offers 
protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the 
worst of any magical backlash. 

malIGnant InFluences
casting  close  to  sources  of  corruption  makes  controlling 
the Winds of Magic much more difficult. When attempting 
a language (magick) or channelling test in the vicinity of 
a  Corrupting  Influence  (see  page  182),  any  roll  of  an  8 
(representing the eight-pointed symbol of chaos) on the units 
die results in a minor miscast as the magic goes wild. If you 
already have a minor miscast on the test for another reason, 
the miscast escalates to a major miscast.

Duration
If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration 
unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already 
in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them. 

If  you  use  an  ingredient  when  casting,  any  suffered  Major 
Miscast  becomes  a  Minor  Miscast,  and  any  Minor  Miscast 
has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or 
destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.

Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore 
spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your 
character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for 
specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking 
to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each 
of  the  primary  Lores  of  Magic  are  provided  by  the  individual 
spell lists.

Limitations
As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged, 
strangled, or underwater — to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the 
Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should 
be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs 
to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly, 
and  often  loudly,  to  ensure  spells  work;  magic  is  anything  but 
subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder 
the spell is chanted.

Grimoires
Some  spellcasters  own  a  spellbook,  or  grimoire,  in  which  they 
transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master, 
while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from 
other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may 
cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore 
they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.

Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have 
to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before 
using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or 
penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty 
is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell 
providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10 
Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.

Magic Missiles
Some  spells  are  marked  as magic missiles;  these  are  damage-
causing  spells  that  all  follow  the  same  rules.  When  a magic 
missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit 
Location  struck  is  determined  by  reversing  the  dice  rolled  on 
the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location 
Table (see page 159). The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is 
added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to 
determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by 
the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as normal. 

Touch Spells in Combat
Certain  spells  require  you  to  touch  the  target.  If  in  combat, 
or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an 
Opposed  Melee  (Brawling)  Test  (generally  opposed  by  the 
Melee  or  Dodge  Skill)  after  completing  the  Casting  Test. 
If  you  do  this  and  your  spell  was  a magic missile,  the  Melee 
(Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not 
the Language (Magick) Test.

Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to 
see — i.e. have Line of Sight — to your target.

advantaGe and maGIc
advantage in combat applies to casting tests, not channelling 
tests. When casting magic, you can also gain advantage in 
the following way: If the target has already had a spell from 
the same lore cast upon it in that round, gain +1 advantage 
as you cast, as the upswelling of your Wind aids channelling 
magic. see page 164 for advantage rules.

VIII

Channelling TesT
Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally 
be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such 
spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate 
them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill. 
Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure, 
but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel 
magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test. 

When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have 
channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can 
cast  your  spell  using  the  normal  Casting  rules,  but  count  the 
chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you 
also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor 
Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.

Critical Channelling
If  you  roll  a  Critical  when  Channelling,  you  have  channelled 
a  mighty  flow  of  magic  and  can  cast  your  spell  next  Round 
regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far; 
however,  so  much  magic  so  quickly  concentrated  in  one  place 
results  in  some  magical  backlash:  roll  1d100  on  the  Minor 
Miscast Table unless you have the Aethyric Attunement Talent 
(see page 132).

Fumble
Channelling  the Winds  of  Magic  in  a  large  flow  is  dangerous. 
You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a 
Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling 
Test,  you  suffer  a  Miscast.  Roll  1d100  and  consult  the  Major 
Miscast Table.

Interruptions
Concentration  is  vital  when  channelling.  If  you  are  distracted 
by  anything  —  loud  noises,  suffering  damage,  flashing  lights, 
or similar — you must pass a Hard (–20) Cool Test, or suffer a 
Minor Miscast and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended 
Channelling Test so far.

Repelling The winds
Wearing  colours  appropriate  to  the  Wind  of  Magic  you  are 
manipulating  helps  attract  the  magic  to  you.  This  is  the  reason 
most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order. 

All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you 
are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying 
to  attract,  as  determined  by  the  GM.  Specifically,  metal  and 
leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the 
golden wind Chamon, while leather retains traces of the amber 
Ghur. As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty 
to  all  Casting  and  Channelling  Tests  for  every  Armour  Point 
on the location with the most armour. Casters with the Arcane 
Magic (Metal) Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; 
those  with Arcane Magic (Beasts) Talent  may  ignore  penalties 
from leather armour. 

dispelling
If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards, 
you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you 
chant a counterspell. Make an Opposed Language (Magick) Test. 
If  you  win  the  Opposed  Test,  you  dispel  the  incoming  spell;  if 
you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine 
whether  the  casting  was  successful  as  normal.  You  may  only 
attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.

Dispelling Persistent Spells
If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell 
for your Action. This is done by making an Extended Language 
(Magick) Test. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing 
spell, you successfully dispel it.

Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll 
separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to 
make an Assisted Test instead.

Using waRpsTone
Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be. 
Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this 
college. Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have. But 
unofficially, I might be able to say it has certain unofficial uses. But 
certainly it is officially unofficial.

Warpstone is such a rich source of power that even a small fragment of the stuff will offer enough magic to power any spell in short order. Of course, the wisdom of powering any spell with Warpstone, and the wisdom of carrying Warpstone upon your person, is debateable. A wizard using Warpstone when Casting and Channelling doubles their SL for the appropriate tests. In addition, Casting or Channelling with Warpstone is a corrupting influence. See page 182 for details of Corruption, and page 236 for casting near Malignant Influences.Multiple ArcAne loresif you’re an elf, you can learn a number of Arcane lores equal to your Willpower Bonus. if you have Willpower 65, you can learn 6 of the 8 Arcane lores. However, doing this takes time and effort. You can’t purchase a new Arcane Magic talent until you have mastered your previous one by taking at least 20 Advances in the channelling skill of, and learning at least 8 spells from, your lore. Alternatively, any wizard can learn a single Dark lore in addition to another lore, assuming they are foolish enough and can find a teacher or forbidden grimoire to study.options: tHe sWirling WinDsthe Winds of Magic swirl in unfathomable patterns and unpredictable gusts.

The modifier can be added to your casting and channelling tests. the gM could decide to do this only in areas where the Winds of Magic are particularly wild, for example in the aftermath of powerful spells, at magical loci, near chaotic portals, and when Morrslieb is at its fullest. if you have the second sight talent, an Easy (+40) Perception test will spot such disturbances.1d10Modifier1–302-3–104-7–8-9+1010+30SPEll liStSPetty spells are listed first, followed by Arcane spells, then the 8 Elemental Lores (Colour Magic), then 2 Witch Lores, followed by 2 Dark Lores, and finally 1 spell for each of the 3 Chaos Lores.

Spells with a Range and Target of ‘You’ may only ever target the spellcaster making the Casting Test. Spells with a Range of ‘Touch’ may not be extended. If the Spell has no Duration, you cannot extend it. You may choose the same option more than once. For instance, if you achieved + 4 SL above your Casting Number on a spell with a Target of 1, you may now Target 3 individuals. Certain Spells may have additional, optional benefits for additional SL noted in their description.griMoiresif you start play with a grimoire, it is up to the gM to determine how many spells your master has recorded within it. some Masters are more generous than others, but most provide at least four new spells to study, and few provide more than eight. if you have a spell Memorised, you do not need access to your grimoire to cast it. if you have not yet memorised a spell, you may use your grimoire to cast it using both your hands. this doubles the cn of the spell and exposes your grimoire to possible damage or theft.m aG I c

the colleGes oF maGIc 
and petty spells
petty spells, or cantrips as the colleges often prefer to call 
them, use miniscule amounts of whatever winds are around, 
and are often learned instinctively by spellcasters as their talent 
first manifests. As such, once their training within the Colleges 
has begun, Wizards rarely learn new petty spells. technically, 
they  are  classed  as  Witchcraft,  and  are  thus  illegal  in  the 
empire. 

While the colleges of magic generally turn a blind eye to 
their  use  given  they  are  so  minor,  Witch  hunters  are  not 
always so understanding.

peTTy spells
For the few Humans blessed — or cursed, depending upon your 
point of view — with the spark of magic, it generally manifests 
around  puberty,  and  almost  always  before  25  summers  have 
passed.  The  first  indications  of  impending  witchery  are  often 
little tricks, knacks, cantrips, or similar, showing the wizard-to-be 
should probably be trained for everyone else’s safety. 

Bearings
CN: 0
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Instant
You sense the influx of the Winds of Magic from their source. 
You know which direction North is. 

For Elves, this is just a part of growing up, and those with interest 
in  magic  are  schooled  to  develop  their  burgeoning  talents.  For 
Humans,  assuming  they  avoid  being  lynched,  it  likely  means 
years  of  training  as  an  apprentice  to  a  wizard  from  one  of  the 
Eight Colleges of Magic, after which they should never use the 
little tricks they learned when young again. But most do. 

As  Petty  spells  are  not  formally  codified,  they  have  many 
different names. Players are encouraged to devise their own, more 
characterful names, reflecting their personality.

through rural terrain suffer a –30 penalty to their Tests. 

Conserve

Range: 1 yard
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus days

to  find  in  the  vicinity,  such  as  a  rabbit,  dove,  or  rat.  If  there

awaken  them  instantly.  If  your  targets  are  standing  or  sitting 
when affected, they start themselves awake as they hit the ground,

Target: Special
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  create  small  noises  nearby.  You  can  create  quiet,  indistinct 
noises that sound as if they come from a specific location within 
range, regardless of line of sight. The noises can evoke something 
specific, such as footsteps, whispers or the howl of an animal, but 
nothing so distinct that it might convey a message. 

While the spell is active, you may control the sounds by passing 
a  Average  (+20)  Channelling  Test.  A  success  allows  you  to 
move the sounds to another point within range, or to increase or 
decrease their volume. 

Twitch
CN: 0
Range: Willpower Bonus yards

Range: 1 yard
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
You channel magic into an object, noticing immediately if it has 
been poisoned or trapped. 

aRCane spells
The Arcane spells represent common formulations of the lingua 
praestantia. How these spells manifest in practice will depend on 
your Arcane Magic Talent.  For  instance,  a  spellcaster  with  the 
Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent casting Drop may cause the object to 
overheat, while one with Arcane Magic (Shadows) may make it 
slightly insubstantial, causing the object to literally slip between 
the target’s fingers. 

Treat  Arcane  spells  as  extra  options  for every  Lore  of  Magic, 
including Witch,  Dark,  and  Chaos  Lores. They  are  counted  as 
Lore spells in all ways, meaning they get all the benefits of Lore 
spells, and can only be learned from and taught to those sharing 
the same Arcane Magic Talent.

Note:  Any  spell  marked  with  a  ‘+’  at  the  end  of  the  Duration 
gains  the  following  extra  text: When  the  spell  should  end,  you 
may make a Willpower Test to extend the Duration for +1 round.

Aethyric Armour
CN: 2

most  will  be  curious  enough  to  hear  you  out. You  gain  +20  on 
all Charm Animal and Animal Training Tests While this spell 
is active, you may only speak with beasts — you may not speak 
any civilised tongues, and can only communicate with your party

colouR mAgic

The following provides eight lists of eight spells, with one list for 
each colour of magic.

The loRe of BeasTs
The Amber wind, Ghur, carries with it a chill, primal 
ferocity,  that  is  unnerving  to  beasts  and  sentient 
creatures  alike.  Whenever  you  successfully  cast 
a  spell  from  the  Lore  of  Beasts,  you  may  also  gain  the Fear (1) 
Creature Trait (see page 190) for the next 1d10 Rounds. 

Ingredients:  Shamans  use  animal  fur,  skin,  bone,  and  pelt, 
wrapped  in  sinews  and  daubed  with  blood  runes  to  focus  the 
Amber  wind.  Often  claws  are  scrimshawed,  organs  dried,  and 
feathers dipped in rare humours, and it’s not uncommon to find 
excrement, urine, and other excretions also used.

Amber Talons

You  infuse  your  very  bones  and  flesh  with Ghur,  warping  your 
body into that of a creature. When cast, select a new form from 
any of the Beasts of the Reikland section of the Bestiary. Gain all 
the standard Traits of the creature, except the Bestial Trait. Further, 
replace your S, T, Agi, and Dex with those of the creature, then  
recalculate your Wounds. For every + 2 SL, you may include 1 of 
the included Optional Creature Trait. While in Beast Form, you 
look like a normal version of the creature, with amber and brown 
colouring. You may not speak, which means you cannot cast spells, 
or attempt to dispel. If you have lost any Wounds when the spell 
ends,  you  lose  the  same  number  of Wounds  when  you  revert  to 
your true form, to a minimum of 0 Wounds.

Beast Master
CN: 10
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus days
Your breath steams and your eyes take on a shining amber sheen 
as Ghur suffuses you. Your gaze and words convince 1 creature

The Amber Spear

Target: Special
Duration: Instant
You hurl a great spear of pure Ghur in a straight line. This is a 
magic missile with a Damage of +12. It strikes the first creature 
in its path, ignoring APs from armour made of leather and furs. If 
the target suffers any Wounds, also inflict +1 Bleeding Condition, 
after which the spear continues on its path, striking each target in 
the same manner, but at –1 Damage each time. If the spear fails 
to inflict any Wounds, its progress is stopped and the spell comes 
to an end.  The Amber Spear only inflicts the minimum 1 Wound 
(see page 236) on the first target it strikes.

Wyssan’s Wildform
CN: 8
Range: You

Language or Lore skills.

The loRe of deaTh
The  purple  wind  of Shyish  carries  with  it  dry, 
dusty  winds  and  the  insistent  rustling  of  sand 
passing through Time’s hourglass. Targets afflicted 
by spells from the Lore of Death are drained of life, enervated, 
and listless. You may assign +1 Fatigued Condition to any living 
target affected by a spell from this lore. A target may only ever 
have a single Fatigued Condition gained in this manner at any 
one time.

Ingredients: The  bones  of  sentient  creatures  feature  heavily  in 
Amethyst magic, as do the trappings of death, including wood or 
nails from coffins, embalming fluids, hourglasses, silver coins, and 
grave dirt, all carefully presented or engraved. Purple gemstones, 
materials, and flowers (particularly roses) are also common.

1 Wound.

a magic missile  with  a  Damage  of  +10  that  ignores Toughness 
Bonus and Armour Points.

Steal Life
CN: 7
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
Thin  strands  of  purple  mist  connect  you  briefly  to  your  target, 
who wastes away before your very eyes. This  counts  as a magic 
missile with  a  Damage  of  +6  that  ignores  Armour  Points  and 
inflicts +1 Fatigued Condition. Further, you remove all Fatigued 
Conditions you currently suffer, and may heal yourself up to half 
the Wounds the target suffers, rounding up.

Swift Passing
CN: 6
Range: Touch
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
Your  touch  brings  the  release  of  death  to  a  single  mortally 
wounded target. If you successfully touch a target with 0 wounds 
remaining and at least 2 Critical Wounds, death swiftly follows. 
Further, the target cannot be raised as Undead. 

The loRe of fiRe
The Lore of Fire, and the Bright wind of Aqshy, 
is anything but subtle. Its spells are bellowed with 
fervour  and  manifest  themselves  in  bombastic 
fashion, with bright flame and searing heat. You may inflict +1 
Ablaze  Condition  on  anyone  targeted  by  spells  from  the  Lore 
of Fire, unless they also possess the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. 
Every Ablaze condition within Willpower Bonus yards adds +10 
to attempts to Channel or Cast with Aqshy.

Ingredients:  Pyromancers  use  a  wide  selection  of  flammable 
materials as ingredients, which are often immolated as the spell 
is  cast,  including  coal,  oils,  fats,  and  ruddy  woods.  Trappings 
immune  to  fire  are  also  common,  such  as  iron  keys,  carved 
sections of fire-grate, and small oven stones.

Aqshy’s Aegis
CN: 5
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Willpower Bonus rounds
You wrap yourself in a fiery cloak of Aqshy, which channels flame 
into  the  Aegis.  You  are  completely  immune  to  damage  from

The  Firewall  is Willpower  Bonus  yards  wide,  and  1  yard  deep. 
For every +2 SL you may extend the length of the Firewall by 
+Willpower  Bonus  yards.  Anyone  crossing  the  firewall  gains  1 
Ablaze condition and suffers a hit with a Damage equal to your 
Willpower Bonus, handled like a magical missile.

Great Fires of U’Zhul
CN: 10
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You hurl a great, explosive blast of Aqshy into an enemy, which 
erupts into a furious blaze, burning with the heat of a forge. This 
is a magical missile with Damage +10 that ignores Armour Points 
and inflicts +2 Ablaze Conditions and the Prone Condition on a 
target. Everyone within the Area of Effect of that target suffers a 
Damage +5 hit ignoring Armour Points, and must pass a Dodge 
Test or also gain +1 Ablaze Condition. The spell stops behaving 
like a magic missile as the  fire continues to burn in the Area of 
Effect for the duration. Anyone within the Area of Effect at the 
start of a round suffers 1d10+6 Damage, ignoring APs, and gains 
+1 Ablaze Condition. 

Flaming Sword of Rhuin

Purge

Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You funnel intense flame to burn away the taint and corruption

in the area takes +SL Ablaze conditions. If the location contains 
a  Corrupting  Influence,  such  as Dhar,  warpstone,  or  a  Chaos-
tainted  object,  it  too  will  smoulder  and  blacken,  beginning  to 
burn.  This  spell  may  be  maintained  in  subsequent  rounds  by 
passing a Challenging (+0) Channelling Test. The precise time 
needed to eliminate the Corrupting Influence will be determined 
by your GM. As a rough guideline, a small quantity (smaller than 
an  acorn)  of  warpstone,  or  a  minor  Chaos-tainted  object  may 
require  10–Willpower  Bonus  Rounds  (minimum  of  1  Round). 
A larger quantity of warpstone — fist-sized — or a more potent 
Chaos-tainted object may require double this. A powerful Chaos 
Artefact may take hours, or even longer… See page 182 for detail 
on Corrupting Influences.

The loRe of heavens
Arcane  spells  cast  from  the  Lore  of  Heavens  are 
accompanied  by  the  crackling  of  lightning  and 
the smell of ozone. Spells causing Damage ignore 
Armour Points from metal armour, and will arc to all other targets 
within 2 yards, except those with the Arcane Magic (Heavens) 
Talent,  inflicting  hits  with  a  Damage  equal  to  your Willpower 
Bonus, handled like a magical missile.

Ingredients:  Astronomical  instruments,  charts,  lenses,  and 
symbols dominate Celestial magic, as do ingredients associated 
with augury, such as animal innards, mirrors, glass balls, and bird 
tongues. Some wind-based spells use wings and feathers, where 
those involving electricity prefer slivers of carved metal.

seers
the  seer  career  can  gain  access  to  the  arcane magic 
(heavens) talent. seers who take this talent can only take 
these spells (and none other, even arcane spells): Fate’s Fickle 
Fingers, starcrossed, the First portent of amul, the second 
portent of amul, the third portent of amul. to gain access 
to the rest of the arcane magic (heavens) spells, they would 
need to enter the Wizard career.

Cerulean Shield
CN: 7
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  encase  yourself  in  a  crackling  cage  of  sparking  electricity 
and Azyr.  For  the  spell’s  duration,  gain  +SL  Armour  Points  to 
all locations against melee attacks. If attacked by metal weapons 
— such as daggers, swords, and spears  with metal  tips  —  your 
attacker takes +Willpower Bonus Damage. 

Comet of Casandora
CN: 10
Range: Initiative yards
Target: AoE (Initiative Bonus yards)
Duration: Special
You channel all the Azyr you can muster and reach out to the skies, 
calling down a comet to wreak havoc amongst your foes. Select a 
target point within range. At the end of the next round, make an 
Average (+20) Perception Test.  For  every  +SL  you  achieve,  you 
may move your point of impact by Initiative Bonus yards. 

For every –SL, the GM will move the point of impact by Initiative 
Bonus  yards  in  a  random  direction.  Comet  of  Casandora  then 
acts as a magical missile with Damage +12 that hits all targets 
in  the  Area  of  Effect,  who  also  gain  +1 Ablaze  and  the Prone 
Condition. 

Fate’s Fickle Fingers
CN: 6
Range: You
Target: AoE (Initiative Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
All  allies  within  the  Area  of  Effect,  excluding  those  with  the

When  the  spell  ends,  you  reallocate  any  remaining  Fortune 
Points as fairly as possible.

+1 Blinded condition.

CN: 12
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Initiative Bonus Rounds
Gain +1 Fate Point. If the Fate point is not used by the end of the 
Duration, it is lost.

The loRe of meTal
The  wind  of Chamon  is  very  dense,  and  quickly 
attaches  itself  to  metallic  substances.  Spells  from 
this  lore  are  accompanied  with  golden  light  and 
heat,  and  are  especially  effective  against  foes  foolish  enough  to 
encase  themselves  in  metal.  Spells  inflicting  Damage  ignore 
Armour  Points  from  metal  armour,  and  inflict  bonus  Damage 
equal  to  the  number  of  Armour  Points  of  metal  armour  being 
worn  on  any  Hit  Location  struck.  So,  if  your  spell  hit  an  Arm 
location protected by 2 Armour Points of metal armour, it would 
cause an additional +2 Damage and ignore the Armour Points.

Ingredients:  Heavy  metals  of  all  types,  esoterically  inlaid  or 
carved, comprise the majority of Gold ingredients, though many 
spells also use trappings associated with a forge, including sections 
of a bellows marked with mathematical formula, inscribed chunks 
of an anvil, or fragments of a furnace.

Crucible of Chamon
CN: 7
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
You channel Chamon into a single non-magical, metallic object, 
such as a weapon or piece of armour. The item melts, dripping to 
the  floor  as  molten  metal,  cooling  almost  immediately.  If  held, 
the item is dropped. If worn, the wearer takes a hit like a magic 
missile with Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus that ignores 
Toughness Bonus. While the object is destroyed, the metal retains 
its base value, and may be used by a smith as raw material.

(9+) Creature Trait (see page 343) against all attacks and spells

Mutable Metal
CN: 5
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You touch a non-magical object made of metal, which instantly 
becomes warm to the touch as you squeeze Chamon into it. You 
may bend and mangle the object with an Average (+20) Strength 
Test.  If  you  wish  to  make  a  more  complex  alteration,  you  may 
attempt an Average (+20) Trade (Smith, or similar) Test instead. 

Transmutation of Chamon
CN: 12
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  wrench Chamon  from  the  metals  worn  by  your  foes,  and 
the  earth  itself,  briefly  transforming  the  flesh  of  your  enemies 
into  metal. This  is  a magic missile  affecting  all  in  the  Area  of 
Effect, with a Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus; the spell 
ignores Toughness Bonus and inflicts +1 Blinded, Deafened, and 
Stunned Condition, all of which last for the duration of the spell. 
All affected targets gain +1 Armour Point from the gold wrapped 
about their bodies, but also suffer from Suffocation (see page 181). 
If  targets  die  while  the  spell  is  in  effect,  they  are  permanently 
encased in a shell of base metals, a macabre reminder of the risks 
of sorcery.

Enchant Weapon
CN: 6
Range: Touch
Target: special
Duration: Willpower Bonus rounds
You  encase  a  single  non-magical  weapon  with  heavy  bands  of 
Chamon,  enhancing  its  potency.  For  the  duration  of  the  spell 
it  counts  as  magical,  gains  a  bonus  to  Damage  equal  to  your 
Willpower Bonus, and gains the Unbreakable Quality (see page 
298). For every +3 SL you may also add 1 Quality or remove 1 
Flaw from the weapon, while the spell is in effect.

Feather of Lead
CN: 5 
Range: Willpower yards 
Target: Area of Effect (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Calling on the golden wind, you alter the density of your target’s 
belongings, raising or lowering their weight. For the duration of 
the spell, choose one effect for everyone within the area of effect:

•	 Count as two steps more Overburdened
•	 Do not count as Overburdened

See page 293 for details on Encumbrance. 

Fool’s Gold
CN: 4
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower minutes
You  weave Chamon  into  a  non-magical  object  made  of  metal, 
fundamentally  altering  its  alchemical  nature.  For  the  duration 
of the spell, all metal in the object becomes gold. This is not an 
illusion:  it  has  actually  transformed  into  gold.  When  the  spell 
ends,  the  item  reverts  to  its  original  metal. This  spell  can  ruin 
good  weapons,  make  armour  too  heavy  to  wear,  and  turn  lead 
coins into something much more appealing. Spot effects arising 
from this spell are left in the hands of the GM.

Forge of Chamon
CN: 9
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: Special
Duration: Willpower minutes
You  alter  the  quality  of  a  single  item  made  of  metal.  You  may 
add 1 Quality or remove 1 Flaw. For every +2 SL, you may add 
another Quality or remove another Flaw.

Glittering Robe
CN: 5
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Toughness Bonus Rounds
Wild  flurries  of Chamon  whirl  around  you,  deflecting  blows 
and  intercepting  missiles  and  magical  attacks.  Gain  the Ward

The loRe of life
Spells  cast  with  Ghyran,  the  Jade  Wind,  are 
suffuse with life, tending to manifest with a vibrant 
green light, and are often accompanied by natural 
phenomena  given  supernatural  qualities.  Vines,  undergrowth, 
trees, and rivers all bend to the Druids’ wills. 

Receive a +10 bonus to Casting and Channelling rolls when in 
a rural or wilderness environment. Living creatures — e.g. those 
without  the Daemonic  or Undead  Creature Traits  —  targeted 
by  Arcane  Spells  from  the  Lore  of  Life  have  all Fatigued  and 
Bleeding Conditions removed after any other effects have been 
applied  as  life  magic  floods  through  them.  Creatures  with  the 
Undead  Creature  Trait,  on  the  other  hand,  suffer  additional 
Damage  equal  to  your  Willpower  Bonus,  ignoring  Toughness 
Bonus and Armour Points, if affected by any spell cast with the 
Lore of Life.

Ingredients:  Druids  use  a  wide  variety  of  naturally  occurring 
ingredients, ranging from rare seeds and nuts, humours gathered 
from sentient creatures in the flush of life, uncommon tree saps, 
fertile  loam,  spring  waters,  and  a  variety  of  living  ingredients, 
including plants and smaller animals.

Barkskin
CN: 3
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  cause  the  target’s  skin  to  become  hard  and  rough  like  the 
bark of a tree. While affected by the spell, add +2 to the target’s 
Toughness  Bonus,  but  suffer  a  penalty  of  –10  to  Agility  and 
Dexterity. 

Earthblood
CN: 6
Range: You
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
To cast this spell, you must be in direct contact with the earth. 
Standing  barefoot  counts.  For  the  duration  of  the  spell,  any 

creatures  in  direct  contact  with  the  earth  within  AoE  heal 
Wounds  equal  to  your  Willpower  Bonus  at  the  start  of  every 
Round. 

Earthpool
CN: 8
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Instant 
On casting the spell, you immediately disappear into the ground 
in  a  wild  torrent  of Ghyran. You  appear  at  the  start  of  the  next 
Round at any point within your Willpower in yards, erupting from 
the earth violently. For every +2 SL you may increase the distance 
travelled by your Willpower in yards. Any enemies engaged by you 
on your appearance gain the Surprised Condition. This spell will 
not allow you to move through stone but will allow you to move 
through water.

Fat of the Land
CN: 4
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus days
You flood the target’s body with nourishing Ghyran. The target 
need not eat or drink, but will still excrete as normal, though any 
leavings will be verdant green.

Forest of Thorns
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
This  spell  may  only  target  a  patch  of  earth  (though  the  patch 
can  be  very  small).  You  cause  a  dense  knot  of  wickedly  spiked 
brambles and tangled vines to burst upwards, covering the Area 
of Effect.

While the spell is active, anyone attempting to traverse the area 
on  foot  without  the Arcane Magic (Life) Talent  must  make  a 
Hard  (–20)  Agility  Test.  Failure  means  they  gain  1 Bleeding 
Condition,  and  1 Entangled  Condition,  with  your  Willpower 
used  for  its  Strength.  After  the  spell  concludes,  the  growth 
remains, but loses its preternatural properties.

Lie of the Land
CN: 5
Range: Initiative Bonus miles
Target: You
Duration: Special
Touching the earth, your senses flow through the Ghyran tracing 
the  nearby  area.  After  communing  for  1  minute,  you  receive  a 
detailed mental map of all-natural features — land, forests, rivers, 
but not settlements — within range. Settlements may be alluded 
to  —  areas  of  clear  terrain,  or  dug  trenches,  for  example.  Each 
time  you  increase  the  range  with  SL  increases  the  time  taken 
communing with the land by +1 minute.

•	 A dry or polluted well becomes clean and fresh 
•	 A planted field, vineyard or orchard bursts into life, with all 

crops immediately reaching full ripeness

•	 A sick or unproductive animal becomes healthy. The 

affected beast is now healthily productive (cows produce 
milk, hens lay eggs, coats and hides of sheep and cows are 
healthy and lustrous) and any diseases are cured.

Regenerate
CN: 6
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Your target gains the Regenerate Creature Trait (see page 341).

The loRe of lighT
Arcane  Spells  sung  from  the  Lore  of  Light  tend 
to  emit  dazzling  rays  of  blinding  white  light,  or 
shroud the caster in shimmering waves of radiant 
purity. You may inflict one Blinded Condition on those targeted 
by  Lore  of  Light  spells,  unless  they  possess  the Arcane Magic 
(Light) Talent. 

If  a  target  has  the  Daemonic  or  Undead  Creature  Traits, 
spells also inflict an additional hit with Damage equal to your 
Intelligence Bonus that ignores Toughness Bonus and Armour 
Points. 

Ingredients:  Hierophants  of  the  Lore  of  Light  use  many 
artefacts associated with holiness and holy places, supplemented 
by crystals, glass, pyramidions, and small statues, all carved with 
sacred symbols, twisting snakes, and moral tales. White candles, 
silver carvings, and bleached paper are also common.

Banishment

Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Instant

creatures  within  the  Area  of  Effect  whose  Toughness  is  lower 
than  your Willpower. Targets  with  the Undead  and Daemonic

Wounds. 

Clarity of Thought

Target: 1
Duration: Intelligence minutes
You  calm  your  target’s  mind,  allowing  them  to  think  clearly.

— are ignored while the spell is in effect. 

Daemonbane
CN: 10
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
You  summon  a  blast  of Hysh  that  passes  through  the  border 
between the Realm of Chaos and the material world. The Casting 
Test is Opposed by the target making a Willpower Test. If you 
win,  you  obliterate  a  target  with  the Daemonic  Creature Trait 
with a blinding white light, sending it back whence it came. If 
the  spell  successfully  banishes  a  Daemon,  everyone  looking  at 
your target, unless they possess the Arcane Magic (Light) Talent, 
receives +SL Blinded Conditions.

Healing Light
CN: 9
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Instant
Your target glows with a bright, cleansing light (equivalent light

Duration: Target’s Intelligence Bonus Rounds
You  cast  a  delicate  net  woven  from  strands  of Hysh  over  your 
targets,  whose  minds  are  overcome  with  conundrums  and 
puzzles, leaving them paralysed with indecision. Targets gain +1 
Stunned Condition, which they cannot lose while the spell is in 
effect.  When  recovering  from  the  Condition,  targets  test  their 
Intelligence  instead  of  the  Endurance  Skill.  Targets  with  the 
Bestial Creature Trait are immune to this spell.

You  summon  a  protective  aura  of  pure,  holy  light.  Profane 
creatures — those with the Undead or Daemonic Creature Trait, 
those with mutations, and those with more Corruption than their 
Willpower  Bonus  and  Toughness  Bonus  combined  —  cannot 
enter the Area of Effect. Any already within the Area gain the 
Broken  Condition  until  they  leave.  Creatures  within  the  Area 
cannot gain any Corruption points while the spell is active. 

Speed of Thought
CN: 8
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
A  lattice  of Hysh  overlays  your  mind,  allowing  you  to  think 
rapidly. Gain a bonus of +20 to Intelligence and Initiative.

The loRe of shadows
Spells  cast  from  the  Lore  of  Shadows  are 
surreptitious and sly, and so the lingua praestantia 
may  be  muttered  stealthily.  Any  protective  spells 
you may cast wreath you in shadows and billow smoke, making 
your  body  insubstantial,  possibly  even  allowing  blades  to  pass 
through you seemingly without harm. Further, all spells cast from 
the Lore of Shadows inflicting Damage ignore all non-magical 
Armour Points. 

Ingredients:  Anything  used  to  hide,  shroud,  or  conceal  is 
repurposed  as  Grey  ingredients,  including  cosmetics,  scents, 
scarfs, spectacles, mirrors, and wigs. Items drawn from professions 
steeped in intrigue and wisdom are also common, with diplomatic 
artefacts, symbols of rank, and the ultimate expression of power 
— a blade — prevalent.

Choking Shadows
CN: 6
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  wrap  shadowy  tendrils  of  Ulgu  around  your  foes’  necks. 
Assuming they need to breathe, they gain +1 Fatigued Condition, 
cannot talk, and are subject to rules for Suffocation (see page 181).

automatically  fool  anyone  without  the  Second Sight  Talent, 
though some may note if any of your mannerisms are incorrect. 
Those  with  that Talent  must  pass  a  Difficult (–10) Perception 
Test  to  notice  you  are  disguising  your  form. This  does  not  let 
them see through the spell. They must dispel it to do so. 

Illusion
CN: 8
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Initiative Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower minutes
You  spin  a  web  of  intricate  strands  of Ulgu,  obfuscating  the 
Area of Effect with an illusory image of your choosing. You will 
automatically  fool  anyone  without  the  Second Sight  Talent. 
Those  with  that Talent  must  pass  a  Difficult (–10) Perception 
Test to notice the illusion. This does not let them see through the 
spell. They must dispel it to do so. 

The illusion is, by default, static. For your Action, you may make 
a  Hard (–20) Channelling Test  to  make  the  illusion  move  for 
that Round. 

Mindslip
CN: 6
Range: 1 yard
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower minutes
You  conjure  delicate  threads  of Ulgu  in  your  Target’s  mind, 
causing  all  prior  memory  of  you  to  disappear  for  the  spell’s 
duration. Once the spell is over, the Target must pass an Average 
(+20) Intelligence Test, or the memory loss becomes permanent 
until dispelled.

Mystifying Miasma
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  conjure  forth  a  swirling  mass  of  mist  shot  through  with 
roiling shadow that flits and confounds the senses. Anyone within 
the  mist  who  does  not  possess  the Arcane Magic (Shadows) 
Talent is affected by the Miasma, gaining +1 Blinded, Deafened, 
and Fatigued  Condition,  which  remain  for  the  spell’s  duration. 
Anyone affected attempting to move must pass a  Challenging 
(+0) Perception Test, or gain the Prone Condition. If the spell 
is dispelled once in play, anyone affected by the spell must make 
a Routine (+40) Initiative Test, or gain the Stunned Condition. 

Doppelganger
CN: 10
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Intelligence Bonus minutes
You weave a mask and cloak of Ulgu around your form, assuming 
the  likeness  of  another  humanoid  creature  with  whom  you 
are  familiar  (as  determined  by  the  GM).  Your  appearance  will 

Shadowsteed
CN: 6
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: 1
Duration: Until the next sunrise
You  summon  forth  a  shadowy  steed.  The  creature’s  unnatural 
flesh  is  black  as  midnight,  and  at  times  it  appears  to  be  both 
solid  and  insubstantial.  Use  the  rules  for  a  riding  horse. When 

253

the  Shadowsteed  is  out  of  sunlight,  it  also  gains  the  following 
Creature  Traits:  Dark  Vision,  Ethereal,  Magical,  Painless, 
Stealthy, Stride, Fear (1) and Ward (+9).

1  +  SL  ingredients  on  a  successful  foraging  roll,  using  Lore 
(Herbalism), as described under Gathering Food and Herbs on 
page 127, or you can buy them for 5 brass pennies each.

Even  when  insubstantial,  Shadowsteeds  may  be  ridden.  Riders 
with the Arcane Magic (Shadow) Talent do so with a bonus of 
+20 to Ride Tests. Those without suffer a penalty of –20 to Ride 
Tests.  Shadowsteeds  are  tireless,  so  need  no  rest  (though  their 
unsettled  riders  might!).  As  the  first  rays  of  dawn  break  over 
the horizon the steeds melt into insubstantial mist. If still being 
ridden when the spell ends, or when dispelled, the rider will suffer 
Falling Damage (see page 166).

Shadowstep
CN: 8
Range: Willpower yards
Target: You
Duration: Instant
You  create  a  shadowy  portal  of Ulgu  through  the  aethyr.  You 
disappear  from  your  current  location  and  immediately  appear 
up  to  your  Willpower  yards  away.  Any  enemies  Engaged  by 
you  on  your  disappearance  or  reappearance  gain  the Surprised 
Condition.

Shroud of Invisibility
CN: 8
Range: Touch
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  wrap  the  target  in  a  shroud  of Ulgu. The Target  becomes 
invisible and cannot be perceived by mundane senses. The spell 
will automatically fool anyone without the Second Sight Talent. 
Those with the Talent must pass a Challenging (+0) Perception 
Test to notice that someone is nearby, though they will not be able 
to pin down the precise location. They must dispel the Shroud of 
Invisibility to do so . You are still perceptible to the other senses, 
and the spell will come to an end if you bring attention to yourself 
by making large noises or attacking someone.

Witch mAgic

The following provides two lists of six spells for spellcasters nor 
yet absorbed into the Colleges of Magic, who are almost always 
on the run from Witch Hunters and Sigmarites.

The loRe of hedgeCRafT
The  Hedgefolk  believe  their  Lore  is  a  gift  from  the  Gods, 
referring  to  their  spellcasters  as  the  Blessed  Few.  Due  to  their 
ancient  traditions  and  ingrained  belief,  their  spells  cannot  be 
cast  without  ingredients,  which  are  an  integral  part  of  their 
spellcasting process. 

Fortunately,  the  ingredients  they  use  are  easily  found  on  the 
fringes of settlements and are usually herbs or plants. You receive 

Ingredients:  Hedgefolk  use  easily  sourced  local  materials 
prepared to exacting standards using special tools. So, ingredients 
may include things such as the wings of a dragonfly killed with a 
silver pin, rods of poplar polished with beeswax on Sonnstill, or 
bones buried beneath a hedgerow for a winter’s month.

Goodwill 
CN: 0
Range: You
Target: AoE (Fellowship Bonus yards)
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  create  an  atmosphere  conducive  to  friendliness  and  good 
spirits. All Fellowship Tests within the Area of Effect receive a 
bonus of +10, and Animosity and Hatred Psychologies have no 
effect. 

Mirkride 
CN: 0
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Willpower Bonus minutes
Speaking  ancient  words  of  magic,  your  spirit  leaves  your  body, 
stepping  into  the  Hedge,  the  dark  space  between  the  material 
world  and  the  spirit  realm.  For  the  duration,  your  stand  apart 
from the world, able to witness it invisibly, but not affect it in any 
way.  Physical  barriers  are  no  impediment  to  you,  and  you  may 
walk through non-magical obstacles at will. Your body remains 
in place, immobile and insensate. 

At the end of the spell you will be pulled suddenly back to your 
body. If your body is killed while you are walking the Hedge, your 
spirit will wander aimlessly for eternity. 

Nepenthe 
CN: 0
Range: Touch
Target: Special
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  mutter  words  of  power  over  a  premade  potion  of  herbs, 
magically transforming it into a potent philtre. If drunk while the 
spell is in effect, the target may choose to completely forget one 
individual, permanently. 

Nostrum 
CN: 0
Range: Touch
Target: Special
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  incant  a  spell  over  an  already  prepared  draught,  imbuing  it 
with magical power. If drunk while the spell is in effect, the target 
immediately heals your Willpower Bonus in Wounds and is cured 
of one disease. For every +2 SL you may cure an extra disease. 

254

m aG I c

VIII

Part the Branches 
CN: 0
Range: You
Target: You
Duration: Willpower minutes
Your  pupils  dilate  as  you  complete  your  incantation,  and  you 
are able to see into the Spirit world. This allows you to perceive 
invisible  creatures,  spirits,  and  Daemons,  even  those  marked  as 
impossible to see.

Protective Charm
CN: 0
Range: Touch
Target: Special
Duration: Willpower Bonus days
You imbue a protective charm with a spell of protection. Those 
bearing  the  charm  gain  the Magic Resistance  Talent.  If  they 
already have that Talent, the charm does nothing more.

The loRe of wiTChCRafT
Spells  from  the  Lore  of  Witchcraft  draw  on  whichever  winds 
of magic are available, without care or concern for mingling the 
winds and the potentially horrific results. Each time practitioners 
of Witchcraft roll on a Miscast table, they also gain 1 Corruption 
point. Further, you may inflict one Bleeding Condition on anyone 
targeted by spells from the Lore of Witchcraft. Lastly, channelling 
or  casting  spells  from  this  Lore  automatically  require  a  roll  on 
the Minor Miscast table unless cast with an ingredient , where 
the  ingredient  provides  no  further  protection  should  you  roll  a 
Miscast. Fortunately, ingredients for the Lore of Witchcraft are 
cheap and readily available: body parts of small animals for the 
most part. Ingredients cost a spell’s CN in brass pennies, instead 
of silver shillings, to purchase. Alternatively, a Witch may forage 
for parts, using the Outdoor Survival skill: a successful foraging 
roll  receives  1  +  SL  ingredients,  as  described  under  Gathering 
Food and Herbs on page 127.

Ingredients: Witches use a horrific mixture of animal body parts, 
often harvested when a creature is still alive. It is not uncommon to 
find them clutching lizard eyes, dog toes, donkey gizzard, or much, 
much worse in their bloody hands as they cast their foul magics.

Blight
CN: 14
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: Special
Duration: Special
You may target either a well, a field, or a domestic animal. If you 
successfully cast the spell, the target suffers from a blight:

•	 A blighted well becomes instantly brackish and stagnant
•	 Any crops currently planted in a Blighted field rot overnight
•	 A blighted animal sickens. The afflicted beast no longer 

produces anything (cows produce no milk, hens produce no 
eggs, coats and hides grow mangy and unusable) and will 
die in 10–SL days

Creeping Menace
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You summon a swarm of creeping, slithering creatures to harass 
your foes. Each target affected is immediately engaged by a swarm 
of Giant Rats, Giant Spiders, or Snakes. Use the standard profiles 
for the relevant creature type, adding the Swarm Trait. For your 
Action you may make a Challenging (+0) Charm Animal Test 
to direct 1 or more swarms to attack a different target. 

When the spell ends, any remaining swarms disappear into the 
shadows. 

Curse of Crippling Pain
CN: 10
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Stabbing a crude representation of your target — a doll or puppet 
—  you  inflict  crippling  pain.  When  successfully  cast,  choose 
which hit location to stab:

•	 Leg – Leg becomes useless, as if it was Amputated (see 
page 180). If running, the target also gains the Prone 
Condition and takes falling Damage.

•	 Arm – Arm becomes useless, as if it was Amputated (see 

page 180). If target was holding anything in that hand, it is 
automatically dropped. 

•	 Body – Target doubles up in agony, gaining +1 Fatigued 

Condition, and must pass a Hard (–20) Endurance Test or 
gain the Prone Condition.

•	 Head – Target gains the Stunned Condition, and must 
pass an Average (+20) Endurance Test or gain the 
Unconscious Condition for the Duration.

While  the  spell  is  in  effect,  for  your  Action  you  may  make  a 
Channelling Test,  stabbing  the  doll  again,  to  affect  a  different 
location.

Curse of Ill-Fortune
CN: 8
Range: Willpower Bonus miles
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus days
The ingredient for this spell is something belonging to the target, 
either a personal possession or a strand of hair. For the duration, 
your target suffers bad luck. Laces snap, chairs break, and other 
minor narrative effects inconvenience them. The target suffers a 
penalty of –10 to all Tests, in addition to any other modifiers, and 
may not spend Fortune points.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Haunting Horror
CN: 8
Range: Touch
Target: AoE (a single location)
Duration: Willpower days
You  target  a  single  location,  such  as  a  house  or  clearing,  and 
inflict haunting dreams and waking nightmares on any who enter 
there. Those entering while the spell is in effect are unnerved by 
eerie  sensations,  flitting  shadows,  and  whispered  voices  lurking 
on  the  threshold  of  hearing.  Unless  they  possess  the Arcane 
Magic (Witchcraft)  Talent,  they  gain  +1 Fatigued  Condition. 
Then, unless they pass an Challenging (+0) Cool Test, they gain 
another +1 Fatigued Condition and the Broken Condition, both 
of which are only removed upon leaving the location.

The Evil Eye
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
You lock eyes with a single target, who must be looking at you. 
Perform an Opposed Intimidate/Cool Test, adding any SL from 
your casting roll to your result. Your opponent gains 1 Fatigued 
Condition per +2 SL by which you win. If you win by 6+ SL, your 
opponent gains the Broken Condition.

dARk mAgic

The following provides two short lists of four Dark Magic spells.

loRe of daemonology
The  forbidden  Lore  of  Daemonology 
is  concerned  with 
summoning,  binding,  and  controlling  Daemons,  typically  to 
empower the spellcaster. It is horrifically dangerous, usually leading 
to  the  Daemonologist’s  downfall  as  their  soul  is  taken  by  the 
Ruinous Powers and a new Chaos Sorcerer is born.

Destroy Lesser Daemon
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Your spell disrupts the Dhar holding a target Daemon together, 
and draws it back to you. A target with the Daemonic Creature 
Trait  and  a  lower  Willpower  than  you  loses  Wounds  equal  to 
your  Willpower  Bonus,  ignoring Toughness  Bonus  or  Armour 
Points. In turn, you may increase one of your Characteristic by 
+10 for the duration as you siphon profane energies.

Detect Daemon
CN: 4
Range: Willpower yards
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
Your  spell  homes  in  on  the  daemonic  influences  in  the 
surrounding area. You automatically know if there is a manifested 

Daemon within range, be it summoned, bound into an artefact, 
possessing another, or similar.

Manifest Lesser Daemon
CN: 8
Range: Willpower Bonus yards
Target: Special
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You channel a sickening flow of Dhar, briefly forcing a rent into 
the  fabric  of  reality.  A  Lesser  Daemon  immediately  manifests 
through  the  rent  (see  page  335  for  two  examples  of  this:  a 
Bloodletter  or  a  Daemonette).  Perform  an  Opposed  Channel 
(Dhar)/Willpower  Test  with  the  Daemon.  If  successful,  the 
Daemon  will  respond  to  one  command  issued  by  you,  quite 
literally, then vanish (assuming the command is completed before 
the Duration ends). If failed, the Daemon immediately attacks.

Octagram
CN: 10
Range: Touch
Target: AoE (maximum, Willpower Bonus yards across)
Duration: Willpower minutes
Daubing an octagram to the floor, and marking it with unholy 
symbols,  you  ward  against  all  daemonic  influence.  Those  with 
the Daemonic Creature Trait cannot enter or leave the octagram 
unless their Willpower is more than twice yours. 

loRe of neCRomanCy
Necromancy is an ancient and bloody magic art concerned with 
mastering  death  and  seeking  immortality,  often  by  carving  up 
rotting corpses. Considered one of the foulest and most heretical 
of  magics,  few  take  to  studying  its  fell  secrets  lightly,  for  the 
horrors of the dead, and the undead, cannot be underestimated.

Raise Dead
CN: 8
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Until sunrise
You  channel  a  heavy  flow  of Dhar  into  bare  earth,  causing  old 
bones to gather and rise. SL+1 Skeletons will claw upwards into 
the affected area at the end of the Round, which are organised 
as you prefer within the area of effect. They start with the Prone 
Condition.  The  summoned  undead  are  entirely  under  your 
control and can perform simple orders as you command. If you 
are killed or gain an Unconscious Condition, the spell comes to 
an end and the summoned Undead collapse. For each +2 SL you 
score, you may summon an extra SL Skeletons.

Reanimate
CN: 8
Range: Willpower yards
Target: AoE (Willpower Bonus yards)
Duration: Until sunrise
You channel worming strands of thick Dhar before you, sinking 
it into corpses, reanimating that which was once dead. Reanimate 
Willpower  Bonus  +  SL  dead  bodies  (as  Zombies)  or  skeletons

attack  as  if  you  had  spent  2  Advantage  to  activate  the Breath 
Creature Trait (see page 338). It counts as a magic missile with a 
Damage equal to your Toughness Bonus, and it ignores Armour 
Points. The attack also has the Corrosive and Poison Traits listed 
under  the Breath  Creature  Trait.  Further,  should  any  targets 
take  more  than  their Toughness  Bonus  in  Wounds,  they  must 
pass a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test or contract Blood Rot 
(see page 186). For every +2 SL achieved, you may also increase 
Damage by +2. 

loRe of slaanesh
The Lore of Slaanesh brings torture and excess, all splayed before 
the Prince of Pain and Pleasure for its eternal enjoyment, typically 
pressuring a perverse mix of the Amethyst, Gold, and Jade Winds 
into something twisted and exotic.

Acquiescence
CN: 5
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Your magic pierces deep within your target, flooding the soul with 
an acute awareness of their broken dreams. The target’s Initiative 
Characteristic drops to 10, if it was not already lower, as the mind 
turns inwards. On the target’s Turn, all movement is randomised 
as determined by the GM as the character bemoans life, lewdly 
telling  all  what  should  have  been  as  hands  are  flung  in  the  air. 
Further, the target can only perform an Action if a Challenging 
(+0) Cool Test is first passed; if failed, the Target is far too busy 
bemoaning what could have been to do anything else.

loRe of TzeenTCh
Tzeentch is the Master of Magic, Treachery, and Lies. The Lore 
of Tzeentch epitomises this, as it boasts a multitude of powerful 
spells focussing upon change, all drawing heavily from the Grey, 
Amethyst, and Bright Winds.

Treason of Tzeentch
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You  channel  fine  strands  of  traitorous  mergings  of  the  Winds 
of Magic directly into your target’s mind, twisting motivations, 
undermining desires, and fanning fires of discontent. The target 
can  no  longer  use  Talents,  and  doesn’t  add  Skill  Advances 
when making Skill Tests, meaning the target only Tests against 
unmodified Characteristics.

(as Skeletons) within range. They start with the Prone Condition. 
The  summoned  Undead  are  entirely  under  your  control  and 
can perform simple orders as you command. If you die or gain 
an Unconscious  Condition,  the  spell  comes  to  an  end  and  the 
reanimated  corpses  fall  dead  again.  For  each  +2  SL  you  score, 
you may reanimate an extra Willpower Bonus +SL Skeletons or 
Zombies.

Screaming Skull
CN: 8
Range: Willpower yards
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
You shriek the high-pitched words of the spell and a large, black 
skull wreathed with greenish-purple fire forms before you, then 
flies forwards, screaming and cackling as it goes. The skull moves 
in a straight line for the spell range, following the contours of the 
land, passing through any obstacles in its way. Screaming Skull 
is a magic missile that only affects targets without the Undead 
Creature Trait, and has a Damage equal to your Willpower Bonus. 
Any suffering Wounds from the spell must pass a Challenging 
(+0) Cool Test or also take a Broken Condition.

Vanhel’s Call
CN: 6
Range: Willpower yards
Target: Special
Duration: Instant
You  manipulate  complicated  flows  of Dhar  into  your  targets, 
filling  them  with  overwhelming  energy.  Intelligence  Bonus 
targets with the Undead Trait gain a free Move or Action — you 
choose one or the other to affect all targets — this is taken the 
moment  the  spell  is  cast.  For  each  +2  SL  you  score,  you  may 
invigorate an extra Intelligence Bonus targets.

chAoS mAgic

Three of the four Great Powers of Chaos have a unique Lore of 
Magic — only Khorne, the Blood God, who abhors treacherous 
magic and all it stands for, has no Lore of his own. One spell is 
provided here for each of the primary Chaos Lores, which can be 
added to provide flavour to your Chaos Cultists in addition to the 
Arcane Spells and the Lore of Daemonology. 

loRe of nURgle
The Lore of Nurgle spreads foul disease and filth, mixing bloated 
excesses  of  the  Jade  Wind  with  whatever  corruption  comes  to 
hand, then spewing it everywhere.

Stream of Corruption
CN: 9
Range: Special

the Gamemaster

•

Being the Gamemaster (GM) is the best thing ever. While the 
Players  are  busy  with  their  single,  measly  Character,  you’re  in 
charge of the entire world! If you’re a new GM this can be a little 
daunting, but don’t worry, you’ll get the hang of it quickly, and 
we’ll walk you through the basics here. 

The most important responsibility of a GM is to make sure everyone 
has  fun,  including  you.  You’ll  be  juggling  roles  of  storyteller, 
umpire, and host, but don’t lose sight of the fact that the reason 
everyone is playing the game is to have a good time. Balance your 
storytelling  with  allowing  Players  spotlight  time  and  autonomy 
in  their  actions.  If  a  scene  isn’t  working,  wrap  it  up  quickly  and 
move on. Balance the game rules with everyone’s enjoyment of the 
game — if something seems counter-intuitive or is taking too long, 
change it. Always focus on what your group finds fun.

You are the world. Everything  the  Players  interact  with  comes 
from you. You provide the world they explore. Your descriptions 
tell them what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. You’ll play 
the role of the people and creatures with which they interact. You 
describe  the  outcome  of  every  action  they  take  and  determine 
how the game rules are applied. 

so you can find what you need. Choose quickly if you are going to 
resolve an action with a GM decision or if you want the Player to 
make a Test. This choice will partly be a matter of personal style 
— do you and your Players like relying on the Character sheets 
to define what happens or do you prefer to save dice rolls for only 
the most important situations? Correctly and openly interpreting 
the results of Tests demonstrates to your Players that their actions 
have consequences, and that you are consistent and fair in your 
application of the rules.

You  are  the  plot.  Before  the  game  you’ll  prepare  the  adventure, 
making  sure  you  know  what  events  are  planned  to  take  place, 
and who is involved in them. It is generally a good idea to have 
some  contingency  plans  in  place  should  the  Players  leap  to  the 
wrong conclusions and go off at a tangent (they will do this more 
often  than  you  might  think!).  Make  sure  you  have  all  the  game 
information for the main characters in the adventure, along with 
anyone or anything the Characters might have to fight. Be familiar 
with the adventure’s background and the area it takes place in, and 
you will be able to improvise effectively. You can also prepare some 
stock events to use in case improvisation is required.

You  are  the  rules.  Make  sure  you  understand  the  rules  so  the 
game runs smoothly and quickly. Be familiar with the rulebook 

You  are  the  leader.  Encourage  good  playing  by  making  sure 
that  everyone  has  a  chance  to  participate,  and  that  the  game 
runs smoothly. Remind Players that rules discussions take place

outside  the  game,  and  that  you  need  to  be  able  to  get  on  with 
running the game to achieve maximum fun! Be thoughtful and 
respectful  of  your  Players.  Be  aware  of  content  that  might  be 
uncomfortable  for  some  people,  for  instance  graphic  violence, 
sex, or horror. Check it’s okay before those subjects come up in a 
game. Justify your authority by being fair to everyone, consistent 
in how you apply the rules, and running the best Sigmar-blessed 
game this side of the Worlds Edge Mountains.

•	 Make a list of descriptive phrases appropriate for 

the locations the adventure is taking place in, to help 
improvised scenes.

•	

If in doubt, err on the side of having fun.

•	 Give Characters challenges that require improvisation or 

creative thinking.

geneRal adviCe
There’s  a  lot  of  advice  on  running  games  out  there.  It’s  a  huge 
subject and requires much more space than we have here, so we’re 
adding a lot of advice to the Cubicle 7 website – keep checking 
back as we plan to keep building up that section. The rest of this 
chapter provides some specific advice for what to do at different 
stages of a game. 

•	

You can’t detail everyone the Characters meet, but a single 
feature — an accent, catchphrase or tic — helps make 
everyone memorable!

Rules Notes
As  you  play  more  games  of  WFRP,  the  rules  will  become 
increasingly  familiar. To  give  you  a  head  start,  these  points  are 
worth initially bearing in mind:

As  a  starter  —  or  refresher  for  experienced  GMs  —  here’s  a 
condensed list of things to think about: 

•	 Tests: Use of the different methods of resolving actions (see 
page 150) give you considerable control over the pace of the 
game — use them!

•	 Get to know this book well.

•	 Give the players what they want from the game without 

ruining your own plans.

•	 Make sure new groups of Characters have reasons to be 

adventuring together.

•	 Consider how to handle or bypass content a player might 

not find to their taste.

•	

•	

•	

Bookmark sections you will be returning to often, such as 
Chapter 8: Magic if one of your players is a wizard.

Be aware of plot devices and how to use them to good 
effect.

Ensure the challenges you set your Players are achievable, 
and that any enemies that need to be defeated can be 
defeated.

•	

Intersperse some light relief into horror-heavy games.

•	 Decide which parts of the adventure should be easy and 
quickly resolved, and which should be the most dramatic 
and challenging.

•	 What parts of the adventure need to be successful to make 

the story satisfying, and how will you ensure they happen 
without making your players feel too railroaded?

•	 When it comes to the results of Tests, be firm but fair.

•	

Be ready to make a big deal of players using or gaining Fate 
and Resilience points.

•	

•	

Fortune  Points:  Encourage  your  players  to  spend  these 
during play or you will find cautious players repeatedly have 
several at the end of the session unused, and have probably 
failed some Tests they could have passed.

Advantage:  Advantage  speeds  up  combat  by  adding 
momentum  for  winning  each  round.  Remember  all 
Advantage is lost when you lose a round, or if you are hit by 
ranged or magical attacks — Advantage is not as scary as it 
first appears, even if it stacks high. Should Characters become 
overwhelmed, they may wish to consider disengaging, then 
either  fleeing  or  attacking  from  afar.  Characters  can  also 
spend  Resilience  points  to  automatically  win  a  round  and 
eliminate any build-up of Advantage their foes might have 
secured.

•	 Opposed  Tests:  Almost  all  combat  Tests  are  Opposed, 
meaning that someone always wins, even if both combatants 
effectively  fail  their  individual  Tests.  Remember,  the 
difference  in  SL  will  always  secure  a  winner.  This  means 
even very poor combatants will be landing blows right from 
the outset — just without any skill or finesse.

•	 No Opposition: Should you find opponents who refuse to 
defend themselves for fear of rolling poorly in an Opposed 
Test,  then  clearly  their  Characters  are  doing  nothing, 
meaning they count as Helpless (see page 162).

ChaRaCTeR CReaTion
Before  your  first WFRP  game  begins,  the  Players  will  need  to 
create  Characters,  or  choose  one  of  the  ready-made  characters 
provided  on  the  Cubicle  7  website  or  the  WFRP  Starter  Set. 
The ready-made Characters are already formed into a group and 

259

IX

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

are  ready  to  go,  but  if  your  Players  are  creating  their  own,  you 
should guide them through the process.

Character Creation can take a while, so it can be worth devoting 
the first game session to it, so let the Players know this in advance 
to manage their expectations. You can take Players through each 
step of character creation, but Players having their own rulebooks 
can  speed  things  up  considerably.  Guide  new  Players  through 
how  the  different  parts  of  their  Character  will  be  used  in  the 
game, and encourage Players to coordinate their choices so they 
can build a broadly capable group. A good spread of Classes gives 
both you and the Players more options during play. If the group 
has  no  spellcasters  for  example,  you  can’t  run  adventures  that 
require the Players follow magical clues. 

Encourage  Players  to  involve  other  Characters  in  their  own 
Character’s  background  and  provide  suggestions  to  help.  This 
helps bind the group together and should make it easier for them 
to choose a Group Ambition. Avoid creating a group of disparate 
desperadoes  who  won’t  work  together  and  never  cooperate  on 
anything. That gets old fast and can lead to unsatisfying gaming 
experiences. 

The group should have a reason to stick together, work together, 
and be motivated to engage with the adventures awaiting them. 
A good way to make sure the group has this is to simply ask your 
Players  to  explain  exactly  why  their  Characters  work  together, 
and  why  they  will  adventure  together  in  future.  You  may  be 
surprised at just how inventive your Players can be.

Having a good idea of the adventures you have planned means 
you  can  weave  connections  to  them  into  each  Character’s 
background. If you’ve got a smuggler in the group, and you know 
part  of  the  forthcoming  adventures  involve  a  smuggling  ring, 
work your smugglers into that Character’s background. If a Chaos 
Cult is central to the adventure, perhaps decide that an important 
member of one Character’s family will be a secret member of the 
cult. These personal details will make for a more involving game 
that really immerses the Players in the game world. 

If  your  group  are  not  cooperating,  you  can  always  try  external 
motivations. For example: the promise of an incredible reward the 
Characters can’t resist, or being ‘asked’ to do work by a powerful 
patron who won’t take refusal kindly.

The Character creation phase is also a great place to discuss the 
kind  of  game  everyone  wants  to  play.  Identifying  content  to 
avoid  —  for  instance  graphic  violence,  sex,  or  horror  —  is  just 
as  important  as  determining  the  game  your  Players  will  enjoy. 
Some  people  might  not  be  comfortable  talking  about  this  in 
front  of  others,  so  make  sure  you  give  everyone  the  chance  to 
communicate  with  you  privately  about  it,  and  don’t  ask  for  the 
reasons why — the preference is enough. If in any doubt, err on 
the  side  of  caution,  and  remember  the  goal  is  for  everyone  to 
have fun.

aT The TaBle
During sessions where you are running games of WFRP as the 
GM, here’s what you’ll be doing:

1. Set the scene
At the start of the game, the GM should give a summary of what 
has happened in the adventure so far — in the first session of an 
adventure this will instead be some background to the adventure 
about to begin. It’s the recap part of a TV series: ‘Previously on 
WFRP…’: keep it short and sweet.

Next,  you’ll  describe  where  the  Characters  are  and  what  is 
happening  around  them.  Provide  immediate  prompts  to  action 
— make sure that the game gets off to an exciting start. End with 
an event or question that means the Players have to get involved 
right away — even a simple knock on their door, or thrown jar of 
ale arcing gently across the taproom towards them immediately 
leads to action!

2. Listen to the Players
The  Players  will  react  to  the  scene-setting  and  will  interpret 
what is going on, often in a way that us GMs would describe as 
‘interesting’. As GM, you already know the plot of the adventure, 
but the Players will need to puzzle it out, perhaps with a false start 
or two. Don’t panic if they head off in the wrong direction — they’ll 
get there in the end, and you’ll have a lot of fun along the way. 

So, resolve their immediate actions in the game while listening 
carefully to how they are going to react to the wider plot to give 

260

t h e   G a m e m a s t e r

IX

you thinking time for the next part. Make sure each Player has 
the  opportunity  to  contribute  —  actively  ask  any  Player  who 
hasn’t yet participated what their Character is going to do.

3. Describe the consequences of the Players’ 
actions
You’ll  react  to  the  Player’s  actions  depending  on  what  they  are 
doing. If they are talking to one of the character’s you’ve described 
as being present in the scene, you’ll respond to them in the role of 
that person. If they are taking actions that require Tests to resolve, 
you’ll  decide  which  Skill  is  being  tested,  any  modifiers  on  the 
Test, and interpret the outcome — what happens because of that 
action. Sometimes this will be the start of a sequence of events, 
which other Players might join, or it may be a simple action that 
is quickly resolved. Again, make sure everyone has an opportunity 
to do something and contribute to the game. Ask quieter Players 
directly to make sure they get a go.

This Player-directed phase of the game can go on for quite some 
time, as you all take turns to move the story forward, and the GM 
is largely in a reactive role. Even experienced GMs can be amazed 
at  the  tangents  Players  can  pursue,  and  some  very  memorable 
games come from this improvised style of play.

4. Describe events from the ongoing plot
While the Player-directed phase is going on, the GM will be aware 
of the adventure plot circling in the Aethyr. At the appropriate 
times, events from the plot will come crashing in. The Players will 
now be reacting to events before formulating their new plan and 
pursuing  it  in  their  inevitably  haphazard  style. These  moments 
can be used as course-corrections, giving additional clues on what 
is really happening, and helping get Players back on track. 

Be  careful  not  to  be  too  blunt  or  obvious  with  these  events 
however — no-one likes to feel like they are being forced towards 
an  inevitable  conclusion.  Allow  Players  the  autonomy  to  really 
mess things up, but also don’t be afraid to modify your plot on the 
hoof if it makes for a more enjoyable game. 

TRavel
Travelling in the Old World can be dangerous. Brigands, mutants, 
and beasts lurk in the shadows, an ever-present threat, perhaps 
joined  by  those  specifically  out  to  thwart  the  Players’  actions. 
Some parts of the Empire have been corrupted by magic, Chaos, 
Necromancy,  or  worse,  and  can  easily  consume  the  unwary 
traveller. Even the weather poses a threat!

It’s up to you how you want to represent the dangers of travel in your game. Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of how long the journey was, and the key points along the way. Most journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more dangerous, and cheaper, option.Travel by RoadThe roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable. The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.Travel by RiverRiver journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.Travel PricesThe prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they’re doing.High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more. Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of the Empire, like the famous Emperor Luitpold plying the River Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim.Travel CosTsall the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose guides only. Faster coaches and barges generally cost twice as much. slower examples cost as little as half as much. Increase or decrease speed by +/– 1 for faster or slower examples. TransportMovementCostDistanceCOACH6Inside–/2per mileOutside–/1per mileBARGE8Cabin–/5per mileDeck–/2per mileCAB6–/3per districtFERRY4–/1per 20 yardsTravel TimesUse Movement to determine travel speed in miles per hour. So, if a party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately 3 miles per hour. Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day without requiring Endurance Tests. If travelling faster or farther, give a Fatigue Condition to those failing this Test, with extra Fatigue if Encumbered (see page 293).Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate.Travel EventsWhether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel events. It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure. An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly defined ‘goodies vs. baddies’ Beastmen attack. A tense, bleak session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp with a travelling circus. Further, you can work these encounters into your ongoing narrative if you wish. Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal. Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or reinforcing the themes of an adventure. t h e   G a m e m a s t e r

IX

It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events 
to  be  for  your  players.  Some  could  simply  consist  of  a  brief 
description, while others could form the basis of an entire session 
of  play.  Some  GMs  prefer  to  roll  1d10  per  day  of  travel  and 
have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed 
symbol  of  Chaos  —  something  unexpected  and  random  has 

occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or 
more. This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a 
printed adventure by Cubicle 7 that includes a journey, suggested 
events and travel times will be included. So, the following table 
can  be  used  as  you  prefer,  and  presumes  a  single  event  for  the 
journey travelled.

263

1d10Event1Restful Journey: The journey is blessedly uneventful, the Characters get good rest, the scenery is particularly inspiring, and perhaps they meet an NPC healer or helpful priest. The Characters can heal all Wounds and recover all Fatigued Conditions.2How Interesting!: A chance encounter on the road with other travellers, a particularly good inn or shrine, or an intriguing ancient ruin gives a wonderful story to share.3Now That’s Useful!: The Characters find out something relevant to their adventure — gossip, a lost message, a sight they weren’t meant to witness, or similar.4Tiring Journey!: The route is blocked. A bridge could be down, a river blocked or road flooded, or some other insurmountable obstacle. One Character makes a Average (+20) Outdoor Survival Test to find a good alternative route, otherwise everyone arrives a day late, with a Fatigued Condition.5Pursued!: An enemy picks up the Characters’ trail and has to be dealt with or put off the scent before they can reach their destination. If they don’t have an obvious enemy yet, look to the Characters’ backgrounds — there will be something in there somewhere. The confrontation could be violent unless they can talk their way out of it, and losing their tail could add days to their journey.6Thieves!: Somehow the Characters get robbed. Perhaps it was someone travelling with them, sharing their campfire for the night or just a brief conversation on the road. Do they stop to chase down their belongings or write it off as a risk of the adventurous life?7Not Them Again!: A rival or other source of annoyance plagues the Characters on their journey. Play this for laughs but make them genuinely annoying and a recurring minor bane of the Character’s lives. Never enough to fall to violence, but close. They could be a rival guild member obsessed with ‘winning’ over a member of the group, or a coach passenger with an especially irritating demeanour.8Bad Influence!: The Characters encounter someone who appears to help them but has sinister intentions. That bad-smelling guy who knows a shortcut through the Garden of Morr and insists you go first. The charming old aristocrat who invites you to stay for dinner in her ancestral home. The scruffy woman who knows where to find all the ‘best’ mushrooms. Have fun! 9Even Nature Hates You!: The Characters find themselves in danger from nature. Deadly animals, lightning storms, disease, insects, you name it. This could result in violence, or in them receiving a Condition, or in a small but vicious encounter when they choose the wrong shepherd’s hut as a shelter. 10Attacked!: The Characters are attacked on their journey. It could be an unlucky encounter relevant to the area they are travelling through (Beastmen in the deep forest, for instance) or something planned by their opponents (hired thugs to stop the Characters reaching their destination). If they fail a Routine (+20) Perception Test, they may even be ambushed! IX

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

You  might  like  to  give  Players  the  opportunity  to  avoid  nasty 
events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or 
whatever other Test makes sense at the time. If they are travelling 
in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help 
in overcoming any adversities. 

afTeR The game
Try  to  end  your  session  in  a  narratively  satisfying  way,  either 
with a moment of resolution, revelation, mystery, or the dreaded 
cliffhanger,  leaving  your  Players  waiting  until  the  next  session 
before learning what happens to their Characters.

Awarding XP 
At  the  end  of  every  session  you  should  award  your  players  XP. 
This is your opportunity to reward your Players for cooperation, 
good roleplaying and making the experience fun. Remember that 
it’s better to use the carrot than the stick — don’t punish players 
who didn’t cooperate, reward those who did. People will soon get 
the message! 

Additional bonuses of 25-50 XP could be awarded for excellent 
roleplaying, teamwork, or otherwise getting in the spirit of things. 
If you are playing a published adventure from Cubicle 7, it will 
list suggested XP awards for every session.

Recovering Fate and Resilience
A Player spending a point of Fate or Resilience is a significant 
event. Characters generally have few of these points, and they are 
powerful, so they should be spent wisely. After all, spending Fate 
or Resilience will also reduce the number of Fortune and Resolve 
points a character has available. 

Awarding  Players  Fate  and  Resilience  points  is  likewise  a  rare 
and special occurrence. The end of a long adventure or campaign 
of significant importance could be rewarded with a Fate point. 
Or a Character achieving something of extraordinary personal 
significance  could  be  awarded  a  Resilience  point.  If  you  are 
playing  printed  adventures  from  Cubicle  7,  obvious  points 
to  award  Fate  points,  and  sometimes  Resilience  points,  are 
included.

GlorIous reIKland

•

to his Imperial majesty, emperor Karl-Franz the First, by the Grace of the Gods, elector count and Grand prince of reikland, prince of 
altdorf, count of the West march, defender of sigmar’s Faith, do I commend this text, an examination of his most illustrious realm, the 
Grand Princedom of Reikland, heartland of Our Holy Empire. long may he rule!

herein learn of the mightiest province of the empire, and of its hard-working people who are united by the worship of the God-King sigmar. 
admire the elector counts of the reikland who have led the glorious empire for almost a century, and their generous patronage that enriches 
our homeland beyond measure. Wonder at the reikland’s impressive canal network, extensive roadworks, sophisticated farming, and its rapidly 
developing mercantile class, all of which confirm the Reikland as a true jewel of the Empire. 

marvel at this richest, most cosmopolitan of all imperial realms, and see that it is a cultural, magical, and academic powerhouse without 
par, attracting the most impressive artisans, wizards, and scholars to its many learned institutions, cementing its reputation as the greatest 
domain of the old World.

truly, to be born a reiklander is to be born blessed by the Gods themselves. Give thanks to sigmar and be praised.

– the words of holy mother halma habermann of sigmar
– recorded faithfully by the humble scribe melistius of the order of the anvil in 2510 Ic

Standing proud in the heart of the Old World, the Reikland is the richest and most powerful of the Empire’s grand provinces. 
Known  for  its  engineers,  wizards,  and  merchants,  and  for  being  the  birthplace  of  the  Cult  of  Sigmar,  it  is  a  realm  of  soaring 
mountains, snaking rivers, dark forests, and powerful trading centres. From his throne in the city of high-spired Altdorf, Emperor 
Karl-Franz I rules not only the Reikland, but all the Empire that lies beyond.

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

the lie oF the lAnd

The  Reikland  lies  in  the  shadow  of  the  forbidding  Grey 
Mountains, and its lowlands are entirely forested save for cleared 
regions  around  the  grand  province’s  multitude  of  prosperous 
towns  and  villages.  It  has  no  coastline,  but  the  Reik  —  the 
largest river in the Old World that defines most of the Reikland’s 
twisting eastern and northern borders — is so wide and deep an 
entire navy of warships and merchant vessels plies its length. 

Much of the land near the Reik is waterlogged and marshy, with 
long stretches of bogs, swamps, and dangerous  mud plains,  the 
largest  of  which  is  the  Grootscher  Marsh  on  the  border  with 
the Wasteland to the west. Farther inland, the Reikland climbs 
upwards to the craggy Skaag Hills and the haunted Hägercrybs, 
two forested uplands hiding isolated regions nigh-on untouched 
by human hand. The forests eventually give way as the land rises 
towards the Grey Mountains, the Reikland’s natural border with 
Bretonnia to the south, and opens up to a wide plain of fertile 
foothills and open grassland known as the Vorbergland.

The moUnTains, fooThills, 
and voRBeRgland
The  Reikland  is  a  rugged  realm,  its  undulating  forests  broken 
by  peaks,  crags,  and  ridges,  many  topped  by  ruined  castles  and 
watchtowers  from  previous,  war-torn  eras.  Rising  above  this 
multitude  of  minor  ranges  are  the  Hägercrybs  and  the  Skaag 
Hills,  two  highland  regions  in  central  and  northern  Reikland, 
their heavily fortified mines responsible for much of the realm’s 
recent prosperity. Farther south, the trees thin out to the exposed 
plains and foothills of the fertile Vorbergland that lie between the 
Reikwald forest and the dangerous Grey Mountains, peaks that 
offer enormous wealth and danger in equal measure.

The Grey Mountains
The  forbidding  peaks  of  the  Grey  Mountains  are  riddled  with 
crumbling tunnels and topped with ruined skybridges from the 
time  when  Dwarfs  ruled  the  region.  But  that  era  has  passed, 
and only a handful of determined clans remain to defend their 
ancestral  holds,  with  recently  reclaimed  Karak  Azgaraz  and 
towering Karak Ziflin being two of the largest still standing. 

The mountains and the tunnels beneath them are now overrun 
with  Orcs  and  Goblins,  Mountain  Trolls,  Skaven,  and  worse. 
While  this  makes  the  Grey  Mountains  especially  dangerous, 
many  claim  the  fallen  Dwarf  holds  hide  treasures  lost  to  time, 
so the foolhardy and desperate are drawn to the ancient halls like 
moths to a flame. Few survive their greed.

So high is the glacial spine of the Grey Mountains that it is all 
but  impassable,  forming  a  near  impenetrable  border  between 
the  Reikland  and  the  Bretonnian  duchies  to  the  south-east. 
Only  two  reliable  passes  pierce  the  frozen  heights:  the  well-
defended Axe-Bite Pass guarded by the fortresses of Helmgart 
and  Monfort,  and  the  winding  Grey  Lady  Pass  leading  from 
Ubersreik  to  Parravon.  Both  passes  are  heavily  patrolled  and 
taxed,  leading  some  impoverished  merchants  and  smugglers 
to hire mountain guides to lead them across lesser passes such 
as  the  Crooked  Corridor  or  Durak  Way,  an  undertaking  few 
would recommend.

The Hägercrybs 
Dominating  the  centre  of  the  Reikland,  the  mist-shrouded 
Hägercrybs extend from the Princedom of Altdorf in the north 
all the way to the Freiburg of Ubersreik in the south, and are so 
heavily forested that no road pierces through their heights from 
east to west, resulting in long journeys for those traveling from 
one side to the other. 

The foothills are mostly populated by sheep and their shepherds, 
but,  antiquarians  claim,  the  Hägercrybs  were  once  the  sacred 
burial  ground  of  the  Unberogens,  the  Human  tribe  of  Sigmar 
Himself.  Supporting  this,  ancient  cairns  can  be  seen  rising 
from  clearings  on  many  of  the  highlands,  some  of  which  are 
also marked by looming menhirs. Perhaps because of these, the 
Hägercrybs  have  a  foul  reputation  for  being  haunted,  and  few 
are willing to stray too deep into its forests. It is said those who 
do encounter thick fogs rising from ancient barrows, with moans 
of the dead echoing from within. Locally, such talk is nervously 
dismissed as the ravings of shepherds drunk on too much hard 
cider, for the alternative is to believe tales of ancient kings hungry 
for the blood of the living.

Ignoring  such  talk,  lords  of  the  Hägercrybs  repeatedly  order 
mines  be  sunk  into  the  hills  in  the  search  of  rare  metals  and 
minerals. Most fail, their miners never seen again, but a handful 
are successful, and have brought considerable wealth to the area.

The Skaag Hills
The rocky Skaag Hills lie to the west of the River Bögen and run 
along the southern bank of the Reik before falling beneath the 
trees  of  the  Duchy  of  Gorland.  Near  the  centre,  the  Reikwald 
recedes from the stony crags and layers of stratified rock rise to 
the scree-laden highlands of the Prie Ridge. A single road crosses 
the  gentler  slopes  of  the  Skaag  Hills  to  the  south,  starting  at 
Trosreut  in  the  shadow  of  Castle  Grauenberg  and  wending  its 
way  through  to  Holthausen,  but  many  minor  tracks  and  trails 
also cross the region, most of which started as goat tracks.

Clinging precariously to the craggy edge of the Grey Mountains, 
the southern lords of the Reikland have sunk many mines seeking 
to extract the significant mineral and metal wealth of the range. 
These are protected by lone watchtowers and high fortresses that 
stand guard against attack from the mountains, each surrounded 
by the rubble of older fortifications that failed.

Once, the hillsides were bustling with small mines boasting rich 
veins  of  silver  and  iron.    Down  through  the  centuries  most  of 
these  played  out,  leaving  many  abandoned  settlements,  many 
of which the forest reclaimed. Locals now approach such ruins 
cautiously, for hunters, outlaws, and far more sinister folk are said 
to make use of what intact buildings remain.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

The Vorbergland
Between the threatening peaks of the Grey Mountains and the 
deep forests of the Reikwald lies the Vorbergland, a hilly region 
extending the length of the Reikland known for its fertile valleys, 
rolling grasslands, and windswept plains.

The  productive 
south-eastern  provinces  around  Böhrn, 
Ubersreik,  Stimmigen,  and  Dunkelberg  are  known  locally  as 
Suden Vorbergland, and are the most heavily cultivated regions 
of the Reikland. They are peppered with many flourishing towns, 
villages, farms, and vineyards, and are often referred to as ‘Ranald’s 
Garden’ for the vast quantities of wine they produce for export.

Further  west,  the  Vorbergland  is  tormented  by  frequent  Orc 
and  Goblin  attacks  from  the  mountains,  meaning  much  of  the 
land is sparsely populated, little more than a hunting ground for 
wild animals and monsters from the peaks. This makes the local 
baronies and duchies a popular destination for game hunters and 
natural historians from the Imperial Zoo seeking to capture rare 
creatures,  though  only  the  unwise  travel  this  region  without  a 
heavy guard and knowledgeable guide.

Drachenberg
Soaring  high  above  central  Vorbergland,  its  base  wrapped  by 
the  shimmering  River  Bögen,  the  twisting  peak  known  as  the 
Drachenberg  can  be  seen  for  miles  around.  Whenever  trouble 
arises, the nearby townsfolk of Wheburg cast an eye towards the 
mountain and make the comet sign of Sigmar to ward evil, for 
Drachenberg has a fell reputation. Its name roughly translates to 
‘Dragon Peak’ and, true to its name, the mountain has long been 
a favoured haunt of the great beasts, as well as to other monstrous 
creatures such as Basilisks, Wyverns, and Manticores. 

The  immense  Red  Dragon,  Caledair  —  the  ‘Scythe  of  Fire’ 
—  once  made  her  lair  in  caves  near  the  peak  of  the  mountain, 
and  hunted  across  the  fields  of  the Vorbergland  for  uncounted 

generations. While she has not been seen for more than a century, 
none can say for certain if she is truly gone or if she sleeps in the 
mountain still.

The  Drachenberg  is  treacherous,  with  steep  sides  that  thwart 
climbers,  and  no  easy  routes  to  its  sheer  summit. Though  trees 
clog its foothills, they are sparse along its upper slopes and the 
top soil is very loose, which has caused more than one imprudent 
climber to slide free to a broken death. Even so, the brave and the 
foolish  still  attempt  to  climb  the  Drachenberg,  for  who  knows 
what treasures may lie hidden within its unknown heights?

The gRim, daRk foResTs
The widespread forests of the Reikland are regarded as some of 
the safest in the Empire, but stray from the busy rivers and tree-
lined roads and such impulsive talk is soon forgotten.  Uncharted 
miles of towering oak, pine, elm, and beech hide much more than 
desperate bandits and wild animals. And the deeper one goes, the 
more dangerous it is.

The Reikwald
The  Reikwald  blankets  almost  all  the  Reikland  outside  the 
Vorbergland,  only  thinning  around  the  jagged  Skaag  Hills  or 
where it is cleared by the towns and villages lining the Reik river 
and its many tributaries. Most travellers through the region prefer 
the  relative  safety  of  river  travel  to  journeying  along  uncertain 
roads,  and with  good reason;  the Reikwald  is  a favoured  haunt 
of outcasts, cut-throats, and other lawless folk. While all major 
routes  are  patrolled  by  road  wardens,  their  numbers  are  too 
few and the roads too long, so it’s not uncommon to encounter 
upturned coaches and other signs of banditry.  The majority of the 
open clearings and abandoned ruins from past wars are claimed 
as camps by outlaws or by one of the herds of Beastmen roaming 
the  deeper  wood,  and  forays  to  clear  these  isolated  places  by 
regiments of the Reikland State Army are not uncommon.

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

In most parts, the Reikwald’s canopy is not so overgrown as to 
block  sunlight,  but  its  depths  are  frequently  gloomy  and  heavy 
fogs are common, especially along the marshier stretches of the 
river  Reik.  Scholars  claim  before  the  Empire  was  founded  the 
Unberogen  tribe  of  Humans  ranged  across  this  misty  forest 
alongside  older  tribes  whose  names  are  now  lost  to  memory. 
Concentric  rings  of  carved  standing  stones  called ‘oghams’  still 
exist  from  this  era,  though  many  are  overgrown  and  almost 
impossible  to  find  without  a  guide.  Isolated  communities  still 
following ancient ways — old beliefs said to predate the coming 
of Sigmar — are said to hold such sites sacred. Intellectuals from 
the Colleges of Magic postulate terrible battles were once fought 
for these ancient, megalithic sites, and it’s not uncommon to find 
richer wizards funding explorations into the Reikwald’s depths to 
learn more about the magical stones.

Bloodpine Woods
South  of  Altdorf  an  outcrop  of  pine  trees  grows  down  the 
southern  face  of  the  magical  Amber  Hills  and  spills  into  the 
depths of the Reikwald. Called bloodpine for its deep-maroon 
wood, the lumber here is greatly desired by the artisans of Altdorf, 
and is most often used to produce exquisite furniture destined 
for the high-class markets of Marienburg and Nuln. Recently, 
bloodpine has become hard to source, for the Bloodpine Woods 
are  plagued  by  Forest  Goblins  of  the  Spiderclaw  tribe  who’ve 
managed  to  tame  a  handful  of  swift-moving  Giant  Spiders. 
Few  dare  to  work  there  now,  for  those  attempting  to  cut  the 
trees simply disappear, their cries echoing from the mists high 
in  the  trees  before  suddenly  falling  silent. This  has,  of  course, 
only served to increase the value of bloodpine, which has deeply 
enraged  purchasers,  several  of  whom  have  taken  to  hiring 
mercenaries  and  private  parties  to  clear  the  Goblins,  figuring 
it is cheaper to throw bodies at the problem than pay more for 
their new filing cabinet.

The Grissenwald
The  south-easternmost  end  of 
the  Reikwald  branches 
southwards along the Stirland border and thins out as it heads 
upriver towards the City-State of Nuln. This wide section of the 
forest  is  known  locally  as  the  Grissenwald,  a  tight  woodland 
packed with distorted trees and twisted undergrowth, the depths 
of which are said to be swarming with Beastmen, Witches, and 
tribes of feral Mutants. Because of this, most local woodsmen 
travel in groups and seldom stay outdoors come nightfall, and 
its commonplace to find fluttering bills posted on roadside trees 
offering rewards for the retrieval of lost family and friends from 
the bowels of the forest.

The RiveRs, Canals, and lakes
The  many  rivers  spilling  from  the  glacial  lakes  and  waterfalls 
of  the  Grey  Mountains  down  to  the  Reik  are  central  to  the 
Reikland’s  economic  success.  Barges  brimful  with  merchandise 
navigate the largest of these rivers, bringing diverse goods to the 
capital of Altdorf, many of which are then shipped elsewhere in 
the Empire or sold down the river to Marienburg. 

To  further  support  the  Reikland’s  wide-ranging  mercantile 
ambitions,  the  richer  noble  and  merchant  houses  invest  in 
extensive  canals  planned  and  constructed  by  Altdorf ’s  famous 
engineers.  The  impact  of  these  impressive  waterways  is 
undeniable,  with  trade  goods  moving  faster  than  ever  before, 
but they require maintenance and protection, both of which are 
costly. To ensure the wreckers and river pirates the canals attract 
have minimal impact, road wardens, guards, and riverwardens are 
employed as required, but frequently these are little better than 
the criminals they purportedly thwart.

The Reik
The Reik carries more traffic and trade than all the other rivers 
in  the  Old  World  combined.  Indeed,  so  massive  is  the  river 
that  almost  half  the  fresh  water  of  the  Old World  flows  down 
its  length,  for  it  not  only  drains  all  the  Reikland  with  its  many 
tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond. By the time the Reik 
flows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears 
more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard 
engineering  methods.  As  this  immense  watercourse  approaches 
Altdorf to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split 
into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form 
the foggy Altdorf Flats. Many of the thinner distributaries caused 
by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural centre for trade 
as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for 
many  hundreds  of  miles.  This  single  fact  has  secured  Altdorf ’s 
dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally.

Beyond the Altdorf Flats, the boggy channels reconverge and the 
Reik begins its long journey westwards to the sea. By this point, 
it is so wide the opposite bank sometimes slips into mist, and 
is  so  deep  that  even  the  largest  sea-faring  vessel  can  navigate 
without fear. Resultingly, warships of the Imperial Navy, some 
so  large  to  have  crews  out-numbering  the  populations  of 
smaller towns, not only patrol these waters, but are built there, 
most launching from the Reiksport, a deep-water harbour built 
on  the  shores  of  Altdorf.  Rocky  islands  are  common  in  this 
last stretch, most of which are secured with ancient fortresses, 
overridden by river pirates, or abandoned completely, boasting 
nothing more than a handful of old smugglers’ coves.

The Bögen
The people of Bögenhafen claim Bögenauer, their town’s patron 
deity, is responsible for the commerce-blessed state of the Bögen. 
A relatively placid river with a clear, smooth, but not overly swift 
flow,  the  Bögen  readily  allows  traffic  to  sail  upriver  nearly  as 
easily as down. Its great depth allows larger river going vessels to 
navigate safely from the Reik all the way to Bögenhafen. Though 
its source lies deep in the freezing peaks of the Grey Mountains, 
the Bögen turns warm as it flows through the hilly Vorbergland, 
which  frequently  causes  heavy  mists  to  gather  along  its  banks. 
Most  evenings,  fingers  of  roiling  fog  rise  from  the  Bögen, 
wrapping tendrils about nearby settlements and the surrounding 
Reikwald. This  is  frequently  thick  enough  to  obscure  vision,  so 
thieves,  smugglers,  and  worse  use  it  to  conceal  their  nocturnal 
activities.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

The Grünberg Canal
The  Grünberg  canal  is  a  recent  addition  to  the  waterways  of 
the  Reikland.  Commissioned  by  Emperor  Luitpold  III  as  part 
of  an  extensive  dowry  paid  to  the  previous  Baron  of  Grünburg, 
it  was  completed  in  2506IC  and  has  seen  heavy  use  ever  since. 
The canal bypasses the treacherous shallows of the Reiker Marshes 
overlooked  by  Castle  Reikguard,  and  it  now  takes  much  of  the 
river Teufel’s  barge  traffic  heading  for  Altdorf.  Grünburg’s  walls 
protect the tollhouse on the south end of the canal, and any barge 
wishing to pass it must pay a tax based on the length of the vessel 
entering the canal system. Queues are common at first light and 
dusk, but otherwise the tollhouse sees infrequent business.  At the 
north end there is a lock-keeper’s house on the outskirts of Prieze 
that doubles as a barracks and stables for the twelve road wardens 
paid to patrol the canal path and help any barges as required. This 
help typically comes in the form of impromptu protection taxes, 
which if not paid leave the offending barge open to bandit attacks. 
Attacks that inevitably follow for any who refuse to pay.

The Teufel
The Teufel  flows  down  from  the  mountains  to  Ubersreik,  then 
northwards  to  the  Reik  through  Auerswald  and  Grünburg.  Its 
waters  have  a  distinctly  reddish  hue  caused  by  iron  deposits  in 
the  mud  and  silt,  though  storytellers  suggest  it’s  the  unending 
wars  between  the  Grey  Mountain  Dwarfs  and  Goblins  that 
have  permanently  stained  the  river  red.  A  great  deal  of  rain 
feeds  into  the  Teufel  and  it  regularly  overflows,  especially  in 
spring,  frequently  flooding  its  mud-filled  waters  deep  into  the 
surrounding forest. Inns — often built high to avoid floodwater 
— are common along the Teufel, as are bandits, since much of the 
river runs through the Reikwald. Road wardens regularly patrol 
the banks of the Teufel and they are not fond of any that linger 
without good reason. 

The Vorbergland Canals
The  Vorbergland  Canals  are  an  engineering  marvel. 
Commissioned  by  the  previous  Archduke  of  Upper Teufel  in 
conjunction with merchant houses from Nuln and Marienburg, 
the  canals  are  the  pride  of  the  south,  carrying  trade  from 
Wissenland across the Vorbergland and back again. Comprised 
of five canals connecting five major tributaries of the Reik, the 
system  links  Nuln  through  to  Carroburg,  skipping  the  high 
taxes of Altdorf completely.

Recently,  the  Dwarfs  of  Karak  Azgaraz  sent  delegations  to 
the  lords  of  Suden Vorbergland  demanding  the  canals  be  shut, 
claiming  old  treaties  from  centuries  past  were  being  broken  by 
an unacceptably large display of shoddy workmanship. This has 
caused  an  uproar  from  graduates  of  the  Imperial  Engineers’ 
School  who  see  the  steam  locks  and  clever  water-pumps  as  a 
pinnacle of human engineering.

The Weissbruck Canal
Connecting the Bögen and Reik rivers — bypassing Middenland’s 
Carroburg  taxes  in  the  process  —  the  Weissbruck  canal  sees 
steady  traffic year-round  as trade flows  to and  from Altdorf. A 
toll to use the canal is paid once at whatever end a vessel enters. 
The  canal  is  25-feet  wide,  with  frequent  berthing  points  and 
numerous places to stay along its length. 

Local bargees do not readily discuss it with strangers, but there 
are many unusual stories whispered about the canal. Supposedly, 
the Dwarf engineers that designed it unearthed pre-Unberogen 
artefacts  when  they  first  dug  the  waterway,  and  things  have 
never been right in the area since. Some even swear that should 
Morrsleib — the smaller of the two moons — be full, one can sail 
the canal north to somewhere other than the Reik…

The CURsed and feTid maRshlands
Although  Middenland  to  the  north  claims  many  famous 
marshlands  —  such  as  the  Furdienst,  Midden  Marshes,  and 
Shadensumpf  —  the  river  banks  of  the  Reikland  are  no  less 
waterlogged, frequently giving way to fens, mires, and dangerous 
mud plains, especially down the length of mighty River Reik. The 
largest of these is the Grootscher Marsh on the border with the 
Wasteland,  but  many  other  examples  exist,  such  as  the  Altdorf 
Flats, the Reiker Marshes, and the Uhland Bogs.

Grootscher Marsh
The  largest  wetland  of  the  Reikland,  the  Grootscher  Marsh 
spreads out on both banks of the Reik. It extends some fifty miles 
into  the  Reikland  and  Middenland  from  the  border  with  the 
Wasteland, and is considered by many to be a cursed place, for 
it is the site of one of the Empire’s most famous military defeats 
of the last century: The Battle of Grootscher Marsh, where the 
Wasteland secured its independence from imperial rule.

In  modern  times,  the  Grootscher  Marsh  remains  the  foul-
smelling fenland it always was, filled with ill-sounding birds and 
infested  with  River  Trolls.  In  leaner  years,  when  meat  cannot 
be  found  for  their  rotting  larders,  the Trolls  grow  hungry  and 
rumour holds they slip into the Reik to pluck the unwary from 
passing ships. Being sent to clear out the  Grootscher  Marsh is 
considered  one  of  the  worst  punishment  details  imaginable  by 
the  State  Armies  of  the  Reikland;  even  the  hardiest  soldiers 
hesitate when ordered there. 

Travellers on the Reik occasionally report the sounds of strange, 
ominous  horns  echoing  through  the  thick  fogs  that  frequently 
coalesce across the marsh, and wise locals note Trolls don’t make 
use of such. Old hands on the Reik agree, and then swiftly change 
the subject… 

shroom Boom
physicians, apothecaries, and scholars all pay high prices for 
the  multitude  of  rare  mushrooms  and  unusual  plants  that 
only  grow  in  the  perilous  cursed  marsh  about  the  city  of 
marienburg. however, several crops of daemon’s tand, rood 
puffball, and dodeshors polypore, three of the most valuable 
Wastelander fungi, have recently been discovered growing in 
the  murk  of  the  Grootscher  Marsh.  Sensing  heavy  profits, 
Klaes adaans, an ever-frowning merchant lodging in the village 
of  oberseert  overlooking  the  marsh,  is  hiring  mushroom-
pickers  willing  to  brave  the  wetlands.  this  brings  increased 
activity that not only attracts hungry river trolls to the area, 
but also Goblins keen to capture them. Klaes cares little for 
such trivialities, and certainly won’t mention them; all he wants 
is a steady crop of lucrative fungus. those with stern hearts 
and keen eyes can reap real rewards here… or become meat 
for a troll’s larder.

Altdorf Flats 
The  rivers  Reik  and  Talabec  split  around  the  city  of  Altdorf 
into  hundreds  of  shifting  channels,  black-soiled  mudflats,  and 
marshes that spread north and south of the great city. Known as 
the  Altdorf  Flats,  these  wide  wetlands  are  dominated  by  rushes 
and  reeds,  and  are  notorious  for  their  foul  stench  and  slurping, 
River-Troll-infested bogs. Some twenty miles west of Altdorf, the 
snaking channels converge again into the wide River Reik, where 
the waters flow further westwards to the Princedom of Carroburg.

The  flats  are  crossed  by  six  primary  causeways  that  fan  from 
the  fertile  farmlands  immediately  surrounding  Altdorf.  Each 
causeway is punctuated by several stone bridges, some of which 
are  Dwarf-wrought  and  date  from  the  Time  of  Sigmar.  Their 
roads are ever-busy with coaches and merchant trains coming to 
and  from  the  capital,  so  are  heavily  patrolled  by  road  wardens. 
Similarly, the marshy waterways are a haven for smugglers looking 
to circumvent Altdorf ’s heavy tolls and taxes, so riverwarden and 
Shipswords are a frequent sight plying the unsure waters, seeking 
criminals and driving back larger marsh monsters.

Reiker Marshes
Lying between the Reiker Heights and the Hohesesienen Hills 
at  the  sluggish  confluence  of  the  River  Reik  and  the  River 
Teufel,  the  Reiker  Marshes  are  notoriously  treacherous,  and 
inexperienced captains frequently run aground in its deceptively 
shallow  waters.  Tattered  flags  and  corroded  signposts  mark 
the  most  perilous  sections,  but  these  are  woefully  insufficient. 
River  guides  locally  known  as  ‘huffers’  are  available  to  guide 
boats through the waters for a reasonable price, most of whom 
gather in the towns of Prieze and Babenborn on the Reik, and 
in  significantly  fewer  numbers  in  Buxhead  on  the Teufel. The 
waters  are  at  their  most  dangerous  in  the  five-mile  stretch  at 
the  end  of  the Teufel  where  it  meets  the  Reik.  Locally  called 
‘Leopold’s Folly’ after the emperor who tried, and failed, many 
times  to  dredge  the  red-silted  waters  in  order  to  make  it  safe 
for deep-drafted ships, wise barge captains avoid it completely, 
preferring  to  pay  tolls  to  pass  through  the  Grünberg  Canal 
rather than risk their crew and cargo.

Uhland Bogs
A windswept peatland lying to the south of the County of the 
West  March,  the  mossy  Uhland  Bogs  are  pierced  through  by 
the Westerfluss, the river that forms the natural border between 
the Wasteland and the Reikland. Towers of peat cut from the bog 
can  be  found  stacked  in  the  small  villages  near  the  mire,  where 
dried  blocks  are  used  to  fuel  local  fires  in  winter  or  shipped 
downriver to be sold along the Reik. In the south-west depths of 
the bog a number of ancient, carved stones rise from the sodden 
land, drawing local cultists of Rhya and older deities to worship 
during important equinoxes. One group of these stones, called the 
Crowstones, has a particularly foul reputation, and the surrounding 
bog is permanently blackened. Locals warn never to travel to the 
stones near the festival days of Geheimistag or Hexenstag, for they 
claim crows gather in impossible numbers and unspeakable things 
rise from the bog to wreak terror upon the living.

tImelIne oF the reIKland
Being a summary of the major events concerning the history of the Grand province of reikland.

c. -500 ic
the unberogen tribe of humans settle 
the land where altdorf now lies, and 
begin fortifying the area. It will be sacked 
many times by rival tribes, Beastmen, 
orcs, Goblins, and other vile creatures. 
nevertheless, the site is strategically 
important at the confluence of the Reik 
and talabec, and a mixture of conquest and 
trade helps the settlement flourish. Soon, 
scholars claim, the fortified town is known 
as the ‘rich village’, or reichsdorf. as 
centuries pass, this becomes reikdorf, with 
the surrounding land called the reikland.

-30 ic
a twin-tailed comet streaks through the 
sky, heralding the birth of sigmar to 
chief Björn of the unberogen tribe in 
reikdorf. the comet leads a crazed warparty 
of orcs to sigmar’s birthplace, and his 
mother, Griselda, is killed in the attack, 
leaving sigmar with a life-long hatred of 
Greenskins.

-15 ic
a merchant-train from Karaz-a-Karak is 
ambushed by orcs, and they capture King 
Kurgan Ironbeard. sigmar rescues the king, 
and in return is named a dawonger, dwarf-
friend, and given the king’s greatest heirloom, 
the magical warhammer Ghal-maraz.

-8 ic
after his father dies, sigmar becomes chief 
of the unberogen tribe.

-7 ic
sigmar realises the threat the Greenskins 
pose is far too much for his tribe to tackle 
alone, so he starts a campaign to bring all 
the surrounding human tribes under his 
rule.

-2 ic
after several years of warfare and diplomacy, 
sigmar binds twelve of the human tribes 
under his rule and allies himself with several 
more.

-1 ic
the First Battle for Black Fire pass. the 
largest horde of orcs and Goblins the 
world has seen is defeated by humans and 
dwarfs led by high chief sigmar and King 
Kurgan, ending the centuries-long Goblin 
Wars.

0 ic
sigmar is crowned emperor over the chiefs 
of the twelve tribes and the empire is 
born. the dwarf runesmith alaric the 
mad is commissioned to create twelve 
runeswords, one for each of the tribal 
chiefs, as a symbol of their office and 
as thanks for their sacrifices to end the 
Goblin Wars.

1 ic 
the First War against chaos. the newly 
founded empire is attacked by the forces of 
morkar the uniter, everchosen of chaos. 
the war is desperate, short, and devastating. 
eventually, morkar is slain by sigmar in a 
day-long battle that was said to have split 
the earth and rent the sky.

c. 2 ic
sigmar names the twelve tribal chiefs his 
‘counts’, which modern scholars claim can 
be sourced in the classical word comes, 
meaning ‘companion’, for they were his 
companions on the battlefield against the 
Greenskins and against the chaos tribes 
from the north.

c. 7 ic
sigmar kills the necromancer morath and 
takes the crown of sorcery. recognising its 
evil, sigmar locks it away beneath reikdorf.

11 ic
Battle of drakenmoor. the Great enchanter, 
constant drachenfels, leads an army of 
Goblins and daemons against sigmar’s 
new capital and suffers the first defeat of 
his eternal existence. this shocking loss 
will haunt him long after he reincorporates 
several centuries later.

15 ic
Battle of the river reik. nagash, the lord 
of undeath, gathers a shambling horde of 
unliving monsters, and attempts to claim the 
crown of sorcery from sigmar. the undead 
almost overwhelm the reiklanders and their 
dwarf allies, but, after an exhausting battle, 
sigmar eventually strikes nagash down, causing 
the unliving army to crumble to dust.

50 ic
After five decades of extraordinary rule, Sigmar 
vanishes. to avoid destroying sigmar’s empire, 
the tribal chiefs eventually agree to vote for 
a new emperor from their own number, and 
select siegrich of the asoborn tribe. thus, the 
counts became ‘elector counts’, and each swears 
to be a companion and protector of their 
elected emperor.

51 ic
emperor siegrich I dies in a hunting 
accident. after a fraught month, prince 
hedrich of the unberogens is elected 
emperor hedrich I, bringing the seat of the 
empire back to reikdorf.

69 ic
Johann helstrum arrives in reikdorf and 
claims to have holy visions concerning 
sigmar. he preaches that he witnessed 
sigmar’s ascension to Godhood. such is 
the love the unberogens have for their lost 
emperor, helstrum is readily believed.

73 ic
Johann helstrum builds a temple to sigmar 
in reikdorf. history will forever remember 
him as the first Grand Theogonist of 
the Cult of Sigmar, and the first man to 
recognise sigmar’s divinity.

c. 100 ic
emperor hedrich I receives the twelve 
runeblades from alaric the mad that were 
commissioned 100 years earlier. each of 
these ‘runefangs’ is a unique weapon of 
extraordinary power, and they are passed to 
the tribal chiefs. In time, the runefangs will 
become powerful symbols of the elector 
counts.

246 ic
a high temple to sigmar is completed 
in reikdorf, and it acts as the centre 
of worship for a cult that now extends 
throughout the empire. this rapid expansion 
leads to open conflict with the cults of 
ulric and taal.

990 ic
emperor ludwig I, commonly called ludwig 
the Fat, grants the Grand theogonist a vote 
to select the next emperor. though some 
elector counts cry foul, and the other cults 
are astounded at the blatant favouritism, 
emperor ludwig appears far more interested 
in the lavish banquets prepared for him by 
the cult of sigmar in reikdorf.

1000 ic
1000 years after sigmar was crowned 
emperor, the cult of sigmar completes a 
new high temple in reikdorf. It is the 
largest temple in all the empire, and cements 
sigmar worship as the primary cult in the 
reikland. In celebration, emperor ludwig 
I renames his city altdorf, demonstrating 
its age and importance to the empire as a 
whole.

1053-1115 ic
the rule of Boris Goldgather. emperor 
Boris I proves to be exceptionally unpopular 
and corrupt, with his rule known for 
exorbitant taxes, weak leadership, and a 
complete neglect of the military.

1106-1110 ic
rise of the drakwald: Beastmen and other 
vile creatures swarm from beneath the 
twisted bowers of the drakwald, sacking 
villages, towns, and fortifications across the 
drakwald province. When the last heir to 
the drakwald throne is slain in battle with 
an enormous Bestigor, emperor Boris I 
chooses to place the drakwald runefang in 
his altdorf palace. publicly, when a suitable 
heir is found, the runefang will be passed 
on. privately, Boris has no intention of ever 
giving up the magical blade.

1111-1115 ic
the Black plague. disease sweeps through 
the reikland, killing nine in every ten people, 
and debilitating half of those left alive. 
skaven then erupt from their under-empire 
and attack. When emperor Boris I dies of 
the plague in 1115 Ic, no-one replaces him in 
the ensuing anarchy. 

1115-1124 ic
the rat Wars. skaven move to 
systematically enslave the remaining 
population of the empire, and effectively 
wipe-out what remains of the drakwald 
province. In response, elector count 
mandred of middenland rallies a desperate 
defence, and with the help of elven allies 
from the laurelorn Forest, finally drives the 
skaven back below ground. at the end of 
the war, the victorious mandred is elected 
emperor by the three surviving elector 
bloodlines.

1152-1359 ic
age of Wars. emperor mandred II is 
assassinated by the skaven in 1152 Ic. the 
elector counts cannot agree on a successor 
as they are too concerned about rivals 
invading their devastated grand provinces, so 
a fraught interregnum ensues for over two 
centuries. during this time, the princes of the 
reikland rule their Grand province unfettered 
as civil war rages across the empire.

1359-1547 ic
the time of two emperors. In a desperate 
bid to end the bloodshed, the electors 
meet in altdorf and eventually agree on 
a choice for emperor, crowning elector 
count Wilhelm of stirland as emperor 
by a majority of one. elector countess 
ottila of talabecland is outraged at this, 
and claims the vote is rigged. When she 
returns to talabheim she declares herself 
empress without a vote, and is supported 
in her claim by the cults of taal and 
ulric. she then outlaws the cult of 
sigmar in talabecland, a decree that stands 
for almost a thousand years. the civil wars 
escalate.

1421 ic
shipbuilding rises to prominence in 
altdorf’s natural harbour, the reiksport. 
soon, quality vessels built in the reikland 
are plying the reik river system.

1489 ic
the prince of the reikland formally 
commissions a navy, worried about the 
influence of ships sailing from Talabheim, 
carroburg, nuln, and marienburg. to help 
limit their influence, Altdorf builds several 
low bridges across the reik and talabec to 
block larger ships and to control trade.

1547-1979 ic
the time of three emperors. after 
sigmarites botch an assassination attempt 
when electors refuse to back their choice 
for the next emperor, the elector count of 
middenland denounces the imperial elections 
as a corrupt sham, and declares himself the 
rightful emperor. he has the support of the 
cult of ulric, which had recently fallen out 
with the talabecland emperors. 

the empire now has three emperors: the 
electoral emperor supported by the cult of 
sigmar, the ottilian emperor supported by 
the cult of taal, and the Wolf emperor 
supported by the cult of ulric. the civil 
wars intensify. 

c. 1450-1550 ic
Knights returning rich from the crusades 
against araby found new knightly orders 
and chapterhouses across the reikland. they 
also fund the first temple of Myrmidia in 
altdorf, a simple building sponsored by the 
newly invested Knights of the Blazing sun.

1681 ic
the night of the restless dead. the dead 
stir in the Gardens of morr. corpses rise, 
bones rattle, and the dead walk the land, 
sowing terror and confusion. entire towns 
and villages are overrun before dawn brings 
a reprieve from the rapacious hunger of the 
deceased.

1707-1712 ic
WAAAGH! Gorbad! and the First Siege 
of altdorf. taking advantage of the divided 
empire, the orc Warboss Gorbad Ironclaw 
invades with a tide of Greenskins at his back, 
destroying the Grand province of solland, 
sacking nuln and much of Wissenland, and 
eventually sweeping through the reikland 
razing almost a third of its settlements before 
his green wave eventually breaks against the 
walls of altdorf; but not before the prince of 
altdorf, and electoral emperor, sigismund Iv 
is killed.

1940 ic
the poisoned Feast. the Great enchanter, 
constant drachenfels, in one of his most 
famous treacheries, invites the electoral 
emperor, carolus II, and the entire 
imperial court and its families, to a 
great feast held in his castle. drachenfels 
poisons his guests, paralysing them. he 
then starves them to death in front of the 
marvellous banquet he prepared. this wipes 
out several important noble bloodlines of 
the reikland, deeply destabilising the grand 
province and the electoral emperors as a 
whole.

1979-2303 ic
the dark ages. elector countess magritta 
of Westerland is elected empress, but the 
cult of sigmar refuses to crown her, or 
indeed any other elector count or countess, 
leaving the electoral emperors without a 
voted emperor. the entire electoral system 
collapses, and soon most provinces fight only 
for themselves. petty warlords claim titles on 
a whim as new kingdoms, counties, duchies, 
princedoms and more rise and fall as terror 
spreads across the former empire.

2010-2146 ic
the vampire Wars. the empire has 
collapsed into thousands of competing 
factions, and the vampire lords of sylvania 
rise to exploit the turmoil. In total, three 
major wars result as three different vampire 
counts attempt to eradicate the fractured 
empire. each time, the vampires are driven 
back through a mixture of unlikely alliances, 
desperate gambits, and clever strategy.

2051 ic
second siege of altdorf. the vampire 
lord vlad von carstein is slain. his wife, 
Isabella von carstein, commits suicide, 
unable to continue unlife without him. their 
armies soon splinter into feuding factions, 
ending the First vampire Wars.

2100 ic
after the inconclusive Battle of Four armies 
ended in multiple assassination attempts by 
supposed allies on the empire side, it is 
decided that it is time to elect an emperor to 
pull everyone together. elector count helmut 
is the most popular candidate for this, until 
its discovered he is actually a zombie in 
the thrall of Konrad von carstein, the very 
vampire lord they are trying to defeat. all 
plans to elect an emperor are abandoned.

2135 ic
third siege of altdorf. the vampire lord 
mannfred von carstein launches a surprise 
winter attack on the reikland capital as it 
recuperated from a summer of civil conflicts 
but is eventually driven back when the Grand 
theogonist of sigmar uses a forbidden spell 
to unbind the vampire’s necromancy.

2203 ic
a rift into the realms of chaos opens 
at castle drachenfels, resulting in the 
annihilation of almost every living soul from 
Bögenhafen to ubersreik. after more than a 
week of terror, the rift mysteriously closes.

2302-2304 ic
the Great War against chaos. asavar 
Kul, everchosen of chaos, leads a horde 
of unimaginable size into Kislev, laying 
waste to everything in his path. In response, 
magnus von Bildhofen, a young nulner noble 
claiming to be inspired by sigmar, rallies the 
fractured and broken empire into a mighty 
army to relieve Kislev. he eventually defeats 
asavar Kul at the Gates of Kislev alongside 
Kislevite, dwarf, and elven allies.

2304-2369 ic
the reign of magnus the pious. magnus 
von Bildhofen is elected emperor magnus 
I, the first elected emperor representing 
all sigmar’s Grand provinces for almost 
a thousand years. riding the wave of 
popularity he secured by winning the Great 
War against chaos, he immediately initiates 
sweeping reforms to end the corruption 
that previously brought the empire to 
its knees, creating new laws to limit the 
nobility, cults, guilds and much more. he 
also oversees the foundation of many new 
institutions, including the formal creation 
of the empire state armies, Imperial navy, 
and, controversially, the colleges of magic 
in altdorf, making magic legal across all the 
Empire for the first time. 

2308-2310 ic
the third parravon War. the Bretonnian 
duchy of parravon invades the reikland 
across the Grey lady pass, claiming the 
military escalation in ubersreik caused by the 

mustering of the new state army breaks 
an ancient treaty. they are quickly driven 
back, and the following year parravon is 
besieged. eventually, after a year of occasional 
skirmishes outside parravon’s extraordinarily 
high walls, and a great deal of standing 
around shouting insults, the King of 
Bretonnia treats on behalf of parravon with 
emperor magnus I, ending the war.

2402-2405 ic
the Fourth parravon War. the Bretonnian 
duchy of parravon again invades the 
reikland across the Grey lady pass. 
ubersreik is besieged twice during the 
war, but doesn’t fall. peace is eventually 
brokered by the intervention of emperor 
dieter Iv who agrees to pay the parravonese 
an extortionate sum of money to retreat, 
drawing much criticism at court.

2415 ic
the night of a thousand arcane duels. War 
erupts between the eight colleges of magic 
in altdorf, razing large sections of the city 
and resulting in the death of six of the eight 
patriarchs. the cult of sigmar pressures the 
prince of altdorf and emperor dieter Iv 
to lock the colleges down, which they do, 
resulting in the execution of many wizards, 
and effectively bringing legal magic use to 
an end in the empire. many of the surviving 
wizards flee the Colleges, never to return.

2420-2424 ic
WAAAGH! Grom! the Goblin Warboss 
Grom the paunch leads an enormous horde 
of Greenskins across the empire, sacking 
many reikland towns and villages, before 
eventually heading westwards, undefeated, 
where he then takes to the sea. the lack 
of wizards from the suspended colleges of 
magic is widely blamed for the repeated 
military defeats suffered by reikland’s 
armies.

2429 ic
Westerland buys its independence from 
the empire by bribing emperor dieter Iv, 
reforming itself as the Wasteland with 
marienburg as its capital. using anti-
corruption laws put in place by magnus the 
pious almost a hundred years earlier, the 

elector counts depose dieter in the ensuing 
scandal. he is replaced by Grand prince 
Wilhelm of house holswig-schliestein 
of the reikland, who is named emperor 
Wilhelm III, starting the imperial dynasty 
that rules the empire to this day.

the Battle for Grootscher marsh. 
emperor Wilhelm III, under pressure 
from the elector counts to respond 
to the Wasteland’s secession from the 
empire, gathers the state armies to invade 
marienburg. In late autumn, the opposing 
forces meet at the Grootscher marsh just 
outside siert, and the empire is routed by 
the advanced marienburg navy, well-trained 
mercenaries and militias, and the magics 
of the Wasteland’s high elven allies. 
Begrudgingly, Wilhelm verbally recognises 
the Wasteland’s independence, but refuses 
to ratify it with a treaty. marienburg accepts 
this and draws their new border at siert.

2430 ic
appalled at the state army’s inability to 
effectively counteract the elven mages and 
marienburg ships, emperor Wilhelm III 
reinstates the colleges of magic after their 
15-year suspension and invests significant 
resources into shipbuilding at the reiksport.

2431 ic
the Great Fire of altdorf. the newly 
reinstated Bright college accidentally sets 
Altdorf alight when a spell misfires, burning 
many buildings to the ground. many lobby 
emperor Wilhelm III hard to suspend the 
colleges again, but eventually he decides to 
keep them open, but with greater oversight 
from the cult of sigmar.

2453 ic
Fourth siege of altdorf. the liche King, 
arkhan the Black, invades the reikland 
with a seemingly endless swarm of walking 
corpses that march straight for altdorf. 
once the siege begins, arkhan slips 
unnoticed into the high temple of sigmar 
and steals the dreaded liber mortis kept 
within. minutes after he escapes, his army 
collapses, leaving thousands of carcasses 
mouldering outside the city walls as state 
soldiers look on in confusion and relief.

2480 ic
In drachenfels castle, constant drachenfels 
is slain by crown prince oswald von 
Königswald of ostland.

2483 ic
emperor luitpold III signs treaties with 
the Wasteland to allow warships of the 
Imperial navy to pass through the city-port 
of Marienburg. For the first time since the 
secession of the Wasteland, the reiklander 
navy is sailing the high seas, although the 
tolls to do so are extortionate.

2502 ic
emperor luitpold III dies in his sleep. In 
a close vote, luitpold’s son is elected to 
replace him, and is crowned emperor Karl-
Franz I in the high temple of sigmar in 
altdorf.

2505 ic
By imperial appointment, the playwright 
detlef seirk attempts to stage an ambitious 
play in castle drachenfels for emperor 
Karl-Franz and the gathered nobility of the 
empire. It goes disastrously wrong.

2508 ic
malathrax the mighty, an enormous 
Doomfire Dragon, terrorises the 
vorbergland, razing villages and taking 
livestock, before its driven north across the 
hägercrybs. after several months of pursuit, 
and the eradication of the entire Knightly 
order of the ebon sword, the dragon is 
slain by the Imperial huntsmarshal, markus 
Wulfhart, who places three arrows in its 
heart.

PoliticS

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

The  Reikland  perceives  itself  as  a  progressive,  civilised  realm, 
standing apart from the backward barbarity of the other provinces. 
It  is  ruled  by  an  Elector  Count  bearing  the  title  ‘Grand  Prince 
of  the  Reikland’  —  the ‘grand’  appellation  indicating  the  prince 
is an elector for the next emperor when the current one dies. The 
grand prince’s land is divided into a patchwork of individual fiefs 
governed  by  dukes,  counts,  margraves,  high  priests,  abbots  and 
other  rulers.  These  provinces,  whose  lords  swear  directly  to  the 
grand  prince,  are  collectively  titled  the  ‘Reikland  Estates’,  most 
of  which  have  been  ruled  by  the  same  families  or  institutions 
for  uncounted  generations,  affording  them  significant  influence.
The grand prince’s decrees are ratified by the ‘Reikland Diet’, an 
assembly comprised of the lords of the Reikland Estates. However, 
certain  powers  were  reserved  for  the  crown  during  Magnus  the 
Pious’s  Imperial  Reforms  two  centuries  ago,  including:  the  right 
to  summon  and  command  the  State  Army  of  the  Reikland,  the 
raising of emergency taxes in times of crisis, the right to authorise 
new coinage, and the right to call a High Lord Steward’s Court 
should a powerful noble be charged with a crime.

Reikland CoUnCil
The  day-to-day  business  of  ruling  the  province  is  handled  by 
the  Reikland  Council,  which  comprises  ten  ‘High  Lords’. The 
council meets weekly in the Wilhelm Chamber of the Volkshalle 
in Altdorf to discuss matters of import. It is rare for more than six 
of the high lords to attend simultaneously, and almost unheard of 
for the prince to attend in person.

The High Lords of the Reikland
The Ten High Lords of the Council of the Reikland, are appointed 
by the grand prince. Whilst most commoners could never hope 
to encounter such luminaries, their agents and representatives can 
be found everywhere.

High Lord of the Chair
A close advisor to the grand prince, the High Lord of the Chair 
officially leads the Reikland Council in the elector count’s stead.

The current High Lord of the Chair, the stoic Graf Archibold 
von  Lilahalle,  was  granted  the  influential  position  after  being 
gravely wounded whilst saving the life of Emperor Luitpold III 
from an assassin’s blade. Lingering, painful injuries confine him 
to  a  steam-driven  wheelchair;  an  irony  only  the  unwise  note 
aloud.

High Lord Steward
The High Lord Steward is the only man legally allowed to judge 
a crime committed by the lord of a Reikland Estate. As a High 
Lord Stewart’s Court is rarely called — most lords being simply 
too powerful to call to task — the position is largely ceremonial. 
Nevertheless, the High Lord Steward is arguably the most senior 
High Lord, and often stands in for the Grand Prince when he is 
unable — or unwilling — to attend court.

The  current  High  Lord  Steward  is  Archduke  Adelbert  von 
Bögenberg, a quiet man with little experience of the law, but a 
shrewd understanding of people. As much of the grand prince’s 
time  is  taken  up  with  imperial  matters,  he  is  arguably  the de 
facto ruler of the Reikland, much to the High Lord of the Chair’s 
chagrin.

High Lord Treasurer
The  High  Lord  Treasurer  is  responsible  for  the  Reikland’s 
treasury and for raising revenues. The position is extraordinarily 
important and is almost always held by a close ally of the crown.

The  current  High  Lord  Treasurer  is  the  aging  genius  Grafina 
Elena von Midwald, a dear friend of the previous grand prince, 
well known for her outspoken appreciation of fine wine and fine 
men.

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

X

High Lord Ambassador
The  High  Lord  Ambassador  organises  the  Reikland’s  foreign 
relations  and  runs  the  Altdorf  Black  Chamber:  the  infamous 
spies of the Reikland.

Graf Liepmund Holzkrug, the current High Lord Ambassador, 
is  an  intense,  fiercely  ambitious  man,  whose  family  are  strong 
rivals to House Holswig-Schliestein in Altdorf. He is known for 
his vindictive nature, his ruthless politics, and his love of hunting 
rare and exotic game.

High Lord Judge
The High Lord Judge is the ultimate voice on all Reiklander Law, 
which is quite different from Imperial Law.

The  current  High  Lord  Judge  of  the  Reikland  also  serves  as 
Supreme  Law  Lord  of  the  Empire:  Lector  Agatha  von  Böhrn 
of  Verena.  She  is  experienced  in  all  legal  matters,  and  widely 
regarded  as  one  of  the  most  intelligent  people  in  the  Empire, 
especially by those who have bribed her.

High Lord Chancellor
The High Lord Chancellor is the crown’s spiritual  advisor, and 
oversees the Reikland Chancery and the Silver Seal. 

The  current  High  Lord  Chancellor  is  High  Priestess  Halma 
Habermann of Sigmar, a robust woman with a pale complexion, 
rosy  cheeks,  and  thick  limbs.  Though  generally  charming  and 
approachable,  she  is  zealously  out-spoken  in  her  opposition 
to  the  Colleges  of  Magic,  and  rumours  abound  regarding  the 
atrocities  she  witnessed  during  her  service  in  the  Order  of  the 
Silver Hammer.  

High Lord Chamberlain
The High Lord Chamberlain runs the Palace of Altdorf and the 
adjoining  Volkshall.  The  position  is  arguably  one  of  the  most 
influential in the Reikland, as most high-level imperial politics take 
place within the chamberlain’s domain.

The current High Lord Chamberlain is rake-thin Duchess Elze 
von Skaag, an astute negotiator and careful planner who publicly 
supports  Emperor  Karl-Franz  in  all  matters.  Elze’s  husband, 
Duke  Alardus  von  Skaag,  is  said  to  be  deeply  frustrated  at  his 
wife  residing  in  Altdorf  and  not  in  Skaggerdorf  with  him;  by 
comparison, it seems to suit her perfectly as most evenings she 
can be found carousing through the city with her bodyguards.

High Lord Reiksmarshal
The  High  Lord  Reiksmarshal  is  responsible  for  leading  the 
armies of the Reikland, and ensuring each of the Reikland State 
Regiments is raised, financed, and made available to the crown 
as required.

The  current  Reiksmarshal  is  the  veteran  general  Duke  Kurt 
Helborg,  close  friend  and  tutor  to  the  current  grand  prince  — 
Emperor  Karl-Franz  —  and  said  to  be  the  finest  swordsman 

in the Empire. Helborg’s military commitments ensure that he 
rarely takes his seat on the council, a circumstance that suits his 
natural inclination.

High Lord Constable
The  High  Lord  Constable  is  the  ultimate  authority  on  the 
genealogy and heraldry of the Reikland.

The  current  High  Lord  Constable  is  smiling  Grafina  Matrella 
von  Achern,  a  woman  with  no  interest  in  genealogy,  but  a 
voracious appetite for political intrigue. She has made the most of 
this relatively inconsequential position, by chairing several private 
councils on the Grand Prince’s behalf. It is hard to reconcile the 
bubbly,  maternal  demeanour  she  projects,  and  her  reputation 
amongst her peers as the most ruthless woman in the Reikland.

High Lord Admiral
The High Lord Admiral is responsible for the Admiralty of the 
Reik, and thus the entire Reikland navy.

The  current  High  Lord  Admiral  is  the  venerable  Sea  Lord 
Adalmann  von  Hopfberg. The  Sea  Lord  —  who  is  now  quite 
senile  —  took  residency  in  the  Great  Hospice  some  fifteen 
years ago, and the Admiralty has governed the navy without his 
influence — or interference — since then.

The Reikland dieT
The  Reikland  Diet,  which  meets  as  required  in  the  Holzkrug 
Chamber  of  the  Volkshall  in  Altdorf,  is  responsible  for 
scrutinising  decrees  issued  by  the  Grand  Prince  of  Reikland, 
either  passing  them  or  returning  them  to  the  crown  with 
suggested amendments.

As most lords of the Reikland Estates don’t have time to attend 
the  diet  themselves,  they  generally  send  favoured  children, 
spouses, relatives, or minions in their place, although decrees of 
significant import will often bring worried lords from across the 
Reikland  to  attend  in  person.  Given  the  number  of  agents  the 
Grand Prince of Reikland tasks to influence the Reikland Diet, 
most votes are a formality.

The Reikland esTaTes
The  Reikland  Estates  are  ruled  by  vassals  of  the  Grand  Prince 
of  Reikland.   Their  rulers  can  do  as  they  will  with  their  lands, 
parcelling out fiefs to family and friends as they wish — though 
the creation of new hereditary titles requires the approval of the 
Prince of Reikland and the Reikland Diet. 

Each estate has a range of distinct legal and military obligations 
to the crown, but all are required to build and maintain at least one 
regiment  for  the  Reikland  State  Army,  soldiers  typically  used  in 
peacetime as watchmen, road wardens, or guards. Most Reikland 
Estates are feudal, comprised of smaller fiefs ruled by vassals, many 
of whom hold hereditary titles that have existed for centuries.

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

sample reIKland estate
the Barony of Böhrn is a reikland estate of the vorbergland ruled by house Böhrn for over four centuries. Baroness agetta holds 
court in the town of siedlung and currently has six vassals: three with hereditary titles — Baron markham of siebbach, countess 
osterhild of Kaltenwald, and Baron Baltzer of ettlindal — and three with non-hereditary titles, all of which were appointed by agetta 
personally — Warden Fabian of ort, Warden luethold of Koff, and castellan Fronika of neumarkt. the three hereditary vassals have, 
in turn, a total of seven vassals of their own.

The Baroness does not attend the Reikland Diet; instead she relies on her influential younger sister, lector Agatha von Böhrn, to watch 
over it in her place. agatha resides in altdorf serving as a member of the Imperial council of state and the reikland council, as well 
as tending to her duties as a lector of verena.

SettlementS

The  Reikland  prides  itself  as  one  of  the  most  populated  and 
civilised  of  the  Empire’s  grand  provinces.  Nevertheless,  great 
swathes  of  the  realm  are  still  wild,  blanketed  in  forest  and 
untouched  by  Human  hand.  Though  these  woodlands  are 
relatively safe when compared to the extraordinary dangers found 
in the great forests elsewhere in the Empire, the darker corners 
of the Reikwald are still home to all manner of terrible creatures. 

So,  even  after  two  thousand  five  hundred  years  of  expansion, 
most  Reikland  settlements  are  found  along  the  Reik  and  its 
many tributaries, connected by river if not always by road. It is 
only to the south of the Vorbergland, in the breadbasket of the 
Reikland, that rural settlements spread freely, connected by well-
maintained roads and remarkable canals.

alTdoRf and The manifold Towns
It  is  said  that  all  the  roads  and  the  rivers  lead  to  Altdorf,  the 
largest,  richest  city  of  the  Empire,  but  there  are  many  other 
interesting  places  to  visit  beyond  that  city’s  high,  white  walls. 
Numerous  towns,  both  large  and  small,  can  be  found  across 
the  Reikland,  most  acting  as  centres  of  trade  or  manufacture. 
A  growing  number  of  these  flourishing  centres  of  commerce 
also hold the status of ‘freistadt’, meaning they are ‘free towns’: 
granted  charters  to  govern  themselves,  usually  via  a  council  of 
burgomeisters with little or no interference from the local noble 
houses.

Altdorf 
Emperor Karl-Franz I holds court in Altdorf, the capital of the 
Reikland and the Empire as a whole. It stands proudly at the 
confluence of the mighty Reik and Talabec rivers, as well as at 

278

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

the end of many major trade routes, and is easily the wealthiest 
city  in  the  Empire.  This  ensures  it  is  always  expanding  and 
renewing,  with  fresh,  wide-eyed  hopefuls  arriving  daily,  and 
more commissions for new bridges, buildings, and engineering 
marvels presented weekly to the city’s burgomeisters than most 
cities consider in a year.

famed  Imperial  Engineers’  School  —  founded  by Tilean  genius 
Leonardo da Miragliano — also lies within Altdorf ’s walls. Here 
some of the Empire’s bravest, and most reckless, souls devise new 
and inventive methods for raining fiery death on the enemies of 
mankind. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the school has been rebuilt over 
a dozen times since it was founded. 

Today, Altdorf is a city of steam-powered bridges, mismatched 
islands,  enormous  tenements,  and  seemingly  endless  hordes  of 
people: one cannot traverse its crooked streets without becoming 
intimately  familiar  with  complete  strangers.  Because  it  draws 
merchants and diplomats from across the Known World, it is also 
surprisingly cosmopolitan; not only do folk of all ranks, species, 
creeds,  and  backgrounds  rub  shoulders  freely,  but  even  wizards 
are a common sight, rarely receiving more hostility than a wary 
glance or muttered blessing. 

Always surprising outsiders, a populous Elf quarter thrives near 
the Reiksport — Altdorf ’s deep-water harbour and shipyard — 
founded by High Elf merchant princes trading up the Reik from 
Marienburg  over  a  century  ago.  The  old  alliance  between  the 
Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar’s time and ensures 
many  Dwarf  clans  also  reside  there  in  tight-knit  communities, 
some having toiled on the city’s stonework for untold generations, 
though naturally their stubborn natures preclude them from ever 
calling Altdorf home. There is even a healthy Halfling population, 
with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales 
in Altdorf ’s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city’s 
sizeable Ogre population. Even odder creatures also call the city 
home, with none more fantastic than those found in the Imperial 
Zoo,  which  boasts  myriad  monsters  and  animals  including  the 
Abomination  of  Stirland  and  the  Drakwald  Gibberbeast,  each 
caged and displayed for the amusement of all. 

This  enormous  and  varied  population  helps  secure  one  of 
Altdorf ’s more notorious traits: it is infamously smelly, known 
affectionately, and all too accurately, as ‘The Great Reek’. During 
the hot, summer months the stench rolling in from the Altdorf 
Flats grows so potent that many of the city’s wealthiest citizens 
flee to country estates or the sumptuous, sun-kissed palaces of 
Grenstadt in Southern Averland. 

The ever-present fetor does little to ease Altdorf ’s citizenry, a 
mob  known  for  being  uniquely  vocal  and  prone  to  rioting  at 
any  imagined  slight,  especially  if  it  involves  new  taxes.  Even 
seemingly trivial actions of the local burgomeisters and nobles 
can earn their ire; but the fact that many of their protests are 
entirely fair does not lessen the crown’s fervour in quashing any 
rebellious rabbles that may take to the streets.

Altdorf  is  also  a  renowned  centre  for  learning.  The  sons  and 
daughters of wealthy households matriculate at the University of 
Altdorf,  often  with  little  regard  to  academic  ability;  those  with 
scholarly  potential,  but  without  the  financial  clout  to  match  it, 
often find their way to the High Temple of Verena, for the Goddess 
of Wisdom always has space for those blessed with intellect. The 

Arguably the most significant educational institution in Altdorf 
is also its most mysterious: The Colleges of Magic. Founded over 
two centuries ago at the behest of Emperor Magnus the Pious, 
the colleges are guided by the principles and precepts of the elven 
Loremaster Teclis. The colleges are charged with training magically 
gifted  citizens  to  channel  their  dangerous  talents  in  the  defence 
of  the  Empire.  Rumours  of  the  warping  influence  of  the  potent 
magical energies gathered by so many wizards living in such close 
proximity persist; allegedly the very streets of the capital have been 
twisted,  and  certain  college  buildings  are  believed  to  be  hidden 
from all but those few blessed — or should that be cursed — with 
witchsight, but few believe such talk.

Standing in stark contrast to the arcane mysteries of the Colleges 
of Magic, and as a bulwark against any errant witches or rogue 
wizards, Altdorf is also the beating heart of the Cult of Sigmar. 
Over  two-thousand  five-hundred  years  ago,  Sigmar  was  born, 
raised,  and  eventually  crowned  as  first  emperor  within  the 
boundaries of modern Altdorf, and fittingly the city now boasts 
more  Sigmarite  temples  and  holy  sites  than  all  the  other  cities 
of the Empire combined. Indeed, it is often said that one cannot 
throw a heretic without hitting a temple of Sigmar in the city. 

’specIal’ delIvery
a merchant is offering a ludicrously large fee to whomever will 
deliver a package. the catch is the package is bound for one of 
the Colleges of Magic; the merchant claims to be terrified of 
wizards. to complicate matters, no-one actually knows where 
the college in question — the light college — can be found, 
with some claiming that it exists ‘outside of normal space’ – 
whatever that means. the package is warm to the touch and 
seems to vibrate faintly when pressed; just how desperate for 
cash are the would-be messengers?

Auerswald
The  lively  town  of  Auerswald  rises  by  the  confluences  of  the 
Teufel, Tranig, and Ober rivers, so is on one of the busiest — and 
thus best patrolled — trade routes of the Reikland. The folk of 
Auerswald  tend  to  be  strong  willed  and  determined,  but  their 
easy charm and famous wit ensures no matter how steely their 
negotiations, they rarely cause offence.  

The  ruling  graf,  Ferdinand  von Wallenstein,  leaves  the  running 
of  Auerswald  to  a  council  of  burgomeisters,  far  preferring  his 
luxurious  palaces  in  Altdorf  and  Nuln  to  dirtying  his  hands 

279

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

with  direct  rule.  His  uncle,  Lord  Adelbert  von  Wallenstein,  is 
a  grizzled  but  hale,  old  warhorse  who  spends  most  of  his  days 
rooting out Goblins and bandits in the Reikwald to the east of 
the town.

Much  of  Auerswald  is  built  on  thick  stilts  over  the  flood-
plain  of  the  river  Teufel,  which  is  often  in  spate.  Connected 
by  a  bewildering  labyrinth  of  ramps,  bridges  and  rope  ladders, 
outsiders can easily become lost. More than one careless carouser 
has fallen to a muddy death after over-indulging themselves in 
the local taverns. 

In recent years, rumours have sprung up about an organised gang 
of  blackmailers  and  confidence  tricksters  operating  from  the 
town, though no witnesses have lived long enough to testify to 
their existence. 

Bögenhafen
The largest and most prosperous of all the Vorbergland’s market 
towns,  Bögenhafen  lies  in  the  very  heart  of  the  Reikland  and 
serves as the crossroads of the grand province. Lying equidistant 
between the capitals of Altdorf and Monfort, it is a crucial stop 
on the principle trade route between The Empire and Bretonnia. 
Goods from Bretonnia and the four corners  of  the  Empire are 
traded here for local lumber, wool, and metals shipped down from 
the Grey Mountains.

Bögenhafen  is  located  in  Graf  Wilhelm  von  Saponatheim’s 
duchy, but he is quite content to let the town be run by a local 
council  —  whose  membership  is  dominated  by  members  of 
the local Merchants’ Guild, as well as representatives from the 
Stevedores  and Teamsters’  Guild  —  so  long  as  they  keep  the 
money flowing his way. As goods coming north are transferred 
from  wagon  to  barge  in  Bögenhafen,  the  city  is  always  well 
stocked  with  warehouses  full  to  the  brim  of  fine  wines  and 
expensive, fragrant cheeses. 

dIrty BusIness
The  citizens  of  Bögenhafen  are  justifiably  proud  of  their 
bustling town for many reasons, not least of which is their 
extensive  sewers  that  are  well-maintained  by  the  town’s 
masons’ Guild. pleasing local gangs of criminals, the privacy 
of the sewer system has proven to be something of a boon to 
smugglers looking to avoid the taxes, tariffs, and fees levied by 
the guilds and nobles of the unknowing town above. 

the town watch regularly hires interested citizens to sweep the 
sewers for miscreants and ne’er-do-wells; of course, criminal 
gangs  aren’t  the  only  danger  that  might  be  found  lurking 
beneath Bögenhafen…

Diesdorf
One  of  many  towns  lying  on  the  River  Reik  between  Altdorf 
and  Nuln,  Diesdorf  and  its  surrounding  villages  are  dedicated 
to the production of corn, which is mostly traded downriver to 
the capital. The town’s reliance on a single crop does mean that 
should  a  blight  cause  the  corn  to  die  off,  the  town  itself  may 
follow. However, those who visit Diesdorf may conclude that its 
chief export is, in truth, religious fervour. Magnus the Pious once 
gave a legendarily powerful speech in the town after folk travelled 
far and wide to hear him. 

Ever since, Diesdorf became a major pilgrimage site for devout 
Sigmarites, and on holy days the town’s population is frequently 
doubled. Despite its relatively small size, Diesdorf has numerous 
temples  and  shrines  to  Sigmar,  and  most  families  in  the  town 
have at least one member serving in the Sigmarite clergy.

Dunkelberg
Southernmost of the Reikland’s major trade centres, the market 
town of Dunkelberg stretches across several hills along the banks 
of  the River Grissen. The older, richer portions  of the town  sit 
high on the hills, giving the nobles, and the rising merchant class 
wealthy enough to afford the oldest townhouses, a commanding 
view of the surrounding countryside. Despite its ever-increasing 
size, travellers note Dunkelberg’s ‘rustic’ feel, with regular markets 
clogging  its  winding  streets.  There  shoppers  can  purchase 
livestock; local produce; several excellent, fruity wines produced 
by the surrounding villages; and hand-crafted goods from across 
the Suden Vorbergland. Wide-ranging ‘bleachfields’ extend from 
the town, where local linen is dyed white by the sun around crops.

Dunkelberg’s  position  near  the  looming  Grey  Mountains  and 
the  wild  Graugrissen  forest  leads  to  regular  raids  by  Goblin 
tribes. While  the  richer  portions  of  the  town  are  well  fortified 
and protected by a high, stone wall, the rest lack any significant 
defences. As such, the poorer citizenry have learned not to grow 
too attached to their homes, belongings, or loved ones.

epicures  travel  to  the  town  to  sample  its  wares  from  the  many 
drinking houses,  breweries, and vineyards  on  offer.  Some  claim 
the high number of visiting Bretonnians — drawn by the excellent 
wine — may account for the locals’ recent enthusiasm for beer.

Grünburg
Downriver  from  several  major  trading  towns,  Grünburg  is  no 
stranger to trade goods bound for the Reik, but it is in riverboat 
manufacture  that  Grünburg  truly  excels.  The  town’s  boatyards 
are in constant operation, churning out the barges that keep the 
Reikland’s trade afloat. 

The  open  fields  to  the  south-east  of  Grünburg  appear  verdant 
and peaceful, but are known locally as the Battle Plains. It was 
here, long ago, the ruthless advance of the fearsome Orc Warlord 
Gorbad Ironclaw was finally stalled. Uniquely in Imperial military 
history, the Battle of Grünburg was almost entirely contested by 
mounted  troops  on  both  sides. This  quirk  of  history  has  made 
the Battle Plains a site of interest for archaeologists, antiquarians, 
and grave robbers, all keen to excavate debris from beneath the 
blood-soaked earth. 

orphan WhIte
dunkelberg has an excess of orphans, the result of frequent 
Goblin  raids,  diseases,  and  other  unpleasant  occurrences. 
rather  than  leave  them  underfoot,  the  local  duke  has 
established  a  number  of  orphanages  to  provide  shelter  and 
sustenance  for  the  children;  however,  to  earn  their  keep,  he 
puts  the  orphans,  clad  in  their  distinctive  white  uniforms, 
to work in the bleachfields. visitors to Dunkelberg may be 
shocked to see so many urchins deployed as a labour force, 
though the callous disregard many of the wealthy of the town 
have  developed  toward  orphan  children  is  perhaps  worse. 
sister alella, a local shallyan priestess, has recently expressed 
concern  over  the  wellbeing  of  these  urchins,  even  claiming 
that a number of the children have vanished under suspicious 
circumstances, and is looking for help to uncover the truth of 
what’s really happening.

Eilhart 
Known  and  celebrated  by  wine  drinkers  throughout  the  Old 
World,  the  vineyards  around  Eilhart  produce  the  succulent 
grapes, and thus the wine, that shares its name. Eilhart is widely 
considered  one  of  the  Reikland’s  best  white  wines,  valued  not 
just  for  its  crisp,  light  flavour,  but  also  for  its  famously  mild 
hangovers  that  grow  no  worse  no  matter  how  much  of  it  was 
quaffed the night before, or so Eilharters claim. Recently, Eilhart 
has recently also become famed in the Reikland, and as far afield 
as Marienburg, for its sharp, acidic beers making use of fragrant 
hops and local grain.  

Given  the  excellent  quality  of  its  alcoholic  beverages,  Eilhart 
has become a popular destination for riverboat cruises, wherein 

Holthusen 
Nestled  along  the  River  Schilder,  Holthusen  is  a  major  point 
on  the  trade  route  between  Eilhart  and  Marienburg. The  town 
primarily deals in wine and beer, and the barrels in which they are 
stored. The coopers of Holthusen are rightly renowned for their 
sturdy barrels, most famously the Holthusen Hogshead, allegedly 
stout enough to withstand direct cannon fire, while leaving the 
precious  drink  within  unscathed.  The  majority  of  the  vintners 
and brewers of the western Vorbergland use Holthusen barrels; 
indeed, many age their stock here in specialised warehouses sunk 
deep into the ground to keep them cool.

Holthusen  is  enclosed  in  several  rings  of  tall  palisades  and  the 
folk  of  the  town  are  frequently  on  edge,  for  while  few  bandits 
would dare to menace the town, wild Beastmen living deep in the 
nearby Reikwald regularly attack without warning before melting 
back into the forest. Many citizens believe that the creatures have 
an  insatiable  thirst  for  wine,  though  some  fear  blood  is  their 
tipple of choice. Whatever the case, the town has taken to leaving 
barrels of cheap wine at the outskirts of the surrounding forest in 
the hopes the beasts will take their offerings and leave in peace. 
Of course, should any Witch Hunters hear of this appeasement, 
there will likely be a reckoning…

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

the rIme tree
In a clearing a few miles to the north-east of holthusen stands 
a tree unique in all the Reikwald: a magnificent pine locked in 
ice all year round. the rime tree, as it is called, never melts, 
and sends constant flurries of ice and snow cascading down 
onto the frosty undergrowth below. the tree is freezing to the 
touch and even the mightiest axe blows barely crack the thick 
ice coating its bark. 

the site has been claimed by the cult of ulric, and is the 
major terminus for devout ulricans on pilgrimages south of 
the  reik.  For  those  of  an  arcane  bent,  the  perpetually  icy 
bark of the tree has certain useful – and therefore valuable 
– magical properties. But ulricans are rarely happy to have 
wizards poking about their sacred sites, so obtaining some of 
the bark safely is something of a risky endeavour. therefore, 
lord pyromancer schlotter of the Bright order is willing to 
pay good coin for brave men to secure what he cannot.

Kemperbad
An ancient town with a long and convoluted history, the Grand 
Freistadt of Kemperbad is known and celebrated for producing 
the finest brandy in the Reikland. Though part of the Reikland, 
Kemperbad  lies  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Reik;  historically 
the  town  has  been  fought  over,  and  ruled  by,  nobles  from 
Talabecland,  Stirland,  and  the  Reikland,  changing  hands  time 
and again through a series of marriages, treaties, and wars. Since 
gaining  a  charter  affording  it  the  right  to  self-rule  in  1066IC 
from Boris Goldgather, Kemberbad has been a Freistadt led by 
a local council.

Its prime location on the river, coupled with the ability to impose 
and  retain  its  own  taxes,  has  made  the  town  very  rich  indeed. 
Because  of  this,  the  merchants  of  Kemperbad  are  legendarily 
ostentatious, dressing in outfits so gaudy as to shame a peacock, 
and  costly  enough  to  beggar  folk  of  more  modest  means. 
Unsurprisingly,  the  neighbouring  nobility  regard  Kemperbad’s 
coffers with envious eyes, and some send agents to destabilise the 
town. 

Schädelheim
Sitting  near  the  Grootscher  Marsh  at  the  confluence  of  the 
River  Mos  with  the  Reik,  Schädelheim  makes  the  most  it  can 
of its lucrative position on the trade route between Marienburg 
and  Altdorf,  boasting  a  high  number  of  inns  and  berths  for 
passing  ships  and  barges.  Ferries  here  regularly  run  travellers 
back and forth over both rivers, and it is a hub for the disparate 
communities of the nearby marshlands.

Just  south  of  the  centre  of  the  town  lies  an  ancient  temple 
dedicated  to  Morr,  the  God  of  Death.  The  grand,  crumbling 

building has presided over Schädelheim since its infancy, possibly 
even predating the town’s founding. Because of this, many of the 
locals  have  an  especially  strong  affinity  with  Morr,  a  situation 
rarely seen in the Empire outside Ostermark, and highly unusual 
for  the  strongly  Sigmarite  Reikland.  This  is  something  local 
Sigmarites are keen to rectify.

Schilderheim
Standing  proud  at  the  confluence  of  the  Schilder  and  Reik 
rivers,  Schilderheim  is  one  of  the  Reikland’s  most  important 
trading towns. It is also home to a surprisingly diverse array of 
wildfowl, particularly wading birds. Most notable is the red crane, 
a sedentary river bird found predominantly on the Reik that is 
known for using heavy stones to crack open river clams. 

Though  already  a  prosperous  town,  the  Merchants’  Guild  and 
burgomeisters of Schilderheim have grander aspirations, eyeing 
the wealth of Altdorf and Marienburg enviously. Wanting their 
piece  of  this  pie,  the  local  stevedore  guild  has  recently  raised 
its  prices,  a  highly  unpopular  move  that  has  brought  much 
dissatisfaction,  some  of  which  has  spilled  into  the  streets.  To 
avoid  this  extra  fee,  a  number  of  merchants  have  occasionally 
sought  to  bypass  the  stevedores  altogether,  conducting  their 
business  on  the  river  itself,  swapping  not  just  stock,  but  whole 
barges. Merchant houses connected to this practice have recently 
found  wharves  set  alight,  warehouses  raided,  and  barges  sunk; 
of  course, the Stevedores claim  it has  nothing  to  do with  their 
honourable members. The Merchants’ Guild, in turn, is willing to 
pay a lot of money to any who can prove it is.

Stimmigen 
The  major  bridge  over  the  River  Ober,  coupled  with  access 
to the Vorbergland canal system, ensures a great deal of trade 
passes through Stimmigen on its way to Ubersreik, making it 
one  of  the  busiest  market  towns  in  the  Suden  Vorbergland. 
It  is  widely  famed  for  its  lush  orchards,  and  is  the  source  of 
the Reikland’s best known apple, the sweet, yet tart, Ernwald. 
The Ernwald only flourishes in Stimmigen’s environs, proving 
resistant  to  attempts  to  cultivate  it  elsewhere  in  the  Empire. 
In  addition  to  curious  horticulturists  and  jealous  farmers,  the 
Ernwald has attracted a significant Halfling population to the 
area, whose delicious apple pies, pastries and crumbles — not 
to mention crisp cider — can be found in most local hostelries 
all  year  round,  and  especially  during  Pie Week  at  the  start  of 
autumn. This Halfling festival is celebrated by all in Stimmigen, 
an  opportunity  for  rich  and  poor  alike  to  enjoy  tastings  and 
eating  competitions,  and  generally  gorge  themselves  on  all 
manner of sweet, baked goods. 

Ubersreik
The town of Ubersreik is situated near Grey Lady Pass, one of 
only two major passes over the Grey Mountains into Bretonnia. 
Because of this, the town regularly sees traders and travellers from 
across the Old World. The mighty fortress known as the Black 
Rock is connected to the walls of the town should any less welcome 
travellers attempt ingress. Ubersreik has had a long association 

282

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

X

with the nearby Dwarven clans of the Grey Mountains, and in a 
situation unique to Ubersreik, representatives of the city’s Dwarf 
population  sit  on  the  town  council.  One  of  Ubersreik’s  more 
famous edifices, its spectacular bridge over the River Teufel, was 
built by Dwarfs during the time of Magnus the Pious. Widely 
regarded as one of the most impressive feats of engineering to be 
found in the Reikland, it connects the trade road which runs all 
the way from Bögenhafen to Dunkelberg then Nuln. Ubersreik 
deals in trade of all kinds, but is most well-known for ore and the 
skilled metal-work of the Dwarfs.

For exhaustive details on Ubersreik, see the WFRP Starter Set.

Weissbruck
Originally  little  more  than  one  of  many  tiny  fishing  villages 
along  the  River  Bögen,  Weissbruck  has  in  the  past  century 
grown  rapidly  into  a  bustling  port  for  goods  and  travellers 
moving between Bögenhafen and Altdorf. Weissbruck’s change 
in fortune is due to its shrewd rulers, the Grubers, who decided 
to capitalise on the rich deposits of coal and iron found in the 
Skaag Hills. This ready supply of much needed resources enabled 
the Grubers, with the permission and partnership of the Prince 
of Altdorf, to commission Dwarf engineers to construct a canal 
in 2462IC, which rapidly accelerated the town’s growth, bringing 
all manner of citizenry with it. 

While the output of the mines has slowed in recent years, trade 
has  steadily  increased.  Despite  its  rulers’  riches,  Weissbruck 
retains  something  of  the  character  of  a  typical  mining  town; 
burly miners and dockworkers ensure an uneasy peace, and the 
threat of violence is never far removed. As the mines’ output has 
diminished,  more  and  more  miners  have  descended  from  the 

Skaag hills, a growing, agitated, unemployed workforce with little 
to do but drink cheap rotgut and scowl at strangers. 

Wheburg
Wheburg  is  the  first  town  encountered  after  leaving  the  Grey 
Mountains  on  the  road  from  Helmgart  to  Bögenhafen.  Its 
proximity to the fortress of Helmgart ensures troops pass through 
regularly,  and  the  town  offers  a  sizeable  barracks  for  visiting 
soldiers.  Having  survived  the  mountains’  extreme  weather  — 
to  say  nothing  of  ravaging  armies  of  Orcs  and  Goblins,  and 
potential monsters roosting on the nearby Drachenberg — most 
visitors arrive to Wheburg with a powerful desire to celebrate life.

To accommodate that need, Wheburg has become renowned for 
its hospitality, and its locals are widely regarded as the friendliest 
in the Reikland — for a price. The streets are lined with taverns, 
inns,  and  gambling  dens,  not  to  mention  some  less  salubrious 
establishments where all the pleasures of the flesh are purveyed, 
and  illicit  substances  may  be  procured.  Though  fist-fights  and 
petty crime are common, things rarely get too out of hand given 
the  significant  number  of  soldiers  usually  on  hand  to  disperse 
any  rowdy revellers (except, of  course,  when those  revellers  are, 
themselves, off-duty soldiers). Spending time in Wheburg prior 
to marriage has become something of a rite-of-passage for well-
heeled  Reiklanders,  and  it’s  common  to  hear  men  and  women 
calling out, ‘what happens in Wheburg, stays in Wheburg!’ from 
many a street corner.

The BasTions and foRTResses
The  Reikland’s  southern  border  is  dominated  by  the  Grey 
Mountains,  which  are,  in  turn,  dominated  by  a  series  of 

X

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

strongholds, built and rebuilt to defend against raiding Mountain 
Trolls,  Greenskins,  and  the  restless  dead,  not  to  mention  the 
neighbouring kingdom of Bretonnia. 

The River Reik is similarly littered with bastions to ward attack, 
but there most are stony relics of the Empire’s broken past when 
the  Reikland  warred  with  the  other  grand  provinces  and  itself. 
Only  strategic  fortresses  now  remain,  easily  outnumbered  by 
castles fallen to disrepair, their ancient strength and storied past 
all but forgotten, just as their crumbling stonework is lost to time 
and decay. 

Blackstone Tower
While the Axe Bite and Grey Lady passes are the best-known 
routes  over  the  Grey  Mountains,  they  are  not  the  only  ways 
through  the  range.  The  Crooked  Corridor  is  a  narrow  gorge 
through  the  mountains  not  far  from  the  border  with  the 
Wasteland.  It  is  useless  to  most  merchants,  being  far  too  tight 
for wagons or horses, and dangerous to boot as much of the path 
is perched precariously on the edge of steep cliffs, meaning the 
slightest slip of a foot could lead to a painfully inglorious end. 

Completely  impassable  in  the  winter  and  perilous  at  all  other 
times, the Crooked Corridor was known only to goat herders and 
smugglers until a spate of Greenskin raids brought the pass to the 
attention of the authorities. 

Several  decades  ago,  Emperor  Mattheus  II  ordered  the 
construction  of  a  fortress  to  watch  over  the  Crooked  Corridor 
after  repeated  invasion.  Nine  years  later,  Blackstone Tower  was 
completed, drawing its name from the locally quarried dark stone 
that forms its walls, and the slate that tops its towers.  

Its  position  high  above  the  Crooked  Corridor  offered  the 
Emperor’s sharpshooters an excellent perch from which to employ 

their  lethal  skills;  however,  its  status  as  a  Reiklander  bastion 
was short-lived. An oversight at the planning stage resulted in 
the tower being built on lands claimed by the Dwarfs of Karak 
Ziflin. Not wanting to upset the Dwarfs, the Emperor ceded the 
tower, much to the annoyance of the Margrave of Geetburg who 
had helped finance it. 

Today,  the  Dwarfs  ‘generously’  allow  a  limited  garrison  to 
barrack  alongside  their  own  troops  at  Blackstone  Tower,  a 
largely  rebuilt  structure.  With  the  Reiklanders  chafing  under 
the Dwarfs’ leadership, and the Dwarfs constantly belittling the 
shoddy human stonework they’ve yet to replace, the Tower is a 
powderkeg of grievances and resentment, generating a tense — 
and some would say unsustainable — atmosphere. 

Steirlich Manor
On  the  southern  slopes  of  the  Hägercrybs,  in  the  Duchy  of 
Grauwerk,  sits  a  heavily  fortified  manor  atop  a  windswept 
ridge. The manor is ancient, a holding of the von Bruner family, 
and  currently  ruled  by  Graf  Steirlich:  both  the  Graf  and  his 
imposing  manor  were  named  for  a  famous  ancestor  who  was 
gifted the land by Emperor Mandred Ratslayer in 1138IC. 

The Graf is steely eyed and ambitious, with a ruthless streak as 
wide as the Reik. He is well thought of amidst the local smallfolk 
for his determination to root out bandits and hunt down other 
menaces  that  would  dare  impinge  upon  his  property.  Indeed, 
there  are  whisperings  that  he  may  be  a  little  too  willing  to 
investigate unnatural occurrences, for dark rumours of corruption 
swirl around the scions of the von Bruner line. 

Certainly,  the  darkly  handsome  Graf  is  always  on  the  lookout 
for stout hearts, stern wills, and strong sword-arms to help him 
maintain the peace, so few air their fears aloud.

Helmgart 
Set high in the Grey Mountains, the fortress town of Helmgart 
guards the border with Bretonnia from the eastern side of Axe 
Bite Pass. The Empire’s relations with Bretonnia have not always 
been civil, and while the ramparts of Helmgart are no longer lined 
with aging skulls in elaborate helms, they most likely remain in 
the castle’s cellars. These days, the soldiers of Helmgart are more 
often  called  upon  to  patrol  the  pass,  protecting  travellers  and 
merchants from Greenskins, bandits, and other menaces. 

Helmgart’s  keep  was  carved  directly  out  of  the  mountainside 
by  Dwarfs  long  ago. Three  tiers  of  stout  stone  walls  buttress  a 
great granite mountain, dominating the surrounding terrain and 
offering an excellent view of the road below. Adjoining Helmgart 
proper,  is  a  huge,  imposing  wall  broken  only  by  a  single,  long 
tunnel standing between the two, sheer mountainsides: the only 
route  through  to  Bretonnia.    Amongst  the  troops  garrisoning 
the  fortress  are  a  number  of  storied  regiments.  Most  famously, 
the  gunners  of  Mackensen’s  Marauders  –  a  Reiklander  State 
Regiment – are well known for their deadly accuracy, a fearsome 
reputation perhaps aided by the lack of cover on the road below 
the high walls. The fortress sits at one end of the great road that 
leads directly to Bögenhafen, and from there onto Altdorf. 

As  guardian  of  the  principle  trade  route  into  the  Empire  from 
Bretonnia, Helmgart is equal parts imposing citadel and bustling 
trade town. Here, Bretonnian merchants barter brandy, wine, fine 
fabrics, arms, and armour, while their Reiklander counterparts in 
turn funnel their province’s goods south. The local Dwarf clans, 
too,  trade  ingots  of  silver,  lead,  and  iron,  along  with  precious 
pieces  of  Dwarf-smithed  metalwork. With  so  many  merchants 
and traders, the Marketplatz of Helmgart is a bustling place, rife 
with endless opportunities and uncounted thieves.

The Stone
Towering over one of the many islands in the Reik by Essel, the 
massive promontory known simply as The Stone can be seen for 
miles around. A winding path coils up the steep, craggy face from 
the  small,  seemingly  insignificant  jetty  at  its  base  to  the  severe 
walls  of  the  squat  citadel  crowning  the  rocky  mount.  Captains 
give  it  a  wide  berth  when  they  pass,  the  more  superstitious 
among them making an offering of salt and steel to Grandfather 
Reik to safeguard their passage. No pennants fly atop the grim 
battlements, though the occasional gleam from a guard’s helmet 
attests to the troops patrolling the ramparts.

Unknown  to  most,  the  Stone  is  a  secure  prison  containing 
dangerous  criminals  that,  for  various  sensitive,  political  reasons 
cannot  simply  be  executed.  Some  have  powerful  friends  and 
family,  or  are  themselves  nobles  whose  crimes,  if  publicly 
acknowledged would cause scandal and shame to the great and 
good  of  the  Reikland.  Others  are  political  hostages,  held  to 
ensure the compliance of wayward relatives. And, of course, a few 
simply know too much, their precious secrets safeguarded in The 
Stone against their future need. No-one really knows about the 
conditions within The Stone’s walls; no-one really wants to ask. 

The villages, hamleTs, 
and holy plaCes
Throughout  the  Reikland,  most  of  the  uncounted  hundreds  of 
villages and hamlets are clustered close to towns for protection 
and  trade.  By  comparison,  in  the  open  Suden  Vorbergland, 
settlements  are  strewn  more  freely  amongst  the  farmlands, 
dotting  the  landscape  every  few  miles  or  so,  relying  on  the 
protection of fortresses in the mountains and the state regiments 
from  the  large  market  towns.  Due  to  a  quirk  in  Reikland  law 
installed by Sigmarites many centuries  ago,  villages  are  defined 
as any small settlement including a temple of Sigmar; hamlets, 
by comparison, are those without such spiritual support, and are 
often smaller because of this.

Besides  these  smaller  settlements,  the  Reikland  hosts  an 
uncounted number of isolated monasteries, abbeys, way-temples, 
and other holy sites. While most are sited in locations not too far 
from  protection,  some  well-fortified  examples  can  be  found  in 
the most unlikely places, often for religious or historical reasons, 
be that upon the sides of a mountain, the depths of a forest, the 
centre of a lake, or in an even less likely location.

Monastery of the Holy Word 
Deep in the Reikwald west of Altdorf, far from any easily traversed 
road, lies the Monastery of the Holy Word. This hallowed site is 
tended  by  the  Sigmarite  Order  of  the  Anvil. The  Order  of  the 
Anvil is responsible for keeping the laws that govern the Cult of 
Sigmar and maintaining all details of the cult’s practices. 

The  Monastery  of  the  Holy  Word  houses  the  order’s  greatest 
treasure:  the  Testaments  of  Sigmar.  Collected  not  long  after 
Sigmar  abdicated,  the  Testaments  are  a  gathering  of  the 
written  memories  of  warriors  and  citizens  who  knew  Sigmar 
Heldenhammer before he ascended to godhood. Considered to 
be the most accurate collection of the things Sigmar actually said 
and the practices he maintained in life, the Testaments are some 
of the holiest works in the Reikland.

It  is  not  normally  the  practice  of  the  Order  of  the  Anvil  to 
accept  visitors,  but  the  Monastery  of  the  Holy  Word  is  no 
normal  monastery.  Penitents  seeking  obscure  details  about  the 
foundations of Sigmar’s Law will travel from across the Empire 
to query the black and green robed monks on doctrine. 

Nobles and exceedingly wealthy merchants who have repeatedly 
shown their devotion to the Cult of Sigmar will occasionally be 
granted leave to take a pilgrimage to the Monastery of the Holy 
Word. While none are allowed to read the original Testaments, or 
even to touch them, leave to gaze upon one or two of the original 
pages is deemed to be a sacred honour beyond price.

Rottfurt
Scores  of  settlements  line  the  River  Teufel,  most  easily 
forgettable, even interchangeable. Not so Rottfurt, whose name 
is spoken of in hushed, reverential tones by scholars and wizards 
throughout the Empire. Though primarily a village of shepherds, 

285

X

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

producing  wool  and  mutton,  Rottfurt  also  produces  a  famous 
— and famously pricy — sheepskin parchment: Rottfurt Silver. 
The parchment possesses a faint sheen, takes ink well, and resists 
fading far longer than other, lesser parchments. 

on the village for an hour or two at midday, hiding behind the 
surrounding  cliffs  in  the  morning,  and  creeping  behind  the 
mountains as the day lengthens. 

Because  of  this,  the  thick-wooled,  pale  sheep  of  Rottfurt  are 
the  village’s  pride  and  afforded  every  comfort.  They  feed  on 
the  luscious  grass  of  the  nearby  Hammastrat  Heights  and  are 
generally  allowed  to  wander  as  they  will  during  the  day.  The 
shepherds contribute to a rotating militia, tasked with protecting 
their precious flocks at all costs. 

However,  of  late  the  livestock  have  been  going  missing; 
intriguingly, those on guard have always found themselves falling 
asleep, despite their best efforts. On waking, another sheep has 
vanished. What began as a minor frustration has grown to a full-
blown obsession for the locals, with as many wild and spectacular 
theories flying around as there are stars in the heavens. 

Wörlin
The small fishing hamlet of Wörlin is almost impossible to spot 
from  the  river.  The  settlement  is  surrounded  by  a  number  of 
small, rocky islets and promontories, and sheltered by thousands 
of bowing trees. These ‘Willows of Wörlin’ line the banks of the 
Reik for many miles around, and it seems none have any interest 
in  using  their  lumber.  A  great  deal  of  trade  passes  by  Wörlin, 
but very little actually happens in Wörlin as most of the passing 
goods are bound for more lucrative markets. 

the root oF the proBlem
on the festival day of sonnstill, the ‘hamlet circle’ — a council 
of the hamlet’s elders — gather to ‘Water the Willows’. this 
simple ceremony involves singing, dancing, feasting, and the 
slicing of a virile stranger’s throat, splashing blood across the 
thirsty roots of the Queen Willow, quenching her sanguinary 
appetites for one more year. 

should  the  ceremony  be  completed,  the  Queen  is  pleased, 
and will ensure the hamlet’s safety from the children of the 
forest. should the ceremony be interrupted, the Queen awakes 
and  summons  her  children,  bringing  braying  Beastmen  by 
the score to slaughter all in their path. But outsiders rarely 
consider such consequences when they have a knife to their 
throat.

Zahnstadt
Isolated Zahnstadt is considered by locals to be the ‘last village 
of the Vorbergland’, after which the rolling hills turn barren and 
cold  before  reaching  upwards  to  the  Greenskin-infested  Grey 
Mountains. In the shadow of those peaks, Zahnstadt skulks along 
the southern bank of the River Mos, deep in a dark valley with 
bleak  crags  rising  to  all  sides.  In  summer,  the  sun  only  shines 

In  the  winter,  there  is  no  direct  sunlight  at  all,  locking  the 
village in a gloomy cycle of twilight and darkness. Despite this, 
the folk of Zahnstadt are famous for their bright dispositions 
and  perpetual  cheerfulness,  a  trait  outsiders  often  find  forced 
and off-putting. Every house in Zahnstadt is brightly painted in 
a garish medley of different, often clashing colours. Its homely 
inn, the Wayward Sun, is famous for its ever-burning hearthfire 
and for the relentlessly cheerful songs that echo long into the 
night.

the sIns oF the past
Zahnstadt  has  long  been  in  the  grip  of  something  far  worse 
than a lack of enriching sunlight: vampires. near the end of the 
third vampire Wars, Janos von carstein deserted the vampire 
lord mannfred von carstein’s depleted armies. after weeks of 
evading pursuit from his master’s vengeful minions, he chanced 
upon dark Zahnstadt and realised it was the perfect place to go 
to ground. almost three-hundred years later, and he hides there 
still, and time has made him bold. he now sleeps beneath the 
Wayward Sun in an ostentatious, velvet-lined coffin, rising each 
evening to hold ‘court’ in the inn, forcing enthralled locals to 
sing happy songs of his homeland sylvania. 

rumour of this has not only reached the ears of Witch hunters, 
but  also  the  pawns  of  recently  resurrected  mannfred  von 
carstein, who has ordered his traitorous son be brought before 
him. It would be unfortunate, indeed, should poor, unsuspecting 
souls happen to hostel in the Wayward sun on the same night 
the Witch hunters arrive to investigate, and the same night that 
mannfred’s  agents  choose  to  extract  Janos  before  the  Witch 
hunters uncover his true nature…

the Ancient SiteS 
And teRRible RuinS

The  Reikland’s  long  and  bloody  history  stretches  back  long 
before the time of Magnus the Pious and the Great War Against 
Chaos;  relics  of  ancient  atrocities  litter  the  realm,  and  it  is  a 
wise and  wary traveller  that checks for  ancient  standing  stones 
before erecting their camp of an evening. Some of these sites bear 
haunting  legends  of  gruesome  renown  and  macabre  spectacle, 
but  most  towns  and  villages  boast  their  own  local  ruins,  with 
accompanying tales of horror and bloodshed. 

The Darkstone Ring
The wise do not venture to the Darkstone Ring. The path to this 
place of terrible and ancient power lies to the north of Blutroch 

286

G l o r I o u s   r e I K l a n d

X

near  the  Altdorf-Bögenhafen  road.  When  night  falls,  the  six 
suggestively-carved  stones  glow  green  with  a  wan  luminosity, 
flaring bright as Morrslieb waxes. 

At  the  centre  of  the  Darkstone  Ring  lies  a  monolithic  slab  of 
unidentifiable  rock,  permanently  stained  with  the  blood  of  the 
countless innocents sacrificed there down through the millennia. 

Despite  the  ring’s  fell  reputation,  travellers  seem  drawn  to  its 
malevolent environs, lured by legends of mystical potential and 
lost artefacts of terrible arcane power. Not even frequent sightings 
of beastmen and cultists — especially around Geheimnisnacht — 
can deter these brave, some may say foolhardy, souls. 

Castle Drachenfels 
Like the twisted talon of a malformed claw, the seven towers of 
Castle Drachenfels clutch at the sky in a gesture of malevolence 
and  spite.  Each  of  its  misshapen  turrets  is  festooned  with 
windows, resembling eyes without number, alert to the arrival of 
any traveller unlucky — or unwise — enough to stumble upon 
the lair of the Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels. 

Drachenfels  —  a  mythically  powerful  sorcerer,  necromancer, 
and daemonologist — has tormented mankind since before the 
time  of  the  Empire;  already  ancient  when  he  suffered  his  first 
great  defeat  at  the  hands  of  Sigmar  Heldenhammer,  he  has 
returned  time  and  again  to  his  haunt  in  the  Grey  Mountains, 
like a festering wound that refuses to heal. Rumours abound that 
the seemingly quiescent ruins, mostly reduced to rubble and long 
forsaken, are less abandoned than they appear…

Helspire 
Looming perilously in the peaks overlooking Axe-Bite Pass, the 
Helspire is a grim fortress, carved directly out of the living rock of 
the Grey Mountains and inlaid with the bones of countless fallen. 
It appears long abandoned and as still as the grave; yet, on rare 
nights of occult significance, eldritch lights can be seen blazing 
along its battlements, casting eerie shadows across the pass, even 
in  the  blackest  of  nights.  On  such  nights,  the  Helspire  reveals 
itself as a citadel of the unquiet dead, and skeletal knights charge 
forth,  scouring  the  mountainside,  terrorising  both  Reiklanders 
and  Bretonnian  alike.  Little  is  known  about  the  castle,  and 
none  living  claim  to  have  pierced  its  bleak  walls  or  know  who 

commands the legions of the undead that lurk therein. Some say 
a cabal of necromancers call it home, others whisper it is the vault 
of a vampire, and a few even murmur the fortress is commanded 
by  a  powerful  Liche,  in  life  a  powerful  sorcerer,  clinging  to 
undeath in the pursuit of bloody vengeance for some centuries-
old  slight.  Perhaps  because  of  this  uncertainty,  the  Helspire  is 
said to be filled with riches looted from across the Old World, 
but none know the truth, as those who seek such treasures never 
return or never talk.

The Lorlay
Possessing  a  breathtaking  vista,  the  Lorlay  is  an  imposing 
rock  formation  standing  proud  in  the  centre  of  the  Reik  some 
40  miles  downstream  of  Grissenwald.  The  channels  on  either 
side  of  the  jutting  island  flow  swift  and  deep,  and  despite  the 
relative narrowness of the river at this point, no crossing has been 
successfully constructed. 

Romantic  legends  abound  of  a  beautiful,  elven  maiden,  pale  of 
skin  and  supple  of  limb,  who  swims  in  the  fast-moving  waters 
at dawn and dusk. Because of this, the Lorlay is popular spot for 
affluent Reiklanders’ to hold Taalite stag parties before marriage, 
and a surprising number of high-class inns can be found nearby. 
Tales  of  the  singing  water  maiden  are  especially  rife  amongst 
the Reikland’s river-bound sailors, and if their stories are to be 
believed, she has been spotted by half the seamen of the navy.

The Singing Stones
West of Schädelheim, deep in a wooded valley, stands an ancient 
dolmen.  Its  stones  are  old  beyond  reckoning,  arrayed  in  a 
spiralling  pattern  around  a  central  arrangement  of  huge  pillars 
capped with an enormous slab, resembling nothing more than a 
titanic altar. From the ground it is nigh on impossible to discern 
the intricate pattern of the stones, especially given the trees and 
bushes that have grown in amongst the menhirs. 

When a westerly wind blows up the valley, in from the Wasteland, 
the stones produce an eerie keening that echoes for miles around. 
While  some  locals  claim  listening  to  the  stones’  song  can  give 
insight  into  problems  or  grant  strange  wisdom,  others  declare 
such nonsense is heresy, knowing nothing but trouble comes from 
trafficking in such ungodly power, and are more than willing to 
use violence to save the souls of the foolish.

‘after sixty years in the trade, here are the three most important lessons

The  trappings  you  receive  from  your  Class  and  Career  (see 
Chapter  2:  Character)  are  enough  to  get  you  started,  but  you 
may want more equipment. During character creation, additional 
items  can  be  purchased  from  the  lists  in  this  chapter  without 
restriction.  However,  once  you  start  to  play,  the  availability  of 
some trappings is limited, so make sure you buy everything you 
want and can afford before you begin play.

suspicious eye. 

Standard coin values are:
1 gold crown (1GC) = 20 silver shillings (20/–) = 240 
brass pennies (240d)

1 silver shilling (1/–) = 12 brass pennies (12d)

This is usually abbreviated to:
1 GC = 20/– = 240d

money

Before you can buy new trappings, you first need to understand 
how money works in the Empire.

The  Empire’s  coins  are  most  commonly  minted 
in  3 
denominations: Brass Pennies (d), Silver Shillings (/), and Gold 
Crowns (GC). Coins usually weigh around an ounce and, as their 
inherent  value  is  determined  by  weight,  even  foreign  coins  can 

288

money, money, money
For those new to WFRP, remembering there are 12 pennies 
in a shilling and 20 shillings in 1 crown, for a total of 240 
pennies to 1 crown, can take some getting used to, especially 
if  the  money  is  mixed  up  a  little,  such  as  this:  6/8,  or 
6  shillings  and  8  pence.  that  number  may  initially  look 
arbitrary,  but  if  you  translate  it  to  pennies,  it  becomes  a 
far more understandable 80d, or one third of a gold crown. 
Indeed, an 80d coin is fairly common in the empire, and is 
called a noble.

don’t worry too much about fully understanding the coins to 
begin with. an easy way to keep everything right in your head 
is to translate all prices to pennies and think of it in your 
local currency to get a grip of the numbers. so, if British, 
you could think of a brass penny as £1, a silver coin as worth 
around £12, and a crown as £240. It’s not accurate, but does 
help keep the money understandable until you are used to it. 
so, if someone offered you a job for 10 shillings, think of it 
as £120, which is a fair bit of money. But if someone offered 
you a job for 10GC, that’s a far more tempting £2400!

The CosT of living
As  they  wander  the  Empire,  adventurers  likely  fill  their  purses 
with  coins  of  all  three  denominations,  perhaps  poor  one  day, 
unexpectedly rich the next. However, outside adventuring, most 
lives centre on a single coin type as determined by Social Status 
(see page 49). 

Those  seeking  to  maintain  their  Status  must  also  keep  up 
appearances.  After  all,  if  you  repeatedly  appear  as  poorer  than 
you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor. In practice, 
dressing  and  eating  as  expected,  and  using  trappings  that  are 
fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept 
you at face value. What this requires in practice is left up to the 
GM to determine, using the following as a guide:

•	

•	

Brass  Tier:  The  poorest  members  of  society  are  unlikely 
to see a gold coin in their lifetimes. They live humble lives, 
subsisting  on  plain  foods  and  sleeping  in  shared  rooms, 
and  have  little  appearances  to  maintain.  Indeed,  peers  are 
more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for 
spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are 
likely to note spending too little.

Silver Tier: The  swelling  middle-classes  may  use  pennies 
for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their 
standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, 
and wear good quality clothing.

•	 Gold Tier: The  wealthiest  elites  rarely  bother  themselves 
with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, 
and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive 
garb and trappings.

For  GMs  preferring  hard  numbers,  spending  around  half  your 
Status  every  day  is  usually  enough  to  maintain  appearances, 
though you may be living a little frugally. So, if you have a Status 
of Silver 4, spending at least 2 shillings per day will do for food 
and board, where if you have Brass 2 Status, you need only spend 
a pfennig a day.

CRiminal Coinage
Of course, if there is money involved there will be folk looking to 
take any advantage they can, including criminal options. For the 
Rogues  in  your  party,  two  schemes  concerning  coins  are  worth 
knowing.

Counterfeiting
The  diversity  of  coinage  circulating  the  Empire  means 
counterfeiting is rife. Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing 
coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. 
A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically 
by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.

Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires 
an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then 
a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the 
aid  of  an  assistant.  Including  a  higher  precious  metal  content 
makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using 
less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.

Clipping
Embezzlers  can  trim  slivers  of  precious  metal  away  from  the 
edges  of  coins. This  scam  is  called ‘clipping’  or ‘shaving’  and  is 
practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access 
to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings 
are  then  melted  down  and  sold  to  jewellers,  counterfeiters,  or 
fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the 
more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test. 

money slanG
various  slang  terms  are  used  for  coins  across  the  empire. 
here are some of the more common terms.

•	 gold crowns: marks, Karls, Gelt
•	 Silver Shillings: Bob, shimmies, mucks
•	 brass Pennies: pfennigs, clanks, shrapnel

the nuln standard
altdorf  may  be  the  current  capital  of  reikland  and  the 
empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state 
of  nuln  to  the  south.  historically,  nuln  was  the  empire’s 
capital until house holswig-schliestein restored the throne to 
altdorf a century ago, and many imperial institutions still call 
that city home. the nuln standard only governs coin weight 
and metallurgy, not stamp imagery, which varies significantly 
across the provinces.

GoinG to MarketOnce you start play, the availability of rarer goods is restricted. After all, it’s hard to find a harpsichord in a five-house hamlet, but not so hard in the shops and markets of imperial capital, Altdorf.The following rules for buying and selling are all optional. The GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM simply states what is or isn’t purchasable. Equally, the GM may prefer you to simply check the trapping lists, roll for Availability and, if the Test succeeds, spend the coin on whatever you want. Possibly without even Haggling!OptiOns: tracking MOneyWhere some groups like to track every penny closely, perhaps even using chits or fantasy coins to represent in-game coins, others prefer to ignore all fiscal book-keeping. The game rules assume you are counting every coin, but if you wish to simplify money, you can do so using your Status. If an item costs less than your status level — so if you have a status of silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item. Beyond that, you can buy a maximum of one item a day that costs more with a Haggle Test, with the difficulty set by the GM according to the cost of the item and the local markets.AvAilAbilityAll Trappings have an Availability, either Common, Scarce, Rare, or Exotic. Common items are found in almost every corner of the Empire and are always assumed to be readily available. Scarce and Rare items are less common, and you need to pass an Availability Test to find any locally in stock; the chance of passing the Test depends upon the settlement size. Exotic items are super rare, and only available if the GM says so, or if you commission the item from an appropriate artisan (perhaps with a Commission Endeavour, see page 197), or make it yourself (perhaps with a Crafting Endeavour see page 197).Once you know an item’s Availability, check it on the following table to see if it is in stock.VillageTownCityCommonIn Stock!In Stock!In Stock!Scarce30%60%90%Rare15%30%45%ExoticNot in StockNot in StockNot in StockIf you fail an Availability Test for Scarce or Rare items, you can either reroll when you arrive at a new settlement or you can try again next week if the settlement is Town-size or larger.If an item is in stock, it’s up to the GM to determine how many are available. As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have 1d10 items, and cities have as many t h e   c o n s u m e r s ’   G u I d e

as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).Bargaining and TradingPeople of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item (see Craftsmanship below). Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the Dealmaker Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.Roleplaying Shopping TripsTrips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:•	The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.•	Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20% if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.SellingSelling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.Lowering the PriceIf you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.Example: Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.BarTeringRural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.Bartering ratiosTraded ItemsAcquired ItemsCommonScarceRareExoticCommon1:12:14:18:1Scarce1:21:12:14:1Rare1:41:21:12:1Exotic1:81:41:21:1CraftsmanshipThe items available in the shops, stalls, and merchant halls of the Empire vary significantly in quality. Not everything is made equal, and the Craftsmanship rules reflect this using Item Qualities, and Item Flaws.An Item Quality makes the trapping a little better, but harder to find. An Item Flaw makes the trapping a little worse, but easier to find.XI

iTem QUaliTies
A  Trapping  is  called  a  Quality  Trapping  if  it  has  more  Item 
Qualities than Flaws. For each Item Quality the Trapping has, 
double its price and make it one step less available. A Trapping 
with  more  Qualities  than  its  Encumbrance,  and  that  lacks  any 
Flaws, is called a Best Quality Trapping.

Example: A spade that has the Fine and Durable Item Qualities 
costs  quadruple  the  list  price,  and  drops  availability  from 
Common to Rare.

Lightweight
Cleverly  crafted  for  ease  of  carrying.  Reduce  Encumbrance 
points by 1.

Practical
Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item 
receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armour, any penalties for 
wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from −30 to −20).

optIons: craFtInG GuIlds
most  artisans  in  the  empire  are  members  of  guilds  that 
protect  their  rights  and  ensure  appropriate  standards  of 
craftsmanship.  If  a  town  or  city  contains  a  crafting  guild, 
related goods of poor quality are rarely available. 

If the Gm states you are shopping in a town with relevant 
crafting guilds, each item Flaw reduces availability instead of 
increasing  it.  Furthermore,  the  first  Item  Quality  does  not 
reduce Availability. Prices are still modified as per usual.

iTem flaws
A Trapping is called a Flawed Trapping if it has more Item Flaws 
than Qualities. Each Flaw halves the listed price and improves 
Availability  by  one  step.  Many  vendors  sell  flawed  items,  but 
pretend  they  are  anything  but.  A  successful  Test  with  any 
appropriate skill — such as Evaluate, or Melee for weapons, or 
Trade for tools — will spot such underhanded activities.

Note:  Exotic  items  do  not  have  their  Availability  modified  by 
being  Flawed  —  they  are  always  difficult  to  find,  even  shoddy 
examples.

Example: A suit of chainmail that is both Bulky and Unreliable 
costs a quarter of the list price, and raises Availability from Rare 
to Common.

Ugly
Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items 
attract  negative  attention,  and  related  Fellowship  Tests  might 
even suffer a –10 penalty.

Shoddy
Hastily  crafted  by  an  amateur  or  fraudster.  The  item  breaks 
when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy 
armour breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location 
it protects.

Durable
Laboriously  crafted  using  strong  materials,  the  item  can  take 
+Durable  Damage  points  before  it  suffers  any  negatives  (see 
Weapon Damage and Armour Damage on pages 296 and 299) 
and  gains  a  saving  throw  of  9+  on  a  1d10  roll  against  instant 
breakage  from  sources  like  Trap  Blade  (see  page  298).  This 
Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the 
saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).

Example: Molli owns a high quality sword with Durable 3, 
meaning it can take 3 Damage before suffering any negatives, 
and has a saving throw of 7+ against breaking. 

Fine
Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of 
social  status  and  can  be  taken  multiple  times.  The  higher  the 
quality, the more impressive it seems.

UnreliableCrafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armour are doubled.BulkyAn awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this flaw). Bulky clothing and armour are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for armour are doubled.EncumbrancEEven the doughtiest Dwarf cannot carry a limitless number of trappings. To help you track how much you are carrying, all items are marked as weighing a number of Encumbrance points (sometimes abbreviated to ‘Enc’), typically from 0–3, where 0 shows a trifling item that’s easily carried, and 3 represents something that’s a struggle to heft.The number of Encumbrance points you can carry without penalty is determined by your Strength Bonus + Toughness Bonus. Thus, average humans begin play able to carry around 6 Encumbrance points. EncumbrancE ExamplEsEncExample Trappings0Knives, Coins, Jewelry1Sword, Mandolin, Sling Bag2Greatsword, Tent, Backpack3Halberd, Cask, Large Sack Small ItemSCommon sense usually dictates the number of smaller items someone can carry before becoming Encumbered. To provide a rough guide, money weighs 1 Encumbrance point per 200 coins.Over-SIzed ItemSCertain large items weigh 4 or more Encumbrance points, such as barrels or saddlebags. You may normally only carry one oversized object, and it likely requires both hands.BeaStS Of BurdenDraft animals ignore the standard Strength Bonus + Toughness Bonus formula for Encumbrance points. Encumbrance points for mules, horses, carts and wagons are listed in their descriptions. Each Human-sized passenger is assumed to weigh around 10 Encumbrance points, modified by the GM as necessary.WOrn ItemSWorn items such as armour, clothing, and jewellery all have their Encumbrance dropped by 1, which often means they count as Encumbrance 0 when worn.OverBurdenedCharacters who exceed their Encumbrance capacity may be slowed, and will become fatigued by travel. Movement reduction and Travel Fatigue incurred from Encumbrance stacks with any Armour penalties. Further, whenever you have to take a Fatigued Condition when Overburdened for a reason other than being Overburdened, gain an extra +1.EncPenaltyUp to limitNo penaltiesUp to double limit–1 Movement (min: 3), –10 Agility, +1 Travel FatigueUp to triple limit–2 Movement (min: 2), –20 Agility (min: 10), +2 Travel FatigueMore than 3×You’re not moving.Encumbrance and AttributesMovement penalties for Encumbrance are applied immediately and can only be removed by dropping equipment.Encumbrance and Travel FatigueFatigued Conditions are accrued at the end of a day’s travel and can only be removed with a long rest.WEaponsWeapons used across the Empire vary according to provincial preference, religious requirement, individual inclination, and trusty old tradition.

hand Weapons
‘hand Weapon’ is used to describe any of a number of basic 
weapons that, though different, are assumed to be effectively 
the  same  in-game,  including  swords,  axes,  hammers,  maces, 
short spears, and more.

BlacKpoWder ammunItIon
Blunderbusses are the only weapons listed that use the small 
shot or Improvised shot ammunition. all other Blackpowder 
and engineering weapons use bullets.

weapon damage
Some Fumble results (see page 160) or spells may damage your 
weapon. For each point of damage your weapon receives, reduce 
its Damage by –1. If the Damage is reduced to +0 (or SB +0), the 
weapon is mangled beyond all recognition, and now counts as an 
Improvised Weapon. If an Improvised Weapon is Damaged, it is 
considered useless for melee combat.

Weapons  can  be  fixed  by  appropriate  Artisans  for  10%  of  the 
weapon’s cost per damage point sustained. Weapons reduced to 
Improvised Weapons  cannot  be  fixed. You  can  also  repair  your 
own weapons if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools 
and, for more than a single point of Damage, a Workshop.

melee weapon gRoUps
All  melee  weapons  are  assigned  to  a  Weapon  Group.  Each 
Weapon  Group  requires  a  separate  skill  to  master  its  use.    So, 
Melee (Flail) allows you to use Flails and is a separate skill from 
Melee (Polearm), which allows you to use Polearms. If you use 
a weapon from a Group where you have no Advances, you Test 
your Weapon Skill to hit with the weapon. While you still suffer 
all the weapon’s Flaws, you cannot use any of its Qualities. Some 
Melee Weapon Groups also have special rules.

Cavalry
Cavalry weapons are assumed to be used when mounted. When 
not used from horse-back, all two-handed weapons in the Cavalry 
Weapon  Group  also  count  as  Two-Handed  weapons.  Single-
handed Cavalry weapons are not normally used when unmounted.

Flail
Unskilled characters add the Dangerous Weapon Flaw to their 
Flails, and the other listed Weapon Qualities are not used.

Parry
Any one-handed weapon with the Defensive Quality can be used 
with Melee (Parry). When using Melee (Parry), a weapon can be 
used to Oppose an incoming attack without the normal –20 off-
hand penalty (see page 161).

The winner chooses if combat continues as normal or as ‘in-fighting’. During in-fighting, any weapon longer than Short counts as an Improvised weapon.Ranged Weapon gRoupsRanged weapons are difficult to master. You cannot attempt a Ranged Test for a weapon you do not have the correct speciality for. So, if you know Ranged (Blackpowder), you cannot attempt a Ranged (Bow) Test. However, there are a few exceptions.Blackpowder	and	ExplosivesThose with Ranged (Engineering) can use Blackpowder and Explosive weapons without penalty.Crossbows	and	ThrowingCrossbows and Thrown weapons are relatively simple to use. You can attempt a Ranged (Crossbow) or Ranged (Throwing) Test using your Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all Qualities whilst retaining its Flaws.EngineeringAll Engineering weapons can be used by characters with Ranged (Blackpowder), but the weapons lose all Weapon Qualities whilst retaining their flaws.Weapon RangeA weapon’s range is its medium range in yards. Chapter	5:	Rules	presents modifiers if a weapon is at Point Blank, Short, Long, or Extreme range. Calculate ranges as follows:CaLCuLating Range BandsPoint Blank = Range ÷ 10Short = Range ÷ 2Long = Range x 2Extreme = Range x 3sampLe WeapOn RangesWeaponPoint	BlankShortMedLongEx-tremeBow52550100150Heavy Crossbow1050100200300Pistol210204060Sling63060120180Weapon QualitiesSome weapons have specific advantages over others, which are described with Weapon Qualities.AccurateThe weapon is accurate and easy to hit with. Gain a bonus of +10 to any Test when firing this weapon.BlackpowderThe crack of gunfire followed by gouts of smoke and confusion can be terrifying. If you are targeted by a Blackpowder weapon, you must pass an Average	(+20)	Cool Test or take a Broken Condition, even if the shot misses.Blast	(Rating)All Characters within (Rating) yards of the struck target point take SL+Weapon Damage, and suffer any Conditions the weapon inflicts.DamagingA Damaging weapon can use the higher score from either the units die or the SL to determine the Damage caused from a successful hit. For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test XI

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

and  the  target  number  was  52  you  can  choose  to  use  the  SL, 
which  in  this  case  is  2,  or  the  units  die  result,  which  is  4.  An 
Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging 
takes precedent).

Defensive
Defensive weapons are designed to parry incoming attacks. If you 
are wielding such a weapon, gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Melee 
Test when you oppose an incoming attack.

Distract
Distracting weapons can be used to drive an opponent back due to 
their dangerous or whip-like natures. Instead of causing Damage, a 
successful attack with a Distracting weapon can force an opponent 
back 1 yard per SL by which you win the Opposed Test.

Entangle
Your  weapon  wraps  around  your  opponents,  entangling 
them.  Any  opponent  successfully  hit  by  your  weapon  gains 
the Entangled  Condition  with  a  Strength  value  equal  to  your 
Strength  Characteristic.  When  Entangling  an  opponent, 
you  cannot  otherwise  use  the  weapon  to  hit.  You  can  end  the 
Entangling whenever you wish.

Fast
Fast  weapons  are  designed  to  strike  out  with  such  speed  that 
parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before 
they can react. A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack 
with  the  Fast  weapon  outside  of  the  normal  Initiative  sequence, 
either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. 

Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a 
penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the 
Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with 
Fast  weapons  fight  in  Initiative  order  (relative  to  each  other) 
as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes 
precedent).

Hack
Hacking  weapons  have  heavy  blades  that  can  hack  through 
armour with horrific ease. If you hit an opponent, you Damage a 
struck piece of armour or shield by 1 point as well as wounding 
the target.

Impact
Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their 
weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units 
die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. 
An  Undamaging  weapon  can  never  also  have  Impact 
(Undamaging takes precedent).

Impale
Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons 
cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, 
etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under 
an appropriate Test in combat. 

If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used 
has  firmly  lodged  itself  in  the  target’s  body.  Arrows  and  bolts 
require  a  successful  Challenging  (+0)  Heal Test  to  remove  — 
bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery  Talent in Chapter 4: 
Skills and Talents). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each 
unremoved arrow or bullet.

Penetrating
The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour. Non-metal 
APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored.

Pistol
You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat.

Precise
The weapon is easy to get on target. Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any 
successful Test when attacking with this weapon.

Pummel
Pummel  weapons  are  especially  good  at  battering  foes  into 
submission.  If  you  score  a  Head  hit  with  a  Pummel  weapon, 
attempt  an  Opposed  Strength/  Endurance  test  against  the 
struck  opponent.  If  you  win  the  test,  your  opponent  gains  a 
Stunned Condition.

Repeater (Rating)
Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after 
each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully 
reload the weapon using the normal rules.

Shield (Rating)
If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count 
as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. 
If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 
or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your 
Line of Sight.

Trap Blade
Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes 
even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against 
an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead 
of causing a Critical Hit.

If  you  choose  to  do  this,  enact  an  Opposed  Strength  Test, 
adding  your  SL  from  the  previous  Melee Test.  If  you  succeed, 
your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score 
an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but 
the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the 
Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the 
blade and may fight on as normal.

Unbreakable
The  weapon  is  exquisitely  well-made  or  constructed  from  an 
especially  strong  material.  Under  almost  all  circumstances,  this 
weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.

298

t h e   c o n s u m e r s ’   G u I d e

XI

Wrap
Wrap  weapons  typically  have  long  chains  with  weights  at  the 
end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests 
opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, 
as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.

Undamaging
Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs 
are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not 
automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit 
in combat.

weapon flaws
Some  weapons  are  just  difficult  to  use,  or  simply  dangerous,  as 
described with Weapon Flaws.

Dangerous
Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent. 
Any failed test including an 9 on either 10s or units die results in 
a Fumble (see Chapter 5: Rules for more on Fumbles).

Imprecise
Imprecise  weapons  are  difficult  to  bring  to  bear  as  they  are 
unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using 
the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise 
(Imprecise takes precedent).

ARmouR

First off, avoid all contact. that’s yer basic principle. and in case you 
can’t, always wear protection. … What?’

– corporal ‘nobbs’ nobbilar, Basic combat Instructor. 

Armour is listed in the following format:

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	

Armour Type: Each armour is listed by the material its 
constructed from, in order of protective effectiveness.
Price: The price to buy an average piece of the armour.
Enc: The Encumbrance for the armour.
Availability: The Availability of the armour.
Penalty: Any penalty for wearing that specific piece of 
Armour in addition to Encumbrance (Page 293). Note: 
Some armour brings a penalty if you wear any of it, such as 
wearing any chain brings a penalty of –10 Stealth.
Locations: The Hit Locations the Armour protects.
APs: The number of Armour Points the armour provides 
to the protected Hit Locations.

•	 Qualities and Flaws: Any Armour Qualities or Flaws the 

armour may possess.

aRmoUR damage
As blows rains down on your armour, it can be damaged, possibly 
permanently. Whenever you are instructed to damage a piece of 
armour, the APs in the location damaged are reduced by 1. 

If this lowers the APs to 0 in that location, the armour there is 
rendered useless.

Reload (Rating)
The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw 
requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon 
Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while 
reloading, you must start again from scratch.

Armour is generally damaged in one of two ways: 

1.  A special ability triggers, such as a spell or Talent, 

damaging a piece of armour

2.  A Critical Wound is deflected

Slow
Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to 
use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in 
a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a 
bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attacks.

Critical Deflection
This only occurs should you choose it to. If you suffer a Critical 
Wound  from  an  incoming  attack  on  a  location  protected  by 
armour, you can choose to let your armour be damaged by 1AP in 
order to ignore the Critical Wound. 

Tiring
The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You 
only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits 
on a Turn you Charge.

You still suffer all normal Wounds (and given your APs are now 
1 point lower, you probably suffer an extra Wound), but you avoid 
the Critical Wound effects as the blow is absorbed by your now-
damaged armour.

XI

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Repairing Armour
It costs 10% of the armour’s base price per AP lost to repair it. 
So, if you had a Sleeved Chainmail Coat with 1AP of damage on 
the Body, and 1AP of damage on the Arms, it will cost you 20% 
of your armour’s base cost to fix it, in this case 12/–. If a section 
of your armour is completely broken, it will cost you 30% of the 
armour’s base cost to fix, and you’ll likely be waiting some time 
before it’s completed. 

Impenetrable
The armour is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply 
cannot  penetrate  it.  All  Critical  Wounds  caused  by  an  odd 
number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.

Armour Flaws
Some armours have points of weakness, as described by Armour 
Flaws.

You can also repair your own armour if you have the appropriate 
Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for Plate Armour, a Workshop.

aRmoUR QUaliTies
Armour can possess the following Armour Qualities:

Flexible
Flexible  armour  can  be  worn  under  a  layer  of  non-Flexible 
armour if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.

Partial
The armour does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent 
that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores 
the partial armour’s APs.

Weakpoints
The armour has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your 
opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a 
weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of 
your armour are ignored.

Packs and containersTrappings can be packed into backpacks, sacks, and pouches, making them easier to carry. The table shows the Encumbrance value for carrying a pack or other container (Enc), and the number of Encumbrance the container can carry (Carries). You only count the Enc value to determine the number of Encumbrance points carried.

Clothing and aCCessoriesClothing styles in the Empire vary considerably. As a general guideline, commoners wear simple tunics with breeches or gowns. Middle-class citizens favour puff-and-slash fashions with hats and hosiery or dresses. The elites flaunt capes, furs, and flamboyant hats with extravagantly enormous feathers – the more exotic the better!

Servants also wear courtly garb to banquets and ceremonies, although their surcoats and corsets are less ostentatious than the nobles’ fashions and can therefore be purchased at half price.Hat: Fine quality hats are status symbols in the Empire’s towns and cities. The more flamboyant the hat, the better.Jewellery: Prices vary by craftsmanship, metal type, and gem value. As a general guideline, common rings without any gemstones cost 10 coins equal to their metal type (i.e. brass, silver or gold) whereas necklaces cost 20 coins of the same metal type.Sceptre: The highest-ranking legal officials carry sceptres to indicate their status.Signet Ring: Gold rings with engraved stamps are worn by nobles and guild officials, who use them to imprint heraldry or insignia into sealing wax.Walking Cane: Polished wooden canes with metal caps are status symbols amongst wealthier townsfolk.Food, drink, and lodgingPoor quality room and board costs half the listed price, and fine quality costs double the listed price.

toolS And kitS

The majority of tools count as Improvised Weapons when used 
in combat, however GMs may rule that heavy or sharp tools (e.g. 
crowbars  and  sickles)  count  as  Hand  Weapons.  Many  of  the 
individual tools listed here are included in Trade Tool packages 
and Workshops, and need not be bought separately.

Animal Trap:  Used  to  catch  game  (see  Gathering  Food  and 
Herbs on page 127).

Antitoxin Kit: Contains a small knife, herbs, and a jar of leeches. 
A successful Heal Test with an antitoxin kit removes all Poisoned 
Conditions. Treatment takes at least two Rounds.

Disguise Kit: Contains enough props for four disguises (e.g. wigs 
and make-up) and also materials for changing your appearance 
used  by  those  with  the  Entertain  (Acting)  Skill  (e.g.  wax,  fake 
blood, and prosthetics).

Fish Hooks: Can be used to catch fish (see Gathering Food and 
Herbs on page 127).

Lock  Picks:  An  assortment  of  small,  variously-shaped  tools 
needed to use the Pick Lock Skill without penalty.

Manacles: Prisoners trying to break out of manacles suffer 1 Wound and must pass a Very Hard (-30) Strength Test.Pole: A long pole used for barging; counts as an Improvised Weapon.Reading Lens: Glass lenses with handles provide a +20 bonus to Read/Write Tests for deciphering tiny or unintelligible writing. Perception Tests to search for fine details such as secret doors or compartments also receive a +20 bonus.Writing Kit: Contains a quill pen, inkpot, and ink blotter.Books and documentsThe printing press is a recent invention in the Empire, so most books are still hand-written, some with pages adorned with exquisite illuminations, others little better than scribbled notes. In larger settlements, official documents, newssheets, and leaflets are typically press-printed, as are many poems, romances, and important academic texts. All prices are loose suggestions only, as contents and quality vary significantly.ItemCostEncAvailabilityBook, Apothecary8GC1ScarceBook, Art5GC1ScarceBook, Cryptography8GC1ExoticBook, Engineer3GC1ScarceBook, Law15GC1RareBook, Magic20GC1ExoticBook, Medicine15GC1RareBook, Religion1GC1CommonGuild LicenseN/A0N/ALeaflet1/–0CommonLegal Document3/–0CommonMap3GC0ScarceParchment/sheet1/–0CommonBook, Apothecary: Apothecary books are usually hand-written. A basic apothecary book contains ingredient descriptions and diagrammed instructions for brewing processes. Formulas for Digestive Tonics, Healing Draughts, and Vitality Draughts are usually included (see Herbs & Draughts). Advanced texts contain formulas for more exotic draughts.Book, Art: Plays, poems, and ballads or perhaps musical arrangements scribbled on loose parchment, Art books come in many forms. They also include treatises on perspective, form, and style, often written by famous painters or sculptors — such as Leonardo da Miragliano — for mass printing.Book, Cryptography: Where individual ciphers and encryption keys can be written on a single page or two, Cryptography books are often hand-scribed codices dealing with mathematics, numerology, and polyalphabetic encryption.Book, Engineer: The majority of engineering books are press-printed. Engineering is an advanced science in the Empire, largely due to the Imperial Engineers’ School in Altdorf and the Dwarf Engineers’ Guild. Because of this, Engineering texts are often authored, co-authored, or edited by Dwarfs.Book, Law: Laws vary considerably from one region to the next. Cities with printing presses compile legislation in bound volumes, whereas judges in smaller towns often rely on documents hand-written centuries ago. Law books used by travelling lawyers or judges often combine printed and written pages from different towns across the Empire, collated and bound together within the same cover.Book, Magic: Spell grimoires are usually scribed by wizards, and their covers are often secured with locks. Sometimes grimoires are even protected by magical alarms or wards. Carrying a spell grimoire is punishable as heresy unless the owning wizard is licensed by the Colleges of Magic.Book, Medicine: Medical texts can either be scribed or press-printed, depending on the authoring physician’s prestige. Illuminations are common, and usually include detailed autopsy drawings and procedural diagrams.t h e   c o n s u m e r s ’   G u I d e

Book, Religion: Religions books come in all forms in the Empire, a realm renowned for its religious observances. There is a eager market for the most popular texts, most of which are cheaply produced by printing presses.Guild License: Guild licenses are usually printed on single sheets of parchment, stamped with an official seal, and signed by the local guild master. Guild licenses are not purchased; instead, they are granted to guild members according to each guild’s traditions and laws.Legal Document: A simple legal document such as a will, IOU or letter of intent.OptiOns: Guildersif you have an appropriate guild license, you can use your special contacts to locate rare items. if you fail an Availability test when trying to buy an item, you can make a Gossip test to talk with your fellow Guilders and see if any of them know where you might find what you need. If you succeed, one of your contacts has a few useful suggestions, and you can reroll the Availability test. Trade Tools and WorkshopsTrade Tools are needed if your wish to take a Trade Test to make or fix something, and the examples below are a sample of the many options available. Workshops are needed for larger projects, such as creating new trappings.ItemCostEncAvailabilityTrade Tools3GC1RareWorkshop80GCN/AExoticApothecary: Tools include pestle and mortar, spoons, jars, and weights and scales.

Attitudes are more liberal in large cities where dens can be found offering spit, weirdroot, or Ranald’s Delight. Poison is not illegal either, but owning poison is bound to raise questions about its intended use.ItemCostEncAvailabilityBlack Lotus20GC0ExoticHeartkill40GC0ExoticMad Cap Mushrooms5GC0ExoticMandrake Root1GC0RareMoonflower5GC0ScarceRanald’s Delight18/–0ScarceSpit1GC 5/–0RareWeirdroot4/–0RareBlack Lotus: This deadly plant grows in Southland jungles and is used for blade venom.

Resisted with a Difficult (–10) Endurance Test.Heartkill: Combining the venoms from an Amphisbaena (a rare, two-headed serpent) and a Jabberslythe produces an odourless, colourless poison. When ingested, the deadly mixture inflicts 4 Poisoned Conditions. Resisted with a Difficult (–10) Endurance Test.Mad Cap Mushrooms: These hallucinogenic mushrooms are eaten by Goblin fanatics before battle. They induce a berserker rage, adding +10 Strength, +4 Wounds, and the Frenzy Talent. When the effect wears off, the user loses 1d10 Wounds. Non-Greenskins must also pass a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test or contract a Minor Infection. Duration: Active when chewed plus an additional 2d10 minutes.Mandrake Root: This highly-addictive deliriant grows under gallows, and is chewed to keep an unquiet mind still. Users must pass a Willpower Test every Round to perform an Action or a Move (choose one); further, Movement is halved. However, Cool Tests receive a bonus of +20. Duration: Active when chewed plus an additional 1d10×10 minutes.Moonflower: This tranquilliser is a dried moss which grows only on leaves in the Laurelorn forest. Elves use Moonflower to treat Black Plague, granting a bonus of +30 to any associated Tests for Elves to resist the disease, otherwise it has no effect on their species.

Moonflower is used by the most expensive Physicians as an anesthetic. Duration: 1d10+5 hours.Ranald’s Delight: This highly-addictive stimulant is a synthetic compound made from sulphur, mercury and other elements. Inhaling the powder provides a bonus of +1 to Movement, and +10 to WS, S, T, and Agi. This last for 3 hours, after which the user suffers a penalty of –2 Movement and –20 on Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, and Agility. Duration: 1 day.Spit: Extracted from Chameleoleeches found in the marshes of the Empire, this extraordinarily powerful hallucinogen brings visions of something deeply desired, such as a lost lover, a dead friend, or a missing child. Called Spit on the streets, it’s popular with those lost to despair. Upon exposure, you must pass a Very Hard (–30) Toughness Test or be lost to a fully real fantasy, which is a matter for the GM to handle. Duration: 1d10 minutes.Weirdroot: One of the most common street-drugs in the Empire, Weirdroot is chewed, bringing a sense of euphoria and pleasant hallucinations, which some suggest may be connected to the Winds of Magic. The drug gives a +10 bonus to Toughness and Willpower Tests, but a penalty of –10 to Agility, Initiative, and Intelligence Tests. Duration: Active when chewed plus an additional 1d10×10 minutes.Herbs and draugHtsMedicinal herbs can either be purchased or gathered from the wild (see Gathering Food and Herbs on page 127).

ProstheticsWhether through disease, warfare, or misfortune, it’s a relatively common occurrence in the Empire to lose body parts. For those who do, there are a variety of alternatives on offer.

Further, for 100 XP you can regain the last point of Movement Loss as you train yourself to use your new body part, and for 200 XP you relearn how to use Dodge again. This all requires you not to lose your False Leg, though.Gilded Nose: Though most are made of wood or ceramic, the term gilded nose is widely used regardless. You can ignore the Fellowship loss for having no nose.Hook: You have a hook strapped where you used to have a hand. A surprisingly nimble tool once you are used to it, you can buy back the –20 penalty on all Tests involving two hands for 100 XP per 5 you subtract from the penalty, removing the penalty completely for 400 XP. Append: In Close Combat, Hooks count as Daggers.Engineering Marvel: Only for the exceedingly rich, you commission a work of art from one of the Engineers’ Guilds, allowing you to completely ignore the loss of an ear, hand, arm, or leg, as steam hisses and machinery clicks in place of blood and muscle. Should you ever receive a Critical Wound to the marvel, it automatically breaks down, and needs to be taken back for costly repair (at least 10% of the base cost, depending upon the nature of the Critical Wound received).Wooden Teeth: False Teeth are often beautifully carved and painted, and sometimes a significant improvement to the originals. You ignore all penalties for loss of teeth.Miscellaneous traPPingsIf players wish to buy something that isn’t included on this list, the GM can reference similar items for price and availability guidelines.ItemCostEncAvailabilityBall5d0CommonBandage4d0CommonBaton1/–0CommonBedroll6/–1CommonBlanket8d0CommonCandle (dozen)1/–0CommonCanvas Tarp8/–1CommonChalk10d0CommonCharcoal stick10d0CommonCutlery3/60CommonDavrich Lamp2GC1RareDeck of Cards1/–0CommonCooking Pot8/–1CommonCup8d0CommonDice10d0CommonDoll2/–0CommonGrappling Hook1GC –/101ScarceInstrument2GC1RareLamp Oil2/–0CommonLantern12/–1CommonStorm Lantern1GC1ScarceMatch1d0CommonPan7/61CommonPipe and Tobacco3/40ScarcePlacard1/–2CommonPlate1/–0CommonBowl1/–0CommonRags1d0CommonRope, 10 yards8/41CommonTent12/–2ScarceTinderbox4/20Commont h e   c o n s u m e r s ’   G u I d e

It flares brightly in ‘firedamp’ (explosive gasses); after 1d10 rounds of exposure to the lamp the firedamp will explode. It is wise to withdraw before this happens.Grappling Hook: Coupled with a rope, allows unscalable surfaces to be climbed.Instrument: Various instruments are included in this category. The standard price and encumbrance reflects medium-sized instruments (e.g. mandolin, coach horn, small drum). Small instruments are half the price and 0 Encumbrance points (e.g. flute, recorder, tambourine). Larger instruments are double the price and 2 Encumbrance points (e.g. harp, lute, large drum).Lamp Oil: Contains enough fuel for 4 hours of standard use, or 8 hours of low flame equivalent to a candle.Lantern: Provides illumination for 20 yards.Storm Lantern: Shutters protect the flame from wind, and also enable the light to be directed in a 90° arc or darkened altogether. Provides illumination for 20 yards, or 30 when targeted.Tent: A medium-sized tent accommodating four people sleeping in close quarters. Small tents accommodate 2 people for half the price and 1 Encumbrance point. Large tents accommodate 8 people for double the price and 4 Encumbrance points.HirelingsIf you need extra muscle or brains whilst adventuring, you may pay Hireling NPCs to accompany you. You can hire any Career with GM permission, and they are paid an amount of coin equal to their Social Status for a quick job, or paid triple for a full day’s work. The GM may increase or decrease this amount according to individual personality and local circumstances. If the job at hand is unexpectedly dangerous, Hirelings will expect double the normal pay unless a Leadership Test is passed. Leadership Tests may also be required when Hirelings are assigned complex, independent tasks, or if they have good reason to flee from an encounter. Quick Hireling profiles are created by adding 5 Advances to every Career Characteristic and Skill per level of the Career hired, and 1 Talent per level. Hirelings with more experienced than this usually cost more.Sample HirelingSHirelingQuick JobDaily CostWeekly CostNotesLocal Scout5d15d10/–Works independently without Leadership TestsSeasonedMercenary3/–9/–3GC 12/–Demands a share of loot in lieu of danger payLawyer3/–9/–3GC 12/–Drafting a simple legal document costs 2–4 shillingsPorter1/–3/–1GC 4/–Carries 10 Encumbrance pointsScribe2/–6/–2GC 8/–Also translates 1-2 other common languagesDoktor5/–15/–5GCA single visit costs 4–6 shillings for medical attentionHencHmenHenchmen are Hirelings, companions, friends, pets, or other NPCs that are effectively permanent members of your party.

The Henchmen earns half the XP of that player, rounding down, which the player may spend on the Henchman’s behalf. Henchmen not only make memorable allies, but should your character die, they can also make marvellous PC replacements instead of creating a new character.XII

SpiderS

The creatures presented in the Bestiary are generic, typical starter 
examples of their ilk. You are encouraged to customise them and 
create your own, using the statistics found here and adding Skills 
and  Talents  as  you  feel  are  necessary,  perhaps  even  using  the 
full  Career  system  to  create  terrifying  opponents. The  quickest 
way to create fast NPC adversaries is to use Creature Traits; all 
creatures come with one or more Creature Traits as standard, but 
additional ones can be added as required, and they can be mixed 
with Skills and Talents as you see fit.

The Optional traits listed alongside each creature presents some 
of  the  most  commonly  found  variants  of  the  species.  However, 
you may choose to apply any trait to any creature if it fits what 
you want to represent in your game. 

For Creature Trait rules, refer to page 338.

cReAtuRe hit locAtionS

At some point you may need to determine a Hit Location for 
a  non-Human-shaped  creature.  Normally,  this  is  simple.  For 
quadrupeds,  simply  make  arm  hits  foreleg  hits,  and  leg  hits 
rear-leg hits. Or for birds, make arm hits equate to wing hits. 
However,  some  require  special  attention,  such  as  Snakes  and 
Spiders. For those, use Alternative Hit Locations.

For any creature 2 steps larger than you (see Size on page 341), 
choose a location to hit according to what’s closest to you (or in 
Line-of-Sight for shooting).

If an animal has a Hit Location without a Critical Table, such 
as a tentacle, tail, or wing, roll on the Arm table and describe the 
results in an appropriate way.

Chapter  2:  Character  presents  the  primary  peoples  of  the  Reikland. This  section  explains  how  to  create  fast  NPC  equivalents,  and  also 
introduces Ogres. 

For important characters in your campaign, you may want to use the full character creation rules. However, sometimes you just want a fast 
NPC. To quickly create an NPC, use one of the following standard profiles and apply Creature Traits as required, with those listed in Generic 
Creature Traits being the best initial choices.

ogRes
Big, loud, brutish, and extremely violent, Ogres are driven by the need to 
fill their prodigious, muscled bellies. They lack the wit or intelligence to 
do this cleverly, defaulting to might is right in most situations.  Hailing 
from lands far to the east, Ogres are a common sight in the Old World for 
they love to wander, always on the hunt for new meats over the horizon. 
As they pass through on decades-long food excursions, they work hard 
to integrate, wearing local clothing and following the local customs they 
understand, as that’s more likely to attract the next meal.

In  the  Empire,  they  frequently  serve  in  the  State  Army,  and  are  an 
everyday sight in larger towns, contracted as muscle for hire. The Halfling 
Gaffers Guild (building contractors) has effectively cornered the market 
in cheap Ogre labour in many towns and cities of the Empire, a source of 
great annoyance to their rivals.

‘yes, I summoned them because I needed reinforcements. yes, I know they are eating your prize cattle. and, yes, I know ogres have large appetites. ‘I‘ve 
put a notice on the local watch-house offering a small payment to anyone with the wherewithal to make them go. That should prove more than sufficient.’

– augustus von raushvel, Baron of raush vale

halFlInGs and oGres

none know why, but Halflings and Ogres just get on. Most elders of Halfling clans have one or two Ogre bodyguards, and it’s said 
the elder of the moot rarely travels without his old friend Zorarth legbiter, a hoary ogre who’s lived in the empire for almost a 
century. In return, many Ogre mercenary bands employ Halfling cooks. However, this relationship doesn’t always hold, such as when 
Golgfag Maneater, mercenary captain of the imaginatively named Golgfag’s Maneaters, famously employing a small clan of Halflings 
to feed him and his regiment after a great victory. Which was fine until Golgfag realised the cooks tasted far better than the food 
they’d prepared…

Below are two examples of Human NPCs created using just Creature Traits and standard random Characteristics.

BlaCk Bella — hUman BRigand
Bethilda’s  husband  was  slaughtered  by  Beastmen  raiding  the  village  of 
Reikherz. Four months later, she was evicted for failing to pay rent. Desperate, 
Bethilda  approached  her  cousin,  Alwin,  a  wanted  outlaw.  After  a  little 
persuasion,  Bethilda  joined  his  band  of  brigands  harassing  the  Karstadt–
Siedlung road and was surprised by just how exhilarating she found highway 
robbery.  Now  she  rides  as  Black  Bella  and  has  built  a  reputation  for  brutal 
ruthlessness that now concerns her cousin deeply.

Pol  thought  he  would  follow  in  his  parent’s  footsteps,  running  the  Blessed 
Bertram Bakery in Tahme, but the gods had another plan. It was on his twenty-
third birthday, the day his wife found out he’d been sleeping with her sister and 
tried to take their three children, that something snapped. Onlookers claimed 
his  eyes  glowed  yellow  and  orange  flames  erupted  from  his  hands.  As  far  as 
Pol was concerned, the world turned red as the bakery burned down. That was 
seven months ago. Pol has been on the road with his three children ever since, 
desperately fleeing Witch Hunters and the agents of his wife. He will not be 
caught. His children need him.

random creatures and custom pc specIes

The Bestiary presents Characteristics as a round number, such as 20, 25, or 30. Obviously, in practice, the numbers vary significantly 
from individual to individual. If you wish to randomly create characteristics, subtract –10, then add 2d10. so, a characteristic of 
30 translates to 2d10+20. If a characteristic starts at 5, roll just 1d10 to randomise it. this can even be used to create pcs out of 
traditionally npc species by using random characteristics and adding an appropriate career, creating, say, an ogre soldier, skaven 
engineer, or vampire noble. obviously, this will take a little bending of the rules to work, but if you are interested in playing characters 
like this, it’s not difficult to do.

the beAStS oF the ReiklAnd

Presented here are a smattering of the common wild and domesticated animals found in the Reikland. 

BeaRs
Wanderers of the Reikland’s wild places, Bears are solitary and usually shy, only turning 
aggressive when interlopers threaten their young or when wounded. When food is scarce, 
they  will  approach  unprotected  settlements  and  travellers,  especially  those  careless  with 
provisions.

as ferocious war mounts.

breeds, including those bred for war and dogfighting can be a formidable threat.

gianT RaTs
Rats  get  everywhere  and  are  especially  prevalent  in  the  cities  and  towns. The  more 
densely people are packed in, the more densely Rats are packed in with them, which is 
especially bad when the creatures carry disease. Though typically small, they can grow 
to monstrous proportions, with reports of rats beneath Altdorf the size of a Human 
and larger. Rat catchers are employed to keep them in check.

Giant Spiders lurk deep within the forests and caves of the Empire, but can live anywhere,

hoRses
Horses  are  bred  for  many  jobs,  including  speedy  mounts  for  messengers,  sturdy 
destriers for knights, and mighty drays for farmers. They are so useful, horse trading 
is almost a competitive sport in the Reikland. Unscrupulous ‘Horse Copers’ (horse 
salesmen) are keen to make money at the expense of the ignorant buyer, painting 
and filing teeth of elderly horses or stuffing rags up noses to soak mucous, so the 
unknowledgeable buyer should beware.

suffocation. Like many creatures of the Old World, they can grow to gigantic proportions, 
such as the enormous Fen Worm, posing a real danger to even the strongest mercenary.

wolves
Wolves usually hunt in packs and have a reputation for being tenacious hunters, pursuing 
their prey over dozens of miles without rest or respite. Several species prowl the Reikland, 
including the fierce Giant Wolves, which are captured and bred by Goblins to use as guards 
and mounts.

the monStRouS beAStS oF the ReiklAnd

Throughout the Reikland, all manner of large and dangerous monsters hunt, preying on the unwise and the unwary, dragging them back to 
their bone-lined lairs to be consumed at leisure.

Basilisks
These eight-legged reptilian creatures are solitary and elusive. Claimed to be one of the most ancient creatures of Chaos, they are said to be 
filled with such spite and venom the very ground they walk on is poisoned. Their bite, too, is poisonous, but it’s their petrifying gaze most fear. 
Rarely encountered these days, basilisks are a most dangerous foe. Their glands and organs are highly prized by wizards and alchemists, so 
opportunist hunters often chase rumours of Basilisks in the wild-places of the Vorbergland, though few return.

Bog oCTopUses
Bog  octopuses  skulk  in  shallow  waters,  usually  in  marsh  and  swampland. They  await  prey 
in perfect stillness, able to sense the vibrations of approaching creatures, then erupt from the 
muddy water, seeking to grapple and drown using their strong tentacles. Usually mottled green 
and  brown,  Bog  Octopuses  are  perfectly  camouflaged  for  boggy  environments,  their  huge, 
limpid eyes often the only clue betraying their presence. Most have tentacles of twenty feet or 
so and a body some six-feet long, but stories claim they grow many times that size, especially if 
they have a regular supply of meat.

knightly orders as war mounts. Unlike larger monstrous mounts, which are generally taken 
when young or bred in captivity, the capture of a full grown demigryph is a rite of passage 
among some orders.

Dragons ruled the skies long before the elder species walked the Known World. While the Dragons of today are mere shadows of their

fenBeasTs
Raised  by  spellcasters  from  the  filth  of  marshes  and  bogs,  Fenbeasts  are 
seemingly mindless automatons held together by magic. Vaguely humanoid, 
they are comprised of mud, bones, branches, and slime, and require significant 
quantities  of  magic  to  retain  their  integrity.  Occasionally,  they  are  raised 
by wizards skilled in Jade magic to act as a bodyguard or to fulfil a specific 
task  requiring  brute  strength  or  mindless  killing.  Sometimes  they  rise 
independently, spawned in stagnant festering pools where the flow of magic 
has been corrupted. The Jade College in Altdorf is said to maintain a score of 
the creatures as drudges, fetching and carrying for senior wizards, maintained 
by the ceaseless channelling of dozens of apprentices.

fimiR
Fimir are secretive, one-eyed, reptilian creatures that stalk the darkest recesses of the 
dank  swamps  and  boglands  of  western  Reikland. They  shun  sunlight,  usually  only 
appearing at dawn or dusk, or under the cover of mist and fog to spirit away victims 
for mysterious, loathsome purposes. Human witches reckless or desperate enough to 
meddle in the affairs of Daemons have been known to seek out the Fimir to learn 
their malign mysteries, for it is said they summon and control such entities. Whether 
the greater risk lies in trafficking with the Ruinous Powers, or treating with the Fimir, 
is anyone’s guess.  The Fimir have a matriarchal society. The leader of each clan is a 
powerful witch called a Meargh, and she’s aided by a cadre of lesser spellcasters called 
Dirach. The majority of the clan members are lowly Shearls, who are protected by a 
warrior caste, the Fimm, who have bony spikes and knobs on their tails, used to break 
the bones of unwary opponents.

 ‘We spent our honeymoon at the family’s summer house by the sea. one morning, when taking the air along the bluffs, the mist closed in. It was 
suddenly calm and strangely quiet. Then, out of nowhere… Bog Daemons! Huge, one-eyed, barrel-chested brutes. I was sent crashing to the ground with 
a swipe of a tail. another bundled Greta up and threw her over its shoulder. then they just vanished into the mist, as swiftly and as silently as they had 
appeared. I swear that is verena’s own truth.’

gianTs
Giants  are  solitary  creatures  who  usually  shun  civilisation.  Most  stalk  remote  and 
high places surrounding the Empire, holing-up in caves and forgotten ruins far from 
smaller folk, though they sometimes migrate to the foothills in search of food. They 
have a reputation for belligerence and ferocity, due in equal parts to their intimidating 
size, their cattle eating, and their association with marauding Greenskin armies that 
enslave  them.  In  truth,  many  giants  are  gentle  souls,  prone  to  raging  tantrums  and 
fiercely protective of their privacy, but not necessarily hostile to others. Because they 
are so long-lived, rumours suggest they hoard ancient lore, though most seem less than 
lucid, and certainly more interested in alcohol than debates about history.

gRiffons
With the forequarters and wings of an eagle and the hindquarters of a great cat, 
Griffons are elegant beasts with a naturally proud and regal bearing. They nest high 
in the mountains that surround the Empire and are swift, efficient killers, not prone 
to  the  indiscriminate  destruction  of  creatures  like  Manticores  or  Hippogryphs. 
Perhaps because of this seeming nobility, the image of the Griffon is extraordinarily 
popular in the Empire, used on heraldry, religious iconography, and as a symbol of 
the Empire itself. Griffons are also one of the most intelligent of beasts. If captured 
relatively young and subject to correct training, they can be incredibly loyal, able to 
anticipate and obey a wide variety of commands. They are so highly sought after 
that hunters regularly die trying to secure Griffon eggs to sell. Perhaps the most 
renowned  Griffon  in  Reikland  is  Deathclaw.  Housed  in  the  Imperial  Zoo  in 
Altdorf,  Deathclaw  is  personally  owned  by  the  Crown  Prince  of  Reikland  and 
was reputedly hatched by Emperor Karl-Franz himself — a story that led to all 
manner of lewd cartoons being printed in seditious pamphlets.

hippogRyphs
Extraordinarily ferocious and territorial, Hippogryphs normally have the head, 
wings, and front quarters of an eagle and the hind quarters of a horse. Hailing 
most commonly from the Grey Mountains, they attack without provocation, 
almost  reckless  in  their  fury,  tearing  flesh  into  ribbons  to  be  devoured  later. 
Such  is  their  rage,  entire  fields  of  livestock  will  be  wiped  out  by  a  single 
Hippogryph, which will then make off with its choice of meat, leaving the rest 
to  carrion  birds.  Having  little  in  the  way  of  intelligence,  when  Hippogryphs 
hunt, they tend to kill everything in sight, assuming anything unseen is gone 
forever, meaning that actual casualties to Hippogryphs are relatively low, given 
all it takes to avoid them is finding a good hiding place.

The  Jabberslythe  is  an  ancient  creature  of  Chaos  that  lurks  beneath  the  shadowy  eaves  of  the  deepest,  darkest  forests.  A  maddening 
creature, the Jabberslythe is a disguisting mixture of Toad, Sludge-drake, and Insect, all filled with corrosive, black blood that spurts free at 
the slightest wound. Worse, any viewing this horror seem to lose their minds, gibbering and rhyming, clawing at their eyes, and shrieking 
with manic laughter, which leaves easy prey for the Jabberslythe. 

Further, it has a sticky tongue that can lash out and pull its next meal into its gaping maw. As befits its appearance, the creature moves in a 
lolloping and awkward manner, and even possesses wings, though they’re too small to properly lift its bloated torso.

manTiCoRes
Fortunately  rare,  Manticores  are  unrelentingly  ferocious,  driven  to  clear 
their  territory  of  predatory  rivals  with  extraordinary  brutality.  This  means 
you normally know when you’re moving into the territory of a Manticore — 
corpses of other monsters litter the high grounds. The creature has the head 
and body of a twisted great cat (though sometimes its face appears almost too 
Human), the wings of a Bat, and a wicked, thrashing, barbed tail.

‘When I was travellin’ with the elves to ulthuan, I seen a great many things as would astound most folks back ‘ome. one time I saw a manticore, only 
in the centre of its lion-head it had the face of a great Elf! I suppose it was less a Manticore, than an Elf-ticore.’

pegasi
Pegasi are handsome white horses with great swan-like wings. They are dogged 
and inexhaustible flyers that fly in great herds in the high mountains, seemingly 
taking great delight as they swoop and swirl on the spiralling thermal currents.  
They are obvious candidates for steeds and many a warrior or scout has tried to 
catch a Pegasus of their own. They are very intelligent, and some believe they 
only allow themselves to be captured if they wish to be, which has led to all 
manner of fancifully romantic legends insisting only those worthy, or virtuous 
enough may be chosen.

TRolls
Trolls are filthy, foul creatures that infest all corners of the Old World. Quick to 
adapt to their surroundings they come in a variety of types, but all are huge and 
imposing. They are dim and led by their instinct for food, but they like to hoard and 
their lairs can be a trove of useful and valuable treasures… and the grisly remains of 
their meals. Although there are many species of Troll, they all share some common 
features: they are usually extremely stupid, which means any quick-witted foe can 
get an edge over them; they can regenerate, which makes them extremely difficult to 
kill; and they are able to regurgitate their last meal at will, vomiting acrid bile over 
a shockingly impressive distance — although they are loathe to do this as it leaves 
them extremely hungry.

 ‘I assure you, sir, we have done extensive surveys on this subject, and have lost some of our bravest taxonomists in this endeavour. there are precisely 
twenty-three varieties of Troll living in the Empire at this moment — including seventeen sub-varieties and two unverified sightings that are yet to be 
classified. This level of detail is exactly what the Imperial Society was set up to do; we know our figures are accurate.’ 

– Ignatius of nuln, man of letters

GoInG For a troll

there are a number of species of trolls so you should feel free to customise them at will. some of the trolls most likely to trouble 
parties in the reikland include:

chaos trolls:  these bear one or more mutations. these ‘gifts’ from the dark Gods of chaos make them especially dangerous and 
unpredictable. these unfortunate creatures are often pressed into the service of marauding chaos warbands, or Beastman Warherds — 
the more severely mutated the troll, the greater the perceived favour of the ruinous powers, and the greater the value of the monster 
to its herd. 

River  trolls:  skulking  in  the  stagnant,  foetid  marshes  of  the  reik,  river  trolls  are  an  unfortunately  common  sight.  they  are 
opportunistic hunters, using their weed-like hides as they float like clumps of weed or flotsam, or lie in wait in muddy banks waiting 
for small boats or unwary travellers. 

Stone trolls: Rarely seen outside of the mountain ranges of the Empire, Stone Trolls have exceedingly tough hides that have ossified 
into rough, stone-like armoured plates, which both protect the troll from damage and help them blend into their surroundings. they 
make their lairs in caves and are one of the most common hazards encountered by those crossing the Grey mountains.

wyveRns
Although  the  uneducated  often  mistake  them  for  Dragons,  beyond  their  superficial 
similarities, foul-smelling Wyverns are nothing like those dignified creatures. Cowardly 
scavengers with weak eyesight, they tend to sate their rapacious appetites by picking 
off defenceless creatures — mostly sheep and goats — avoiding outright combat when 
possible. Unlike other monsters of the Mountains, Wyverns are not especially territorial, 
and tend to move on when their hunting grounds are invaded.

the gReenSkin hoRdeS

Orcs  and  Goblins  are  the  scourge  of  civilisation. They  raid  ceaselessly  from  their  crude  fortifications,  most  commonly  warring  amongst 
themselves, culling the weak and revering the strong. Inevitably, a Greenskin warlord will eventually arise from these internecine skirmishes 
and bind the neighbouring tribes under one banner. Then the drums of war sound, and the green tide swells once more, ready to wash over 
every village and town in its path, leaving nothing but blood and ruin in its wake. 

oRCs
Orcs  are  nasty,  brutal,  belligerent,  and  almost  immune  to  pain. They  have  muscular, 
hulking bodies, wide, powerful shoulders, and won’t let a little thing like a lost arm get 
in the way of a good scrap. They are built for fighting and like nothing more than doing 
so. When they have no enemies to fight, they take on rival groups of Greenskins. If there 
is no rival group, they will fight among themselves. Though not as numerous as Goblins, 
they are bigger and tougher, and they let them know it at every opportunity. Orcs can 
grow to prodigious size, with larger Orcs stronger, tougher, and more aggressive, and 
therefore accorded more prestige: for might equals right in their warlike society. Some 
Orcs ride huge boars into battle, a sight that rarely fails to terrify.

Scrawny,  spiteful,  nimble,  and  intelligent,  a  Goblin’s  instinct  for  self-
preservation  should  never  be  underestimated.  Though  cowardly,  Goblins 
readily band together if this secures an overwhelming advantage in numbers. 
Goblins  frequently  join  with  Orc  armies  —  not  always  by  choice  — 
opportunistically  helping  themselves  to  the  spoils  of  war  while  others  do 
most of the actual fighting.

trying to overwhelm their foes through sheer weight of numbers. To do this 
they find all sorts of disgusting and noxious substances, like poisonous fungus 
and bodily waste, to hurl at their enemies.

the ReStleSS deAd

Neither living, nor truly dead, the Undead are the animate corpses of once living beings, granted an unholy parody of life through the fell 
arcane discipline of Necromancy. The shambling hordes of the restless dead come in many forms, from the reanimated corpses of Zombies 
and Skeletons, to the shrieking, spectral Ghosts and Banshees, to the brooding, manifest evil of the Vampire Lords.

skeleTons
Skeletons are the fleshless bones of those long dead, reanimated by dark magic 
to walk the earth as mockeries of the living. Those who died and were not laid 
to rest according to the rituals of Morr, the God of Death, may be resurrected 
in this form by a sufficiently powerful necromancer. Utterly mindless, Skeletons 
will fight until their bones are smashed to pieces. They have no courage for they 
have no fear. They cannot be killed because they are not alive.

‘I raised the heavy lid expecting to find the glorious golden death mask of Khetanken. But we had been misinformed. A bony hand flew out and grabbed 
my neck. startled, I dropped the lid, and the hand and lower arm were severed, trapping the undead creature within the sarcophagus.
‘But it held on tightly, squeezing my neck so I could hardly breathe! I thought I was going to die. But Sister Celestine threw some of her sacred water 
over the thing, and it became lifeless once more.
‘I use it as a back scratcher now.’

zomBies
Like Skeletons, Zombies are Undead creatures reanimated and bound together 
with  foul  magics.  Unlike  Skeletons,  they  are  so  recently  dead  that  much  of 
their corporeal body still exists, rotting and diseased flesh sagging over their 
maggoty,  swollen  organs.  As  they  fight,  their  flesh  and  organs  slough  from 
their bones, releasing a nauseating, noxious stench, powerful enough to turn 
the stomachs of all but the most hardened of soldiers.

unQuIet dead

any undead creature with the construct trait is magically bound together with sinews of dark magics. they are either mindless 
automatons reanimated by a necromancer, or those who came to unlife in a place where shyish, the magical wind of death, or dhar, 
vile black magic, gathers and stagnates, twisting death into something new. 

diRe wolves
When the earth gives up the dead, it is not just humans who rise; macabre parodies 
of Giant Wolves, with glowing eyes, and tatters of flesh falling from their rotting, 
festering  carcasses,  Dire  Wolves  prowl  the  night  on  behalf  of  their  necromantic 
masters. In the Reikland, they are said to roam the haunted forests of the Hägercrybs 
when Morrslieb is full, running wild in search of prey to sate their insatiable hunger, 
cursed with an appetite for flesh and a heightened instinct for the smell of blood.

Cairn Wraiths are especially potent spirits, the spectral remains of aspiring necromancers who sought

haunt the mist-shrouded cairns that dot the landscape of the Empire, such as the fell Hägercrybs.

Vampires see themselves as the rulers of the night. Many can pass as Human, some even functioning for long periods amongst the living. 
Despite their outwardly Human appearance, no heart beats beneath their pale skin, and in lieu of mortal hungers they possess an abiding thirst 
for blood.  All Vampires of the Old World are ultimately descended from ancient bloodlines that originated millennia ago far to the south. 
Many are fiercely proud of their heritage and the traits and traditions that set them apart from others. The Vampires of different bloodlines 
are often bitter rivals, but they are astute enough to come together when necessary to face greater foes.

Ghosts are the sprits of tormented souls who died with unfinished business. Much like

or  may  haunt  areas  suffused  with Dhar.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  particularly 
driven spirits may claw their way from the Realm of Morr in pursuit of their own 
business, though such occurrences quickly draw the attention of the cult of Morr, or 
the wizards of the Amethyst Order. When summoned through the necromantic arts, 
Ghosts swarm together, forming great Spirit Hosts that swoop and plunge amongst 
their foes, spreading fear and disarray in their wake.

SlAveS to dARkneSS

Chaos. The very word is enough to send superstitious smallfolk scurrying for the temple of Sigmar, making the sign of the hammer as they 
flee. But, for all good citizens of the Empire fear Chaos invasion or Beastmen attack, the true danger lies within the Empire’s borders; cultists 
lurk in basements, corrupt nobles treat with Daemons, and ignorant villagers make offerings of their mutated offspring rather than killing 
them swiftly, unwittingly swelling the ranks of armies of the damned. 

beAStmen, the childRen oF chAoS
Beastmen are grotesque hybrids of animal and Human. They consider themselves the true children of Chaos, blessed by the Dark Gods before 
all other species. Their savage herds stalk the forests, gathering numbers and worshipping at profane altars of stone daubed with excrement.

goRs
Gors, the most common Beastmen, haunt almost every forest of the Old World. Their 
appearance  varies  widely,  but  all  combine  bestial  and  Human  traits,  often  with  the 
heads and legs of Goats with the torso and arms of Humans. The only feature all Gor 
universally possess is a large pair of horns — the larger the better, for they denote status 
amongst Beastmen — a trait that distinguishes them from Ungor and Turnskins. The 
largest Gors are known as Bestigors.

Ungors have vestigial or very short horns and are thus barely considered ‘Gor’ by the rest of

malnourished in comparison to their larger-horned brethren, leaving them bitter creatures 
eager to take out their jealousy on others.

cultiStS, the loSt And the dAmned
Like a rotten beam beneath white-washed walls, a terrible enemy lurks unseen within the Empire. In every province and town, men and 
women are seduced by the subtle lures of Chaos, tempted by the promise of power, knowledge, strength, or release.

mUTanTs
One of the most tragic fates to befall a Human is to succumb to the mutating influence of 
Chaos. It can happen without rhyme or reason, and even babies can be born mutated. When 
such happens, many parents find they cannot summon the will to murder their children, so 
instead abandon their offspring to the woods, either to die or be taken in by other Mutants 
or Beastmen. No matter how innocent they may be, all mutants are a source of terror for the 
common folk, so most fall to the Dark Gods, abandoned and embittered, or end it all before 
it’s too late.

For those untainted by the blight of Chaos, it appears horrifyingly alien, but to those 
it affects, every step towards damnation, every idea bringing them closer to Chaos,

dAemonS, the gibbeRing hoStS
Daemons are blasphemous horrors from the Realms of Chaos, the unholy will of the Chaos Gods made manifest. In the Reikland, Daemons 
likely only appear if summoned by Cultists of the Ruinous Powers. Though their presence is unlikely to last for long as the material realm 
abhors their existence, the havoc they wreak is so profound that none who encounter Daemons ever forget the mind-fracturing experience. 

While most Daemons owe allegiance to one of the four Chaos Gods, some are simple beasts of the Aethyr, possessing no particular will of 
their own, spilling forth into the Old World in a frenzy of mindless destructiveness whenever they can. Only four samples of Daemons are 
given here — two Lesser Daemons and two Daemon Princes — but any other Daemon you require can easily be built using Creature Traits.

BloodleTTeRs of khoRne
Khorne’s chosen, Bloodletters stalk the battlefields of the Old World, taking skulls and 
lives in honour of the Blood God. Sharp, needle-like teeth protrude from monstrous, 
horned visages. Their blood-red skin is hard as brass, forged upon the anvil of ceaseless 
war. Each Bloodletter bears a Hellblade, a wickedly sharp blade steeped in gore, which 
it wields with reckless abandon, surrendering itself to the sweet sensation of senseless 
slaughter.

daemoneTTes of slaanesh
Like all creatures of the Prince of Pain and Pleasure, Daemonettes of Slaanesh are at 
once beautiful and horrifying. Possessing an unearthly allure that defies all sense and 
rationality, they render their enemies powerless to resist, so entranced are they by the 
profane sensuality of their monstrous forms. They have creamy, pale skin and large jet-
black eyes. Wild, flowing, unnaturally coloured hair graces their delicate crowns. In lieu 
of hands their slender arms terminate in sinuous, crab-like claws.

daemon pRinCes 
The ultimate goal of all champions of Chaos is apotheosis: to ascend to the rank of Daemonhood and serve their master for eternity as a 
Daemon Prince in the Realms of Chaos. Mighty figures of great power, Daemon Princes are terrible foes that even the greatest heroes of the 
Empire would balk to face.

the loAthSome RAtmen
Skaven are a malevolent species of ratmen living beneath everyone’s feet, watching, waiting, and impatient. They eke out a foul existence in the 
sewers and tunnels beneath the Empire’s cities and are so rarely seen that those who do usually dismiss them as mere Beastmen or Mutants. 
Few ever suspect the sinister truth: an Underempire exists right beneath their feet, its tunnels stretching between every city of the Old World 
and beyond.

Skaven society is built on the backs of slaves captured from across the Old World. Supporting this, many shady Humans supply slaves and 
warpstone in exchange for unsavoury favours and secret knowledge: for the Skaven spy network is vast and pervasive. 

Aware of the delicate position they inhabit, feasting on the subterranean entrails of other societies, the Skaven protect their secrets by any 
means necessary. Those foolish enough to talk openly of a complex civilisation of sentient ratmen beneath the Empire’s cobbled-streets may 
find themselves dead in a gutter, an unfortunate victim of an unlikely accident.

 ‘I never seen nothin’. there were no ratmen, you hear? Just bad luck. Wilbur slipped and fell, that’s all. he got careless, fell down a ladder onto his 
own knife. ten times. Just bad luck.’

 – Kristiana Fellger, retired sewer Jack

ClanRaTs
Most  Skaven  are  Clanrats,  hailing  from  one  of  the  many  complex  Skaven  clans  that 
constantly bicker, politic, backstab, and eventually war on each other. They generally act 
on the orders of higher-status Skaven, but are always looking for a way to secure a better 
position, most often by betrayal. They usually dress in mouldering leather or filthy cloth, 
with scraps of rusty and tarnished metal serving as makeshift armour. Clanrats are often 
sent out as scouts or raiders to scavenge for goods, search for warpstone, or raid for slaves.

sToRmveRmin
The elite fighters of the Skaven are the Stormvermin: bigger, stronger, tougher and more 
disciplined than Clanrats. They will serve as the core of any major assault and comprise 
the bodyguard of important Skaven. Stormvermin are usually well armed and armoured, 
sporting weapon combinations favoured by their clan.

RaT ogRes
Rat Ogres are hulking brutes, bred in the dark caverns of the Underempire by the demented

masters are fearless and unrelenting in combat. Rarely encountered on their own, they tend to 
be accompany Grey Seers, or other ranking Skaven, serving as a bodyguard.

cReAtuRe tRAitS

These are the Creature Traits. Use them to create unique NPCs.

Afraid (Target)
The creature gains Fear (0) to the Target. See page 190 for Fear rules.

Amphibious
The creature is at home in water. It can add its Agility Bonus to 
the SL of all Swim Tests and move at full Movement through 
water.

Arboreal
The creature is at home in the forests. In the woodlands, it adds 
its Agility Bonus to the SL of all Climb and Stealth Tests.

Animosity (Target)
The creature dislikes the Target. See page 190 for Animosity rules.

Armour (Rating)
The creature is protected by armour or thick hide.  It has Rating 
Armour Points on all Hit Locations. 

Belligerent
The creature loves to win a fight. As long as it has more Advantage 
than its opponent, it is Immune to Psychology.

Bestial
The creature has no rational thought or language. It shies away 
from fire and gains a Broken Condition if struck by it. In defence, 
it only uses the Dodge Skill. If it loses more than half its Wounds, 
it will attempt to Flee unless protecting its young or cornered, or 
unless it has the Territorial Trait. If so, it enters Frenzy (see page 
190). Bestial creatures have no Fellowship characteristic.

Big
The  creature  is  a  large  example  of  its  species.  It  receives  +10 
Strength and Toughness, and –5 Agility.

Bite (Rating)
On its turn, the creature may make a Free Attack by spending 1 
Advantage. The Damage of the attack equals Rating and includes 
the creature’s Strength Bonus already.

Free attacKs
a Free attack is a normal Ballistic skill or Weapon skill 
attack that does not use your action on your turn.

Blessed (Various)
The creature is Blessed and can enact Blessings; the relevant deity 
is indicated in brackets. 

Bounce
The  creature  can  bounce  high,  perhaps  with  powerful  limbs, 
magic, or stubby wings. When Charging or Running, it doubles 
its  Movement  Characteristic,  and  can  ignore  all  intervening 
terrain and characters as it leap over them.

Breath Rating (Type)
The creature’s breath is a powerful weapon. On its turn, for the 
cost of 2 Advantage, it can activate its Breath as a Free Attack. 
Choose 1 target it can see within 20+Toughness Bonus yards. All 
characters within Strength Bonus yards of that target are struck, 
as are all characters between the creature and the target. Perform 
an  Opposed  Ballistic  Skill/Dodge  Test  against  all  affected 
targets  (the  creature’s  single  roll  opposed  by  each  individual 
target).  All  targets  that  fail  take  Damage  equal  to  the  attack’s 
Rating. Further, if the Trait is marked with any of the following 
types in brackets, apply the associated rules.

•	 Cold: Targets gain a Stunned Condition for every full 5 

Wounds suffered (minimum of 1).

•	 Corrosion: All Armour and Weapons carried by affected 

•	

•	

•	

•	

targets suffer 1 Damage.
Fire: Any Wounds caused ignore Armour Points. Targets 
gain an Ablaze Condition.
Electricity: Any Wounds caused ignore Armour Points. 
Targets gain a Stunned Condition.
Poison: Any Wounds caused ignore Armour Points. 
Targets gain a Poisoned Condition.
Smoke: The area fills with smoke, blocking Line of Sight 
for Toughness Bonus Rounds.

The creature is immune to its own Breath. This attack is Magical.

Brute
The creature is heavy and brutish. It receives –1 Movement, –10 
Agility, and +10  Strength and Toughness.

Champion
The  creature  is  an  extraordinarily  skilled  warrior.  If  it  wins  an 
Opposed  Test  when  defending  in  melee  combat,  it  can  cause 
Damage just as if it was the attacker. 

Chill Grasp
The  creature’s  touch  chills  its  enemy’s  souls.  For  the  cost  of  2 
Advantage and its Action, it can attempt an Opposed Weapon 
Skill/Melee or Dodge Test. If it wins, its target loses 1d10 + SL 
Wounds with no modification for Toughness Bonus or Armour 
Points. This attack is Magical.

Clever
The  creature  is  particularly  sharp-minded.  It  receives  +20 
Intelligence and +10 Initiative.

338

B e s t I a r y

XII

Cold-blooded
The creature is cold-blooded and slow to react. It can reverse all 
failed Willpower Tests.

Constrictor
The creature can squeeze and crush its prey. Any successful roll 
to hit gives the target an Entangled Condition. The creature may 
then enter a Grapple if it wishes. See page 163.

Construct
The  creature  is  a  construct  of  magic,  quite  mindless,  bound 
together with magical sinews. It has no Intelligence, Willpower, 
or Fellowship Characteristics, and need never Test them. If it has 
no wizard controlling it, or does not possess the Territorial Trait, 
it meanders mindlessly, following flows of ambient magic. 

For the purposes of calculating its Wounds, it uses its Strength 
Bonus whenever Willpower Bonus is required. All its attacks are 
Magical.

Corrosive Blood
The  creature’s  blood  is  corrosive.  Every  time  its  is  Wounded, 
blood  splashes  free,  and  all  targets  Engaged  with  it  take  1d10 
Wounds  modified  by Toughness  Bonus  and  Armour  Points,  to 
a minimum of 1.

Corruption (Strength)
The creature is tainted by Chaos, or perhaps suffused with Dark 
Magics. The Strength of the Corruption is marked in brackets. 
See page 182.

Cunning
The creature is exceptionally cunning. It receives +10 Fellowship, 
Intelligence, and Initiative.

Dark Vision
The creature can see in the dark as daylight.

Daemonic (Target)
The  creature’s  essence  is  raw  magic,  and  unholy  ichor  pumps 
through  what  passes  for  its  veins.  Daemonic  creatures  do  not 
require the normal prerequisites for life: food, water, air…

All its attacks are Magical. Roll 1d10 after any blow is received, 
if  the  creature  rolls  the  Target  number  or  higher,  the  blow  is 
ignored, even if it is a critical. Should the creature be reduced to 
0 Wounds, its soul returns to the Realms of Chaos immediately, 
removing it from play. 

Die Hard
No  matter  how  hard  the  creature  is  hit,  it  gets  back  up.  All 
Critical Wounds not resulting in death can be healed; just attach 
the requisite body parts to the correct places, perhaps with staples 
or large spikes to hold them in place, and it’s good to go. Even 
‘death’ may be ‘healed’ if the appropriate parts, such as a lost head, 
are attached to the body. If death occurs and all parts are in place, 

it may attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test requiring an 
SL of 6 at the start of every round for Toughness Bonus Rounds 
after death. If a Test is successful, the creature chokes back to life 
with 1 Wound.

Disease (Type)
The creature carries the disease listed. Others will have to Test as 
appropriate for Contraction. See page 186.

Distracting
The creature distracts or confuse foes, possibly exuding a soporific 
musk  or  nauseating  reek,  or  maybe  its  appearance  is  bizarrely 
horrifying. All living targets within a number of yards equal to its 
Toughness Bonus suffer a penalty of –20 to all Tests. A target can 
only  suffer  this  penalty  once,  no  matter  how  many  Distracting 
foes there are.

Elite
The creature is a hard-nosed veteran. It receives +20 to Weapon 
Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Willpower.

Ethereal
The creature’s form is insubstantial, allowing it to pass through 
solid objects. It can only be harmed by Magical attacks.

Fast
The creature moves unexpectedly fast. It receives +1 Movement 
and +10 Agility.

Fear (Rating)
The creature causes supernatural Fear in other creatures, with a 
rating equal to its Rating. See page 190.

Flight (Rating)
As the creature’s Move, it can fly up to Rating yards. When flying, 
it ignores all intervening terrain, obstacles, or characters. At the 
end of the move, it decides whether it has landed or is still flying. 
It can use this move to Charge. If it starts its turn flying, it must 
choose to Fly for its Move. If it cannot do this, the GM decides 
how far the creature falls (see page 166).

When targeting it, measure horizontal distance as normal, then 
increase range by 1 step. So, a Long Range shot would become 
Extreme Range, and if it was at Extreme Range it could not be 
shot at all.

When  flying,  it  suffers  a  penalty  of  –20  to  all  ranged  combat 
attempts as it swoops and wheels in the sky.

Frenzy
The creature can Frenzy. See page 190.

Fury
The  creature  can  work  itself  into  an  all-consuming  rage.  It  can 
spend all of its Advantage (minimum of 1) to become subject to 
Hatred to close combat opponents. If the creature has at least 3 

339

XII

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Advantage, it may instead expend all of its Advantage to become 
subject to Frenzy. See page 190.

Ghostly Howl
The  creature  can  emit  a  chilling  howl,  capable  of  killing  those 
who hear it. On its turn the creature can spend all its Advantage 
(minimum of 2), to unleash a hideous scream as a Free Attack. 

Leader
The creature is a practiced leader. It receives a bonus of +10 to 
Fellowship and Willpower. Note: this Trait cannot be taken by 
creatures with the Bestial Trait.

Magical
The creature is wreathed in magic. All its attacks count as Magical, 
meaning it can harm creatures only susceptible to magical attacks.

All living targets within a number of yards equal to the creature’s 
Initiative  immediately  gain  3 Deafened  Conditions  and  suffer 
1d10  Wounds  ignoring Toughness  Bonus  and  Armour  Points. 
Those affected must also pass a Average (+20) Endurance test or 
gain a Broken Condition. 

Magic Resistance (Rating)
Magic has a reduced effect on the creature. The SL of any spell 
affecting it is reduced by the Rating given. So, Magic Resistance 
2 would reduce the SL by 2.

Hardy
The  creature  can  sustain  more  damage  than  most.  Increase  its 
Wounds  by  a  number  equal  to  its  Toughness  Bonus  (applied 
before any Size modifiers).

Hatred (Target)
The creature really hates the Target. See Hatred on page 190.

Horns Rating (Feature)
The  creature  has  horns  or  some  other  sharp  appendage  (if  its 
Horns  Trait  represents  a  different  feature  it  will  be  noted  in 
brackets). When the creature gains an Advantage for Charging, 
it may make a Free Attack with its Horns, performed as normal, 
using Rating to calculate Damage (its Strength Bonus is already 
included).

Hungry
The  creature  is  always  hungry  for  fresh  meat.  If  it  kills  or 
incapacitates  a  living  opponent  (or  encounters  a  fresh  body),  it 
must  pass  a  Average  (+20) Willpower  Test  or  feast,  losing  its 
next Action and Move.

Immunity (Type)
The creature is completely immune to a certain type of Damage, 
such  as  poison,  magic,  or  electricity.  All  Damage  of  that  type, 
including from a Critical Wound, is ignored.

Immunity to Psychology
Whether  brave,  exceedingly  stupid,  or  just  caught  up  in  the 
moment, the creature is utterly fearless. It ignores the Psychology 
rules. See page 190.

Infected
The creature, or its weapon, carries a nasty infection. If it causes 
a  living  opponent  to  lose  Wounds,  it  must  pass  an  Easy (+40) 
Endurance Test or contract a Festering Wound (see page 187).

Infestation
The  creature’s  hide  is  infested  with  biting  fleas  or  similar.  All 
opponents suffer a penalty of –10 to hit it in melee combat as the 
parasites distract and overwhelm them.

Mental Corruption
The  creature  has  Chaos  on  the  mind.  Roll  on  the  Mental 
Corruption Table found on page 185.

Miracles (various)
The creature can enact Miracles; the relevant deity is indicated 
in brackets. 

Mutation
The  creature  is ‘blessed’  with  a  Mutation.  Roll  on  the  Physical 
Corruption Table found on page 184.

Night Vision
The creature has the Night Vision Talent. See page 141.

Painless
The creature feels no pain or can ignore it. All non-amputation 
penalties  suffered  from  Critical  Wounds  are  ignored,  although 
Conditions are suffered as normal.

Petrifying Gaze
The creature’s gaze can turn flesh to stone. For its Action, it can 
spend all its Advantage to unleash its gaze (minimum of 1). The 
creature  performs  an  Opposed  Ballistic  Skill/Initiative  test, 
adding 1 SL per Advantage spent. Its opponent gains 1 Stunned 
status per 2 SL by which it wins. If it wins by at least 6 SL, its 
target is permanently turned to stone.

If  the  target  is  a  spellcaster,  the  test  can  be  Opposed  with 
Language (Magick) instead of Initiative as counter spells are cast.

Prejudice (Target)
The creature just doesn’t like the Target. See page 190 for rules 
on Prejudice.

Ranged Rating (Range)
The  creature  has  a  ranged  weapon. The  weapon  does  Damage 
equal to the Rating and the range in yards is marked in brackets.

Rear
For its Move, the creature may make a Stomp attack if it is larger 
than its opponent (see Size).

341

RegenerateThe creature is capable of healing at an extraordinary rate, even regrowing severed parts. At the start of each round, if it has more than 0 Wounds remaining, it will automatically regenerate 1d10 Wounds. If it has 0 Wounds remaining, it will regenerate a single Wound on a 1d10 roll of 8+. If it ever rolls a 10 for regenerating, it also fully regenerates a Critical Wound, losing all penalties and Conditions associated with it. Any Critical Wounds or Wounds caused by Fire may not be regenerated and should be recorded separately.Using sizeif you wish to use size to make a creature bigger — for example converting a giant spider to a gigantic spider — then increase strength and Toughness by +10 and reduce Agility by –5 per step of size you increase the creature. Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller.Size (Various)This trait represents creatures whose size differ from the game standard (i.e. roughly human sized). There are seven steps of Size, ranging from Tiny to Monstrous.Size ExamplesTiny Butterfly, Mouse, PigeonLittle Cat, Hawk, Human BabySmall Giant Rat, Halfling, Human ChildAverage Dwarf, Elf, HumanLargeHorse, Ogre, TrollEnormous Griffon, Wyvern, ManticoreMonstrous Dragon, Giant, Greater DaemonSize Combat ModifiersIf larger:•	Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.•	It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied. •	All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives(see page 160).If  smaller:•	It gains a bonus of +10 to hit. Defending Against Big CreaturesYou suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!Fear and TerrorIf the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2. See page 191.Moving in CombatA creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.Opposed StrengthDuring Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.  StompCreatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0 , and uses Melee (Brawling).WoundsLarger creatures have more Wounds:Size WoundsTiny 1Little Toughness BonusSmall (2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower BonusAverage Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower BonusLarge(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2Enormous (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4Monstrous (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8XII

Wa r h a m m e r   Fa n ta s y   r o l e p l ay

Skittish
The  creature  is  easily  scared  by  magic  or  loud  noises.  If  such 
occurs, it receives +3 Broken Conditions.

Spellcaster (Various)
The creature can cast spells; the specific Lore of Magic will be 
indicated in brackets. 

Stealthy
The creature is especially stealthy. It adds a number equal to its 
Agility Bonus to the SL of all Stealth Tests.

Stride
The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped 
or has especially long legs. Multiply Run Movement by 1.5 when 
Running.

Stupid
While not entirely devoid of self-awareness (and so lacking the 
Bestial trait), the creature is stupid. If it is near any allies without 
the Stupid Trait, they guide it and nothing happens. Otherwise, 
it must pass an Easy (+40) Intelligence Test at the start of each 
round, or become very confused. Should this occur it will drool, 
perhaps sitting down or picking its nose, doing little of use, losing 
both its Move and Action for that Turn.

Swamp-strider
The  creature  is  at  home  in  a  swamp.  It  suffers  no  Movement 
penalties for moving through boggy ground.

Swarm
Swarms are large numbers of the same creature acting as one. The 
swarm  counts  as  a  single  Creature  that  ignores  the  Psychology 
rules  (see  page  190),  and  can  ignore  the  Engaged  rules  when 
using  its  Move.  If  the  Swarm  successfully  strikes  an  opponent 
it  activates  the  Deathblow  rule  (even  if  it  has  not  killed  its 

opponent  —  see  page  160).  All  opponents  Engaged  with  a 
Swarm automatically lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round as 
the Swarm overwhelms anything close. The Swarm has five times 
the Wounds of a normal example of the creature and gains +10 
Weapon Skill. Any attempts to shoot the Swarm gain a bonus of 
+40 to hit. Swarms ignore all the Size Creature Trait rules.

Tail Attack (Rating)
The creature’s tail is capable of sweeping foes from their feet. On 
its  turn,  it  may  make  a  Free  Attack  by  spending  1  Advantage. 
The Tail does Rating Damage, which includes its Strength Bonus 
already. Opponents  with  a  smaller Size  than  the  creature,  that 
suffer any Wounds from the attack, also gain the Prone Condition.

# Tentacles (Rating)
The  creature  has  a  number  of  tentacles  equal  to  #.  It  gains  one 
Free Attack Action per tentacle. Each tentacle’s attack does Rating 
Damage, which includes its Strength Bonus already.  If  it  causes 
Damage,  it  can  also  give  its  opponent  an Entangled  Condition, 
which will initiate a Grapple between the target and that tentacle. 
If a tentacle is Grappling, use the tentacle’s Free Attack Action to 
resolve that Grapple, not the creature’s Action (see page 338).

Territorial
This creature is protective of a particular area or location. It will 
fight  to  the  death  to  protect  it  and  will  not  normally  pursue 
enemies if they flee this area. 

Terror (Rating)
The creature supernaturally causes bone-chilling Terror in other 
creatures, at the Rating given. See page 191.

Trained (Trained Skills)
This trait represents animals that have been trained through the 
Animal Training Skill. The skills the animal knows is marked in 
the brackets. Feel free to create your own trained skills. 

B e s t I a r y

XII

Broken: The animal is trained to ignore its Bestial trait. It receives 
2d10 Fellowship.
Drive: The animal is trained to pull a coach, cart, plough, buggy, 
or similar.
Entertain: The animal is trained to entertain others. It adds a +10 
bonus to appropriate Entertain, Perform, or Play Tests.
Fetch: The animal is trained to fetch. This is normal reserved for 
Dogs and similar.
Guard: The animal is trained to stay in one place or prowl around 
as a guard, granting it the Territorial Trait.
Home: The animal is trained to return home if it is released or lost.
Magic: The animal is trained to ignore Skittish when it comes to 
magic, which is required for most horses used by Wizards.
Mount: The animal will accept a rider. Some creatures are especially 
belligerent, and will not accept a rider without the correct skill. So, 
to ride a Griffon, you need the Ride (Griffon) skill.
War: The animal is trained for war, gaining +10 Weapon Skill. It 
can also ignore Skittish for loud noises.

Tongue Attack Rating (Range)
The  creature’s  prehensile  tongue  can  wrap  itself  around  prey, 
dragging  it  to  a  grisly  end.  On  its  turn,  it  may  make  a  Free 
Attack  by  spending  1  Advantage.  This  is  a  ranged  attack  that 
does Damage equal to its Rating (the range is in brackets). If the 
attack hits, the target receives 1 Entangled Condition and, if a 
smaller Size, is dragged towards the creature, and is Engaged in 
melee combat. The creature can then choose whether to release 
the target, perform a Free Attack using its Weapon Trait, or to 
keep the target wrapped in its tongue, initiating a Grapple (see 
page 163).

Tough
The  creature  is  more  resistant  to  damage  than  normal,  and 
unlikely to back down. It receives +10 Toughness and Willpower.

Tracker
Trackers are adept at following their prey, generally through scent 
or  hearing. They  add  SL  equal  to  their  Initiative  Bonus  to  all 
Track Tests.

Undead
The Undead are neither living, nor dead, meaning they are not 
reliant on the usual prerequisites for life: air, food, water… This 
Trait  most  commonly  come  into  use  when  spells,  miracles,  or 
other abilities affect Undead only.

Unstable
The  creature’s  corpus  is  maintained  by  foul  magics  that  are 
inherently  unstable  in  the  material  realm.  Whenever  it  ends  a 
Round  engaged  with  any  opponents  with  higher  Advantage, 
the  creature  is  driven  back,  and  the  magics  holding  it  together 
weaken. It loses as many Wounds as the difference between its 
Advantage, and the highest Advantage engaged with it. So, if the 
creature had 1 Advantage, and its opponent had 3, the creature 
would lose 2 Wounds. If the creature ever reach 0 Wounds, the 
magics holding it in place collapse, and it ‘dies’.

Vampiric
The  creature  feeds  on  blood  and  draws  great  physical  strength 
from  this  act.  Whenever  it  performs  a  successful  Bite  attack 
against an appropriate opponent, it heals as many Wounds as its 
opponent loses. Drinking blood in this way is the only way it can 
heal.

Venom (Difficulty)
The  creature’s  attacks  are  poisoned  or  envenomed.  When  it 
causes  Wounds,  its  opponent  gains  a Poisoned  Condition.  If 
no Difficulty is marked to resist the Venom, it is assumed to be 
Challenging. See page 169.

Vomit
The creature can spew a stream of corrosive corruption, dowsing 
its opponents in foul, semi-digested filth. On its turn, by spending 
3 Advantage, the creature can activate its Vomit as a Free Attack. 
The creature chooses 1 target it can see within Toughness Bonus 
yards and lets loose; all targets within two yards are also hit.

The  creature  performs  an  Opposed  Ballistic  Skill/Dodge 
Test  against  all  affected  targets  (its  single  roll  opposed  by 
each  individual  target). The Test  is  typically  Easy (+40)  for  the 
vomiting creature, due to the close range, and Challenging (+0) 
for  opponents.  All  losing  targets  suffer  a  hit  with  a  Weapon 
Damage  of  the  creature’s  Toughness  Bonus  +4  and  receive  a 
Stunned condition.

All  Armour  and  Weapons  carried  by  affected  targets  suffer  1 
Damage as the acidic vomit corrodes it away.

Ward (Rating)
Perhaps because they are magical, wear a special talisman, or are 
just plain lucky, some blows just seem to miss. Roll 1d10 after any 
blow is received, if the creature rolls Rating or higher, the blow is 
ignored, even if it is a critical.

Wallcrawler
The  creature  can  effortlessly  scale  vertical  surfaces  and  even 
traverse ceilings, ready to drop on unwary prey. It moves at full 
Movement  across  any  appropriate  surface  and  automatically 
passes all Climb tests.

Weapon (Rating)
The  creature  carries  a  melee  weapon,  or  uses  teeth,  claws,  or 
similar in combat.

The  weapon  causes  Damage  equal  to  its  Rating  which already 
includes the creature’s Strength Bonus. Typically it will be 4 + its 
Strength Bonus (representing a Hand Weapon).

Web (Rating)
The creature can create webbing to trap unwary foes. Whenever 
it  successfully  hits,  opponents  gain  1 Entangled  status,  with  a 
Strength of the Rating given. See page 168.
