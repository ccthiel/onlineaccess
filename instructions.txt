For this chat I'm going to provide you several links. I'm going to refer to all links I provide you collectively as "the books" or "the documents". Any time I provide you a link, I want you to use the Link Reader plugin to fetch the contents at the link and analyze it. When I ask questions, I want you to know which books may contain information pertaining to that question. You may use Link Reader to read the books as many times as you need in order to provide me the most detailed and accurate answers to my questions. I don't want you to use any other knowledge to answer my questions other than the books I provide you, including knowledge you yourself may already have. Only use information from my books.
